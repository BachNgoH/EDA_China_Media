But now he can finally savour the fruit fresh, right on his doorstep.\nIn late August, a shipment of 15 tonnes of fresh\nMalaysian\ndurians landed at\nZhengzhou Xinzheng International Airport\n, following quarantine approval for entry into the Chinese market in June.\nThe delivery was the first entry of fresh Malaysian durians into the Chinese market, buzzing with demand from eager consumers who are used to buying the thorny, pungent fruit from\nThailand\n,\nVietnam\nand the\nPhilippines\n.\nThe durians were swiftly distributed via cold chain logistics from the airport in Zhengzhou to cities including\nShenzhen\n,\nGuangzhou\nand\nShanghai\n. On\nJD\n.com, a leading e-commerce platform in China, the initial stock sold out within two hours.\n\"I love durian and bought one the next day to share with my family,\" said Guo, who purchased the fruit at a local store.\nGrown across tropical\nSoutheast Asia\n, the durian is known as the \"king of fruits,\" and its avid consumers enjoy its creamy texture and intense aroma.\nChina's appetite for this thorny fruit has soared in recent years. The country imported around 1.43 million tonnes of fresh durians in 2023, a year-on-year increase of over 70 %, with 929,000 tonnes sourced from Thailand and 493,000 tonnes from Vietnam.\nIndustry experts and business leaders are optimistic about the potential of the Chinese durian market.\nEric Chan Yee Hong\n, president of Malaysia's Durian Manufacturing Association, noted that Malaysia exported 25,000 tonnes of frozen whole durians and durian pulp to China in 2023.\n\"Now, with fresh durians entering the Chinese market, export volumes are expected to rise further,\" Chan said. \"We have been seeking efficient and reliable logistics channels, and ultimately decided to air-freight top varieties to Zhengzhou first, offering consumers the best quality and flavour.\"\nHenan Province\n, of which\nZhengzhou\nis the capital city, has nearly 100 million residents and is situated in central China. It boasts a well-developed logistics network that integrates road, rail and air transport.\nCurrently, a direct flight from\nKuala Lumpur\nto Zhengzhou takes as little as five hours, and airport customs in the latter have established a green channel for cold chain goods, ensuring rapid inspection and expedited clearance procedures upon arrival.\n\"Chinese consumers can enjoy fresh Malaysian durians within 24 to 36 hours thanks to the efficient logistics network,\" said\nSheng Weihua\n, marketing director at Zhengzhou Chen's\nSun Fruit and Vegetable Trade Co., Ltd.\n\"As supply increases and consumer demand grows, the durian market is poised for further expansion.\"\nIn the first seven months of this year, Henan imported fresh durians worth a total of 210 million yuan (about 29.53 million U.S. dollars), a year-on-year increase of 214.3 %, according to data from Zhengzhou Customs.\nAs the fresh durian trade continues to develop, the frequency of flights between Kuala Lumpur and Zhengzhou is expected to increase, and plans are in the works to gradually introduce seafood, flowers and other speciality products from Malaysia, Indonesia and neighbouring countries to China.\nLoh Wee Keng\n, chairman of the Malaysian Chamber of Commerce and Industry in China, said the entry of fresh Malaysian durians into the Chinese market is a new beginning.\nLeveraging Zhengzhou and Kuala Lumpur as dual hubs, the air route is set to expand to more countries, creating new opportunities for commercial cooperation under the frameworks of the\nRegional Comprehensive Economic Partnership\nand the Belt and Road Initiative, he said.&nbsp;\nXinhua\n&nbsp;\nTAGS\nEconomic\nChina\nMalaysia\nDurian\nHenan\nMusang King\nRelated\nThaksin proposes ideas to develop Thailand's Northeastern region\nDecember 20, 2024\nDSI\u2019s case against iCon Group execs ready for prosecution\nDecember 20, 2024\nNew Year festivities expected to net over THB62 billion\nDecember 20, 2024\nMOST VIEWED\n1.\nThaksin proposes ideas to develop Thailand's Northeastern region\n2.\nUncover Sisaket\u2019s creative heart through music at vibrant festival\n3.\nSuriya unveils plans for closer Thailand-China railway link\n4.\nDSI\u2019s case against iCon Group execs ready for prosecution\n5.\nNew Year festivities expected to net over THB62 billion",

It's not only the exchange of goods but also people-to-people interaction.\"\nThis upbeat note, shared among contestants, also struck a chord with their Chinese counterparts. During a session with the finalists,\nLuo Ying\n, the national second runner-up in the\n2022 21st Century Cup National English Speaking Competition\n, and a postgraduate student at\nPeking University\n, appealed for a step-up in international communication among youths.\n\"The Belt and Road Initiative is about connecting the dots between people, cultures and nations,\" she said. \"The experience we share and the relationships we build are the lines that connect the dots, forming a path toward a more inclusive and understanding world.\"\nThe competition, initiated last year by\nVDO English\n, the educational arm of\nChina Daily Hong Kong\n, and the\nRVIPS\n, the publishing arm of the RVi Group, a social enterprise dedicated to international education based in Singapore, aims to hold forth an annual regional celebration of linguistic prowess, take the pulse of the younger generation, and push for integration of fresh voices into cross-cultural dialogues.\n\"Since its launch in 2019 as one of our major undertakings capitalizing on the BRI, the competition has been aligning itself with the initiative's goals and missions, committed to promoting cultural diversity and exchanges,\" said Tan Yan, deputy general manager of\nChina Daily Asia-Pacific\nand director of VDO English.\nArgus Ang\n, CEO of RVi Group, said: \"Applause should be given to all participants who have spoken at the stage with their public speaking power.

It takes more than 20 days to ship goods by sea between Kunming and Selangor.\nThe trial freight train will pave the way for future rail services and is anticipated to be fully operational by September.\n\u201cThis initiative not only strengthens the existing cooperation in the rail transport sector but also opens the door to future collaborations, potentially even in the development of high-speed rail projects between China and Malaysia for passengers,\u201d said\nZahid\n.\nZahid said that\nChina State Railway Group Corp\n(\nChina Railway\n) will be the operator for this route and that Malaysian railway company\nKeretapi Tanah Melayu\n(\nKTM\n) should take this opportunity to establish its cooperation with\nChina Railway\n.\nA source told ST that both China Railway&nbsp;and KTM are likely to cooperate as operators for the new cargo rail route.\nKTM declined to respond to ST\u2019s queries on plans for the new freight train service, while China\u2019s embassy in Malaysia was unreachable.\nChina has been ramping up new rail links bridging its southern provinces with countries in\nASEAN\n, which is its largest trading partner. In 2023, it pledged to push\nYunnan\n\u2013 which borders Myanmar, Vietnam and Laos \u2013 as a gateway to the vast market of Southeast Asian countries and to forge closer ties with the region.\nIn June 2024, representatives from Malaysia, China, Laos and Thailand launched the\nAsean Express\ncargo train, which is operated by KTM. The weekly service connects Selangor to the Chongqing municipality in south-west China, via Thailand and Laos.\nThe first Asean Express train carried electrical appliances and agricultural products. KTM said in August 2022 that the Asean Express train will be the main choice for importers of electrical and electronic goods because of its lower cost.\nChina has been Malaysia\u2019s top trading partner for the past 15 years, with total trade in 2023 valued at RM450.84 billion.\nIn the first half of 2024, Malaysia\u2019s bilateral trade volume with China rose by more than 10 per cent, surpassing US$100 billion,&nbsp;as a result of the\nBelt and Road\nInitiative, said Chinese Embassy Minister Counsellor\nLin Shiguang\n&nbsp;in July.\nZahid said: \u201cIn line with the 50-year diplomatic ties between Malaysia and China this year, Malaysia aims to export halal products produced by SMEs with lower logistics cost, while China plans to export its fresh vegetables from Yunnan to Malaysia.\u201d\nChina is emerging as a key consumer market for Malaysia\u2019s halal exports such as durians and birds\u2019 nests, said Malaysia External Trade Development Corp deputy chief executive\nAbu Bakar Yusof\nin July.\nMalaysia\u2019s halal exports are expected to reach RM65 billion by 2025 from RM54 billion in 2023.\nAs China expands new trade routes to Malaysia, economists say that small and medium-sized enterprises (\nSMEs\n) in Malaysia will benefit from greater access to regional markets involved in the rail link at a lower cost.\nEconomists expect logistics costs to be reduced by 20 %, similar to the savings Malaysian Transport Minister\nAnthony Loke\nsaid the Asean Express achieved.\nShankaran Nambiar\n, a fellow at think-tank\nInstitut Masa Depan Malaysia\n, said: \u201cSMEs such as food manufacturers in Malaysia will find these additional routes faster and less expensive due to lower logistics costs.

The construction on Thailand\u2019s part began in 2017, followed by&nbsp;years of delays.\nThe first phase covers a distance of 253 km from the capital to the northeastern province of Nakhon Ratchasima, comprising 14 work contracts with an estimated total budget of 179.41 billion baht,\nAnan Nimphodaeng\n, deputy governor of SRT, said.\nHowever, the railway authority has had to adjust the draft plan for contract no.3-5, covering the distance from Khok Kruat to Nakhon Ratchasima stations, switching from a ground-level track to an elevated track over a distance of 7.85 km, he said.\nThe change, expected to cost an additional 2.05 billion baht, aims to minimise the impacts on surrounding communities and facilitate future land development, Anan explained.\nHe added that the additional funding required is still within the limit of the total budget approved for this phase, of which about 10.86 billion baht remains.\nThe SRT expects the change to be approved by its board and the Transport Ministry in September.\nAnan said the second contract currently on hold is no. 4-5, running from Ban Pho to Phra Kaew station in Ayutthaya province over a distance of 13.3 km with a budget of 9.91 billion baht.\nHe said the Office of Natural Resources and Environment Policy and Planning has ordered the SRT to prepare an HIA (Heritage Impact Assessment) report on the Ayutthaya Historical Park, where a new station will be built. The authority submitted the report on August 9 and is waiting for approval, he added.\nThe last contract that is hitting a snag is no. 4-1, covering the Bang Sue-Don Muang section with a budget of 9.02 billion baht. Anan said the SRT is currently waiting for the contractor working on the high-speed rail linking 3 airports, which has an overlapping area, to sign a deal accepting the terms of SRT working on this area.\nThe draft of the deal is being reviewed by the Eastern Economic Corridor Office and should be ready for signing after this month, said Anan.\nIn summary, of the total 14 contracts under phase one, two are now completed, nine are under construction, and three are on hold, he said.\nThe high-speed railway will link China and Thailand via Laos as part of China\u2019s global Belt and Road Initiative. Phase 2 from Nakhon Ratchasima to Nong Khai will link with the Laos-China railway and is expected to open in 2030, marking the completion of the project.\nTAGS\nHigh Speed Rail\nThai-China high-speed railway\nNakhon Ratchasima\nThe State Railway of Thailand (SRT)\nConstruction\ndelays\nBreaking News\nRelated\nThaksin proposes ideas to develop Thailand's Northeastern region\nDecember 20, 2024\nDSI\u2019s case against iCon Group execs ready for prosecution\nDecember 20, 2024\nNew Year festivities expected to net over THB62 billion\nDecember 20, 2024\nMOST VIEWED\n1.\nThaksin proposes ideas to develop Thailand's Northeastern region\n2.\nUncover Sisaket\u2019s creative heart through music at vibrant festival\n3.\nSuriya unveils plans for closer Thailand-China railway link\n4.\nDSI\u2019s case against iCon Group execs ready for prosecution\n5.\nNew Year festivities expected to net over THB62 billion",

In return, Thailand will release more incentive measures to support their development,\" said Thailand's minister of industry, Pimphattra Wichaikul.\nSpeaking at a recent forum, Pimphattra noted the important role the EV industry will play in the country achieving its sustainable development goals. \"This will not only benefit us but also future generations,\" she said.\nAs countries are becoming more aware of the impact of climate change, EVs have become more important for them to achieve their green development goals.\nIn February, Thai Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin unveiled his \"Thailand Vision \"at Government House, which laid out ambitious plans for making the country a hub for tourism, medical services, food, aviation, logistics, electric vehicles, the digital economy, and finance.\nSrettha said his government aimed to turn Thailand into a future mobility hub with a goal of drawing over 1 trillion baht ($28.67 billion) in foreign investment. \"Thailand used to be called the Detroit of Asia. Now, the auto industry is transforming into the EV industry so Thailand will become a hub of future mobility,\" Srettha said.\nThe government also outlined three major measures \u2014 developing skilled workers, increasing EV usage, and supporting research and development \u2014 to build Thailand into the biggest EV production hub in Southeast Asia.\nLast year, about 76,000 EVs were sold in Thailand, with about 80 %&nbsp;of them Chinese models, according to Thai authorities.\nMany Chinese automakers, including MG, Great Wall Motor, NETA, Changan and GAC Aion, have chosen the kingdom as their primary production base in the region.\nAccording to The Board of Investment of Thailand, most Chinese EV makers have agreed to the government's request to use auto parts made by Thai companies. Great Wall Motor, for instance, wants to source 80 to 90 %&nbsp;of its EV components from local materials.\nChongqing-based Changan Automobile, which has committed to investing up to 10 billion baht in Thailand, will start with a local content proportion of 60 %, increasing it to 90 %&nbsp;in the future, the Bangkok Post reported.\n\"Chinese EV enterprises are bringing production lines to Thailand, which not only enhances local employment but also meets the requirement of our own target of transforming some eastern provinces into a new corridor of innovation and economic growth,\" said Kanate Wangpaichitr, assistant secretary general of the Eastern Economic Corridor, an economic promotion zone.\nThe EEC lies at the heart of Thailand's 20-year strategy to achieve high-income status by 2036 through a range of top-down initiatives\n\"Collaboration between Thailand and China on high-quality EV production is a reflection of China's modernization and its benefits to the Global South,\" said Wirun Phichaiwongphakdee, director of the Thailand-China Research Center of the Belt and Road Initiative.\nHe said China's high-quality development and high-level opening up provide great opportunities for Southeast Asian countries to accelerate industrial upgrades and reforms through joint efforts with China.\n\"For example, the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area and EEC \u2014 two areas that enjoy close proximity \u2014 can make their respective advantages complementary to each other.

        "content": "News\nChina recovers robustly, undertakes strategic restructuring toward quality growth\nTUESDAY, JULY 09, 2024\nPlay\nChina\u2019s economic recovery has continued to gain traction aided by a rebound in external demand and diminishing drag from its real estate sector correction.\nGDP growth is projected at 5.3 %&nbsp;in 2024 and 4.9 %&nbsp;in 2025. The authorities have embarked on a major restructuring of the economy through mobilizing \u201cnew quality productive forces\u201d in the economy to enhance the quality of growth and transition to a technologically advanced economy. This is according to the preliminary assessment by the ASEAN+3 Macroeconomic Research Office (AMRO) after its Annual Consultation Visit (ACV) to China from June 4 to 18, 2024.\nThe AMRO team was led by Lead Economist Jae Young Lee, while AMRO Director Kouqing Li and Chief Economist Hoe Ee Khor participated in key policy meetings. The discussions centred on the drivers of the recovery and short-term risks; the effects of geoeconomic fragmentation on global supply chains and trade patterns; the correction in the real estate sector; strains in local government finances and long-term fiscal management; and key structural challenges.\nEconomic developments and outlook\n\u201cChina\u2019s growth is expected to come in at 5.3 %&nbsp;in 2024. Consumption remains the primary growth driver, supported by greater traction in investment and a rebound in external demand,\u201d said Dr&nbsp;Lee. \u201cDue to a robust supply-side recovery, inflation was subdued at 0.2 %&nbsp;in 2023, and 0.12 %&nbsp;in January-May 2024 but is expected to rise to an average of 0.8 %&nbsp;for the whole year.\u201d\nDespite strong external headwinds and a downturn in the real estate sector, China\u2019s economy was resilient and grew by 5.2 %&nbsp;in 2023. Helped by a rebound in external demand and supportive fiscal and monetary policies, the economy is expected to gain momentum for further recovery in 2024 before moderating to a trend rate of 4.9 %&nbsp;in 2025.\nThe country\u2019s macroeconomic fundamentals remain sound. Both consumption and investment, especially in high-tech manufacturing and high-tech services, are expected to pick up further. The real estate sector is undergoing a major correction and is expected to bottom out in the first half of 2025 as policy measures take greater effect and sentiment improves. Trade recovery is well underway, led by an upturn in the electronics cycle, bringing positive spillovers to domestic economic activities.&nbsp;\nRisks and vulnerabilities\nThe balance of risks is slightly tilted to the downside, with uncertainties in the external sector and challenges domestically.\nExternal risks include an unexpected tightening in US&nbsp;monetary policy due to persistent high inflation, as well as escalating geopolitical tensions or adverse geopolitical events. These risks could drag global growth down, heighten protectionist measures, or cause more damaging geoeconomic fragmentation.\nMajor domestic risks include potential setbacks in the recovery of the real estate sector, persistent financial strains on some local governments, and a deterioration in the asset quality of some rural commercial banks.\nLonger-term challenges would stem from climate change, de-globalization, and population ageing.\nUpside risks include external demand exceeding expectations, a more rapid recovery of the real estate sector, and positive spillovers to domestic consumption and investment.\nPolicy recommendations\nTo realize its economic growth potential, China must intensify its structural reforms to contain and defuse near-term risks and address long-term challenges. Tackling structural and longer-term challenges demands forward-looking policies.\nFiscal policy should continue to support the economic recovery, help create more jobs in the near term and support economic restructuring in the longer term. However, the larger fiscal deficits over the last few years have led to a notable increase in the debt/GDP ratio, hence China should implement fiscal consolidation over the medium term to rebuild its fiscal space. Sustained fiscal consolidation could include phasing out tax relief measures when appropriate, introducing revenue-enhancing measures, and tightening investments of local government financing vehicles (LGFVs).\nMitigating heightened fiscal strains that weaker local governments face requires a multipronged strategy, involving coordinated efforts and long-term commitments. There is a need to continue improving the allocation of fiscal responsibilities, revenue-sharing, and spending between the central and local governments.\nReducing and capping the stock of LGFV debt is a top priority to prevent systemic spillovers to the financial sector. Although strict supervision and oversight of LGFVs are in place, a comprehensive market-based strategy is necessary to facilitate debt restructuring and mitigate debt-related risks.\nIn this regard, the Chinese authorities have taken a proactive approach which has had significant positive effects. Measures taken over the past year include those which enable local governments to secure refinancing and help the ones facing greater strains to defuse risks related to hidden debt, imminent debt maturities, and debt-servicing burdens. Overall, risks related to local government and LGFV debt are under control.\nMonetary and credit policies have been accommodative, and there is room to provide more targeted support to sectors which are still lagging behind in the recovery such as real estate. While the financial sector is sound as a whole, there are pockets of weakness among some regional banks which should be addressed. In particular, some of the rural commercial banks need to strengthen their balance sheets.\nReal estate policies should facilitate the sector\u2019s near-term recovery by supporting overstretched yet viable developers, improving market sentiment, and mitigating oversupply. Decisive reforms are essential for the sector\u2019s long-term development, including the proper use of funds, prevention of over-expansion, and strengthening of the pre-sale framework of housing units to minimize the risk to buyers of being stranded.\nThe Chinese authorities are confident of achieving high-quality economic growth by intensifying structural reforms and leveraging technological innovations to boost productivity and efficiency. China should also take measures to upgrade its labor force to meet the needs of the new economy, improve the working conditions of migrant workers, and strengthen the social security system to meet the needs of the aging population. These measures will also help boost domestic consumption and its role as a driver of growth.\nAmid geoeconomic fragmentation, China should remain committed to adhering to the multilateral rules-based trading system and step up efforts to enhance economic linkages and promote cooperation worldwide, with the ASEAN+3 region as a key partner. The reprioritization of the Belt and Road Initiative to focus on renewable energy and sustainable growth projects is welcomed as it will contribute to the global climate change agenda. The shift will also encourage renewable energy companies in China to invest in BRI countries and add to global growth.&nbsp;\nAMRO would like to thank the Chinese authorities and other participating organizations for their strong support, excellent arrangements, and candid sharing of views and ideas.\nTAGS\nChina\neconomy\nstrategic\nquality\nGrowth\nRestructuring\nRelated\nThaksin proposes ideas to develop Thailand's Northeastern region\nDecember 20, 2024\nDSI\u2019s case against iCon Group execs ready for prosecution\nDecember 20, 2024\nNew Year festivities expected to net over THB62 billion\nDecember 20, 2024\nMOST VIEWED\n1.\nThaksin proposes ideas to develop Thailand's Northeastern region\n2.\nUncover Sisaket\u2019s creative heart through music at vibrant festival\n3.\nSuriya unveils plans for closer Thailand-China railway link\n4.\nDSI\u2019s case against iCon Group execs ready for prosecution\n5.\nNew Year festivities expected to net over THB62 billion",

The project should start as soon as possible,\u201d he said, in a special video address to the nation at noon today.\n\u201cI think the government should hold a groundbreaking ceremony,\u201d he added.\nThe 180km canal project has received widespread support from the Cambodian people and may be started as soon as the end of the year, according to several government officials. It is estimated that the project will cost $1.7 billion, and take four years to complete.\nSome commentators and critics of the government have linked it to alleged Chinese expansionism, with some even suggesting that it may have a military use.\nHun Sen described linking the canal project to geopolitical issues as \u201cridiculous\u201d. He said the width of the canal is very small, so vessel travelling on it would be an easy target for B40 rocket-propelled grenades.\nHe explained that it was those who were against China that opposed the project.&nbsp;\n\u201cSecurity concerns for Vietnam make no sense at all, as China and Vietnam are friends and Cambodia and Vietnam are friends too. They won\u2019t fight on Cambodian soil,\u201d he said.\n\u201cLet me emphasise that there is no link to China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative. It is purely the initiative of Cambodia. It will support our socio-economic development and political independence through the Kingdom\u2019s infrastructure,\u201d he added.\n\u201cWe must become independent in the transportation sector, and this goes beyond mere socio-economic development,\u201d he continued.\nHe also pointed out that there is no requirement for Cambodia to negotiate with anyone, as the Kingdom follows Article 5 of the 1995 Mekong Agreement, which specifies that only notification is needed for projects which are built on a tributary of the Mekong River.\nHe added that Cambodians had informed Vietnam and Laos of the project out of politeness.\nNiem Chheng\nThe Phnom Penh Post\nAsia News Network\nTAGS\nHun Sen\nimmediate\nSenate\nConstruction\nCambodia\nFunan Techo Canal\nRelated\nThaksin proposes ideas to develop Thailand's Northeastern region\nDecember 20, 2024\nDSI\u2019s case against iCon Group execs ready for prosecution\nDecember 20, 2024\nNew Year festivities expected to net over THB62 billion\nDecember 20, 2024\nMOST VIEWED\n1.\nThaksin proposes ideas to develop Thailand's Northeastern region\n2.\nUncover Sisaket\u2019s creative heart through music at vibrant festival\n3.\nSuriya unveils plans for closer Thailand-China railway link\n4.\nDSI\u2019s case against iCon Group execs ready for prosecution\n5.\nNew Year festivities expected to net over THB62 billion",

The first phase is expected to open in 2028.\nPhase 2 from Nakhon Ratchasima to Nong Khai has passed an environmental impact assessment with construction scheduled to begin next year, he said.\nThis section will link with the Laos-China railway and open in 2030, marking the completion of the project, he said.\nSuriya added that a new Mekong high-speed rail bridge to link Nong Khai and the Laos capital of Vientiane will be constructed using the State Railway of Thailand\u2019s 2024 fiscal budget.\nDuring the meeting, Thailand also proposed the Transport Ministry\u2019s Rail Technology Research and Development Agency as a central agency to facilitate technology and innovation transfer among the three countries.\nThe 32nd meeting of the project\u2019s joint committee will be held in Thailand, with the date yet to be announced.\nTAGS\nChina\nHigh Speed Rail\nLaos\nNong Khai\nNakhon Ratchasima\nBangkok\nTransport Ministry\nState Railway of Thailand\nBreaking News\nRelated\nMalaysia open to extending China-led rail project to Thai border\nMarch 29, 2024\nAirport Rail Link due for big overhaul to ensure passenger safety\nMarch 22, 2024\nWork on light rail transit system in Khon Kaen expected to begin in 2025\nMarch 03, 2024\nMOST VIEWED\n1.\nThaksin proposes ideas to develop Thailand's Northeastern region\n2.\nUncover Sisaket\u2019s creative heart through music at vibrant festival\n3.\nSuriya unveils plans for closer Thailand-China railway link\n4.\nDSI\u2019s case against iCon Group execs ready for prosecution\n5.\nNew Year festivities expected to net over THB62 billion",

        "content": "News\nA highway collapse in China kills 36 people\nTHURSDAY, MAY 02, 2024\nPlay\nA section of a highway collapsed after heavy rains in a mountainous area in southern China, sending cars tumbling down a slope and leaving at least 36 people dead, authorities said Thursday.\nThe\nMeizhou city government\nsaid that 23 vehicles had been found after a 17.9-meter (58.7-foot) long section of the highway gave way about 2 a.m. on Wednesday. Thirty other people had injuries, none of them life-threatening, a government statement said.\nA fire department official told\nChinese\nmedia that the search effort was complicated by steady rain, gravel and soil coming down at the site, posing some risk to the workers.\nThe report said that rescue teams divided the area into 10 grids and searched with dogs and life-detecting devices. Excavators and cranes were also brought in to help.\nThe collapse left a barren scar down a steep slope in an otherwise verdant green forested area. Witnesses told local media they heard a loud noise and saw a wide hole open up behind them after driving past the section just before it collapsed.\nVideo and photos in local media showed smoke and fire at the scene, with a highway guardrail leaning down into the flames. A pile of blackened cars could be seen on the slope leading down from the highway.\nA photo later showed a construction crane lowering a mangled car to the road surface, near three other similarly wrecked vehicles. All appeared to have been burned out.\nOver 56 centimetres (22 inches) of rain has fallen in the past four weeks in the county where the roadway collapsed, more than four times as much as last year. Some villages in Meizhou flooded in early April, and the city has seen heavy rain in recent days.\nParts of\nGuangdong\nprovince have seen&nbsp;record rains and flooding&nbsp;in the past two weeks, as well as hail. A&nbsp;tornado killed five people&nbsp;in\nGuangzhou\n, the provincial capital, last weekend.\nHeavy rain and flooding pose a special risk to mountain roadways and highway bridges because of erosion, debris flows and landslides. China has massively expanded its infrastructure in recent years, adding more than 1 million highway bridges, the world\u2019s largest network of high-speed trains and scores of new airports.\nIn the rush to build, flaws in design and construction methods have frequently come to light, while regular inspections and maintenance are sometimes given short shrift. Dozens have died in recent years in tunnel collapses and floods, including 14 who drowned in subway trains in the central city of\nZhengzhou\nduring massive flooding that killed around 300 people.\nSubsequent reports said the system had not been prevented with adequate and other equipment and that officials failed to suspend service as they should have under government directives.\nChina\u2019s overseas projects such as roads and dams under the Belt and Road Initiative have also been criticized for design problems and poor quality, potentially posing a challenge to its efforts to build its influence in the developing world.\nAP\nTAGS\nChina\nflooding\nheavy rain\nhighway\ncollapse\nRelated\nThaksin proposes ideas to develop Thailand's Northeastern region\nDecember 20, 2024\nDSI\u2019s case against iCon Group execs ready for prosecution\nDecember 20, 2024\nNew Year festivities expected to net over THB62 billion\nDecember 20, 2024\nMOST VIEWED\n1.\nThaksin proposes ideas to develop Thailand's Northeastern region\n2.\nUncover Sisaket\u2019s creative heart through music at vibrant festival\n3.\nSuriya unveils plans for closer Thailand-China railway link\n4.\nDSI\u2019s case against iCon Group execs ready for prosecution\n5.\nNew Year festivities expected to net over THB62 billion",

Promoting people-to-people connectivity through cultural exchange is also an important part of international cooperation in the construction of the Belt and Road. This Thangka exhibition takes this opportunity to build a platform for cultural exchange and cooperation between China and Thailand with the beauty of cultural art, emphasizing the important role of Thangka art as a treasure of traditional Chinese painting in enhancing cultural exchange and cooperation among Belt and Road countries.\nQue Xiaohua states that enhancing cultural exchanges is an important way to build a community of shared future for mankind. As one of the important forms of traditional Chinese painting, Thangka demonstrates the rich connotations of ancient Chinese painting techniques and religious culture, allowing the people of Thailand to gain a deeper understanding of Chinese traditional culture. This deepens the cultural exchanges and understanding between China and Thailand and promotes the development of China-Thailand relations in a broader field.\nIn recent years, China and Thailand have used the concepts of \"China and Thailand as one family\" and \"Heart to Heart Connection\" as important foundations. Together, they promote the high-quality joint construction of the \"Belt and Road Initiative\" and jointly build a China-Thailand community of shared destiny.\nBoth Thailand and China are deeply influenced by Buddhism. Thai Buddhism and Chinese Buddhism are like two rivers originating from the same source, each flowing vigorously and carrying knowledge and insights of compassion and wisdom. Chinese Thangka painting, a long-standing art form and part of both China's and the world's intangible cultural heritage showcase Tibetan culture with its meticulous brushwork, vibrant colors, and profound thematic content, bearing deep historical and cultural significance.\nTibetan Buddhism is one of the systems of Chinese Buddhism. In the latter half of the 8th century, Guru Padmasambhava introduced Buddhism to Xizang, officially starting the spread of Buddhism in the region. This exhibition selectively displays 40 classic works from the \"Thousand Thangkas of Master Padmasambhava\" project, showcasing the legendary stories of Guru Padmasambhava, a principal founder of Tibetan Buddhism, in various locations at the foothills of the Himalayas, from China to Nepal, to ancient India, including today's Thailand. Each Thangka carries rich historical and cultural significance, displaying the unique characteristics of countries along the \"Belt and Road.\" This exhibition marks the first overseas public presentation of the \"Thousand Thangkas of Master Padmasambhava\" project.\nThe event also features an interactive area for Thangka painting experiences. Guests participate in tracing Thangkas, experiencing the art of colouring and gilding in the Thangka painting process and discovering the charm of this ancient art. The event also provides Thangka souvenirs and simulated Thangka gifts for the guests, who eagerly take photos to commemorate their visits.\nChina Daily\nAsia News Network\nTAGS\nChina\nCULTURE\nThailand\nExhibition\nBelt and Road\nlandscapes\nRelated\nUncover Sisaket\u2019s creative heart through music at vibrant festival\nDecember 20, 2024\nThailand's man-made destinations: A new frontier for tourism\nDecember 19, 2024\nChiang Mai unveils glory of old Lanna Kingdom at Wiang Kum Kam\nDecember 19, 2024\nMOST VIEWED\n1.\nThaksin proposes ideas to develop Thailand's Northeastern region\n2.\nUncover Sisaket\u2019s creative heart through music at vibrant festival\n3.\nSuriya unveils plans for closer Thailand-China railway link\n4.\nDSI\u2019s case against iCon Group execs ready for prosecution\n5.\nNew Year festivities expected to net over THB62 billion",

        "content": "World\nKazakhstan foreign minister\u2019s visit to open new chapter in bilateral ties\nTHURSDAY, APRIL 18, 2024\nPlay\nAs the world navigates through complex geopolitical landscapes, diplomatic engagements hold the key to fostering mutual understanding and cooperation among nations. Kazakhstan, often referred to as the \"Heart of Eurasia\u201d, stands out as an example of diplomatic pragmatism and proactive engagement on the global stage.\nWith the upcoming visit of Murat Nurtleu, the Deputy Prime Minister - Minister of Foreign Affairs of Kazakhstan, to Thailand on April 23, a new chapter unfolds in the bilateral relations between the two nations, promising to deepen ties and unlock opportunities for mutual benefit.\nKazakhstan's foreign policy, characterised by its multi-vector approach, has long been focused on building strong partnerships across diverse sectors. The nation's commitment to multilateral diplomacy is evident through its active involvement in international organizations, where it champions cooperation and peace-building efforts. Currently presiding over six reputable international organizations, Kazakhstan plays a significant role in shaping global agendas and fostering dialogue among nations.\nMoreover, Kazakhstan's humanitarian efforts underscore its commitment to global welfare. With a substantial allocation of US$600 million for humanitarian and development assistance through the Kazakhstan International Development Agency (KazAID), Kazakhstan demonstrates its dedication to supporting international communities in need.\nIn internal policy, Kazakhstan has undergone large-scale democratic transformations and made significant progress towards protecting human rights in full compliance with its international commitments. Significant changes have been made to the legislation on democratic participation, human rights protection, and the rule of law. One of the latest events that took place in Kazakhstan was the Laws signed on April 11 by President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev. They significantly strengthen the protection of the rights of women and children.\nIn the economic realm, Kazakhstan's pursuit of advanced technologies and robust business partnerships reflects its vision for sustainable development. Strengthening ties with the main global powers in critical sectors, such as renewable energy, showcases Kazakhstan's determination to diversify its economy and foster innovation.\nAgainst this backdrop of diplomatic prowess and economic dynamism, the visit of Foreign Minister Nurtleu to Thailand holds immense significance. The bilateral relations between Kazakhstan and Thailand over three decades have been progressing steadily, driven by mutual respect and a shared vision for regional stability. Thailand's traditional support for Kazakhstan's initiatives on multilateral platforms underscores the alignment of their diplomatic priorities.\nOne pivotal aspect of the burgeoning Kazakhstan-Thailand relationship is the tourism sector. In 2023, the number of Kazakhstani tourists visiting Thailand reached a record high, reflecting the growing cultural exchange and people-to-people ties between the two nations. The temporary visa-free regime provided by the governments of both countries has played a crucial role in facilitating this increase, showcasing the mutual goodwill.\nAdditionally, bilateral trade between Kazakhstan and Thailand has witnessed positive growth, reaching a record US$367 million by the end of 2023. The upcoming visit of Foreign Minister Nurtleu not only underscores Kazakhstan's commitment to enhancing economic cooperation with Thailand but also presents an opportunity to further bridge the trade gap and tap into Thailand's vibrant economic potential.\nFurthermore, Kazakhstan's strategic position as a pivotal trade and logistics hub in Eurasia aligns with Thailand's aspirations for regional connectivity and economic integration. Kazakhstan's involvement in key initiatives, such as China's Belt and Road Initiative and the EU Global Gate Project, positions it as a crucial partner for Thailand in realizing the shared objectives of economic prosperity and connectivity.\nIn conclusion, as Foreign Minister Nurtleu prepares to embark on his visit to Thailand, the stage is set for a new chapter of collaboration and partnership between Kazakhstan and Thailand. Through diplomatic dialogue, economic cooperation, and people-to-people exchanges, both nations stand to reap the benefits of a strengthened relationship that transcends geographical boundaries and fosters mutual growth and prosperity.\nTAGS\nKazakhstan\ndiplomatic relations\nembassy\nMinistry of Foreign Affairs\nRelated\nThailand set to strengthen economic ties with Kazakhstan through new MoU\nFebruary 26, 2024\nTAT upbeat about projected 220,000 arrivals by Kazakhstani tourists\nFebruary 28, 2024\nAlternative ways of the Asian goods shipment to Europe\nDecember 07, 2023\nMOST VIEWED\n1.\nThaksin proposes ideas to develop Thailand's Northeastern region\n2.\nUncover Sisaket\u2019s creative heart through music at vibrant festival\n3.\nSuriya unveils plans for closer Thailand-China railway link\n4.\nDSI\u2019s case against iCon Group execs ready for prosecution\n5.\nNew Year festivities expected to net over THB62 billion",

It is Thailand\u2019s first standard-gauge high-speed railway project.\nIn April last year, a freight train carrying durians in 25 refrigerated containers arrived in South China\u2019s Guangdong province, completing its first heavily loaded return trip by rail through Thailand, Laos and China. The train took five days to reach Guangzhou, the provincial capital, from Map Ta Phut in Rayong, Thailand. The transportation time by train was at least a week faster than by ship.\nUpon completion, the China-Thailand Railway will be connected to the China-Laos Railway, forming a railroad artery across the Indochina Peninsula and elevating infrastructure connectivity in Southeast Asia.\nPitiwat Angsuviriya, a mechanical engineering student from Thailand\u2019s Khon Kaen University who is currently participating in a study program at Southwest Jiaotong University in Sichuan province, said he found Xi\u2019s visit very inspiring.\n\u201cPresident Xi\u2019s visit to Thailand impresses me even today, given that the trip was made at a time when the whole world had just recovered from the COVID-19 pandemic. It\u2019s encouraging that leaders from the APEC member economies gathered in Thailand and joined efforts to further common interests,\u201d he said.\nAbout two months after Xi\u2019s visit, China announced the resumption of group tour services that were suspended due to the pandemic, and Pitiwat was able to enrol in a one-year railway talent training program along with 18 other Thai students.\nAfter finishing the training, they will return to Thailand and apply their knowledge to the development of their country\u2019s railway network.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good opportunity for me to study a high-speed train engineering course in China. Economic growth relies on connectivity and transportation. High-speed rail is therefore considered a very good option for the development of Southeast Asia\u2019s economy,\u201d Pitiwat said.\nHe added that the course will help him build a career and advance the high-speed railway network under the Belt and Road Initiative, which in turn will allow the regional economy to play a bigger role on the global stage.\nXi\u2019s visit to Thailand in 2022 was his first trip to the country as Chinese president. The visit left a lasting impression on local residents who still remember the messages of friendship flashed on giant LED screens dotting the way to the hotel where Xi stayed.\n\u201cI clearly remember the screens along the road that his convoy took. They said \u2018China and Thailand are a family\u2019 in both Chinese and Thai languages,\u201d said Nut, a taxi driver in Bangkok. \u201cEverywhere the convoy went, it was greeted with warmth and friendliness.\u201d\nThat China and Thailand are a family has been further illustrated after the two countries signed a mutual visa exemption agreement early this year.\nThe Association of Thai Travel Agents estimates that the visa-free policy will help maintain more than 20,000 visits per day by Chinese tourists, which will help Thailand meet the target of welcoming 40 million foreign tourists this year, generating around 2.3 trillion baht (US$62.5 billion) in revenue.\nSisdivachr Cheewarattanaporn, president of the travel agents\u2019 association, said the visa exemption is expected to boost Thai tourist visits to China by 18 to 20 %. \u201cDiversified Chinese cultural activities in summer and winter, such as the Harbin International Ice and Snow Festival, are a big draw for Thai people,\u201d he added.\nIn his opening remarks during the 29th APEC Economic Leaders\u2019 Meeting, Xi emphasized that countries in the Asia-Pacific region should stay committed to openness and inclusiveness, build an Asia-Pacific community with a shared future, and strive for an Asia-Pacific region that is peaceful and stable as well as clean and beautiful, bringing about common prosperity through mutual help and care.\nHistory has proved time and again that only openness, inclusiveness and win-win cooperation can pave the right way forward for humanity, Xi said.\nPinit Jarusombat, president of the Thai-Chinese Cultural Relationship Council, said the mutual visa exemption measure is a concrete action to practice China\u2019s commitment to openness.\n\u201cThailand and China are as close as brothers and share a lot in common, especially in terms of culture. The visa policy will boost exchanges among the general public and further deepen understanding between people,\u201d he said.\nAs China and Thailand continue to strengthen infrastructure connectivity and further boost people-to-people exchanges, bilateral trade and cooperation in other fields have also entered the fast lane.\nLast year, the trade volume between the two countries reached $126.3 billion, according to the Chinese embassy in Thailand. China is Thailand\u2019s largest trading partner, accounting for 22 %&nbsp;of its total foreign trade.\nThai durian, one of Thailand\u2019s most popular fruits, is currently a hit among Chinese families. Durian exports to China surged 81.7 %&nbsp;to a record 90 billion baht last year, according to the Thai Department of Foreign Trade.\nShipments to China accounted for 70 %&nbsp;of Thailand\u2019s total durian exports in 2023, and the number is expected to grow this year, thanks to improved transportation.\nWichai Kinchong Choi, senior vice-president of Kasikornbank, one of Thailand\u2019s leading banks, said that logistics is among the major issues for Thailand, a country that makes more than 60 %&nbsp;of its GDP from exports, especially international trade in agricultural products.\n\u201cPresident Xi stressed that countries should follow the spirit of the Asia-Pacific family, look after one another like passengers in the same boat, and steadily move toward an Asia-Pacific community with a shared future. China always practices what it advocates,\u201d he said.\nWichai said that Thailand has been supporting the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative and has benefited a lot from China\u2019s investment.\nMoreover, China\u2019s openness in organizing several big trade fairs, ever since the country optimized COVID-19 control measures last year, has provided great opportunities to other developing countries to speed up their own economic recovery, he added.\nDuring his visit to Bangkok in 2022, Xi also called for efforts to drive green and low-carbon development and ensure a clean and beautiful Asia-Pacific region. He promised that China would provide support for the implementation of the Bangkok Goals on Bio-Circular-Green Economy.\nWichai said that Chinese electric vehicle brands are now very popular among Thai people, especially the young generation. \u201cWith China\u2019s support, Thailand is accelerating its progress toward the country\u2019s green development goal, and aims to become Southeast Asia\u2019s EV hub and logistics centre,\u201d he said.\nAs Xi noted that APEC economies have jointly sown the seed of the Putrajaya Vision of an open, dynamic, resilient and peaceful Asia-Pacific community by 2040, it is time to cultivate, nurture and foster the blossoming flower of common development in the region, Wichai said.\n\u201cChina is taking the lead in joining hands with the Asia-Pacific community, aiming for common development of the whole region,\u201d he added.\nYang Wanli\nChina Daily\nAsia News Network\nTAGS\nSino-Thai\nSino-Thai railway\ncooperation\nChina\nThailand\nFast track\nBullet Train\nXi Jinping\nAPEC\nRelated\nAmulets: Thai soft power, exported as far as China\nApril 21, 2024\nCeremony marks 30th anniversary of 1st Thai-Lao Friendship Bridge\nApril 21, 2024\nPirapan says Energy Ministry working on new oil price structure\nApril 21, 2024\nMOST VIEWED\n1.\nThaksin proposes ideas to develop Thailand's Northeastern region\n2.\nUncover Sisaket\u2019s creative heart through music at vibrant festival\n3.\nSuriya unveils plans for closer Thailand-China railway link\n4.\nDSI\u2019s case against iCon Group execs ready for prosecution\n5.\nNew Year festivities expected to net over THB62 billion",

        "content": "World\nPrabowo's China policy: Analysts foresee pragmatism prevailing over nationalism\nFRIDAY, FEBRUARY 16, 2024\nPlay\nDuring the 2019 Indonesian presidential election, Prabowo Subianto \u2013 who was then running against incumbent Joko Widodo pledged to review Chinese investments in the country if he won.\nYet after he was appointed defence minister later that year, Prabowo was criticised for being too soft on China. At that time, dozens of Chinese fishing vessels&nbsp;encroached into Indonesia\u2019s exclusive economic zone in the Natuna Sea&nbsp;a territory also claimed by China.\nPrabowo had called for handling the situation in a \u201crelaxed\u201d manner, adding that \u201cChina is a friendly nation\u201d. This drew criticism from his former political allies, even as Indonesia sent warships and fighter jets to the area. Defence ties were later strengthened when he met his Chinese counterparts on multiple visits, most recently in 2023.\nWill Prabowo, who has&nbsp;claimed victory following the Feb 14 presidential election&nbsp;with around 60% of the vote based on unofficial quick counts, take a stronger and more nationalistic stance towards China, or strike a more conciliatory tone in favour of flourishing economic ties?\nAnalysts said Prabowo, 72, is expected to continue with the economic and foreign policies of Widodo, popularly known as Jokowi. The latter\u2019s tacit endorsement of his former political rival played a key role in securing Prabowo\u2019s election victory.\nFormer Indonesian ambassador to China Sugeng Rahardjo told The Straits Times that he expects relations between Indonesia and China to continue to strengthen, based on the \u201cstrong foundation\u201d established over the past 10 years by Widodo, who has good personal relations with Chinese President Xi Jinping.\nHe noted that Mr Prabowo and his running mate, Widodo\u2019s son Gibran Rakabuming Raka, have emphasised during their campaign that they will continue policies implemented by Mr Widodo, who remains President until Oct 20.\nThe General Elections Commission has said official results are expected to be released by March 20 at the latest.&nbsp;&nbsp;\nIndonesia-China economic ties have soared under Mr Widodo\u2019s 10-year tenure. China is now Indonesia\u2019s top trading partner, with trade valued at more than US$130 billion (S$175 billion) annually in 2022 nearly double the amount in 2014.\nChina was also Indonesia\u2019s second-largest investor in 2022 at US$8.2 billion, behind Singapore at US$13.3 billion.\nA centrepiece of the partnership is the US$7.2 billion&nbsp;high-speed railway connecting the capital Jakarta to nearby Bandung&nbsp;that began operations in October 2023. It was a signature project under China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative and was built by a consortium involving China Railway International.\nAnalysts believe that China\u2019s economic importance to Indonesia will weigh heavily in Prabowo\u2019s calculus and that his approach towards the world\u2019s second-largest economy will be guided more by pragmatism than nationalism.\nMuhammad Zulfikar Rakhmat, a researcher at Indonesia\u2019s Centre of Economic and Law Studies who studies China-Indonesia relations, said: \u201cI think Prabowo will see China as an important partner, and I think he will strive to continue establishing stronger cooperation between Indonesia and China.\u201d\n\u201cWhoever wins the election will remain close to China no matter what, because China is a very important partner for Indonesia, especially in terms of the economy. Most of our development funding and infrastructure investment comes from China,\u201d he added.\nBut even if Prabowo takes a pragmatic approach towards China, he might have to contend with nationalistic pressures from the Indonesian public on potentially thorny bilateral issues.\nRakhmat highlighted issues that could cause friction with Beijing if they come under domestic pressure.\nOther than the Natuna Sea territorial dispute, there is also Indonesia\u2019s support in the United Nations for China\u2019s policies towards Uighur minorities in Xinjiang, which has drawn some domestic backlash.\nIn 2022, Indonesia voted against a resolution tabled by the US to debate China\u2019s alleged human rights abuses against the Uighurs in the UN human rights body. At that time, Indonesia said it did not want to politicise the UN council.\nAnother potentially thorny bilateral issue is Chinese companies\u2019 involvement in Indonesia\u2019s nickel mining industry, which has caused environmental damage.\nFor better or worse, Mr Prabowo\u2019s less-than-predictable personality will affect Indonesia\u2019s foreign policy.\nAt the Shangri-La Dialogue high-level security forum in June 2023, the former army general ruffled feathers at home and abroad when he&nbsp;suggested creating a new demilitarized zone&nbsp;15km between Ukraine\u2019s and Russia\u2019s forward positions and letting the people in \u201cdisputed\u201d areas decide their fate through a UN referendum.\nThe Indonesian Foreign Ministry was reportedly caught off guard by the proposal, which would allow Russian forces control over eastern Ukraine territory occupied since the&nbsp;February 2022 invasion.&nbsp;The plan was rejected out of hand by Ukraine, although Chinese delegates had reportedly welcomed Mr Prabowo\u2019s proposal.\nOften described as hot-tempered, Prabowo lashed out at journalists during his 2014 bid for the presidency, criticising them for being \u201ccruel\u201d and \u201cnot balanced\u201d in their coverage of him.\nWhile there are signs that Prabowo might be unpredictable, he is likely to continue Indonesia\u2019s basic foreign policy stance, focusing on regional autonomy and not siding with either the United States or China, said Associate Professor Kei Koga from the Public Policy and Global Affairs programme at Nanyang Technological University.\nRegarding the Natuna Sea dispute, Prof Koga believes Prabowo would take a wait-and-see position in terms of Beijing\u2019s posture, although he added that the risk of an escalation remains.\nLeo Suryadinata, a visiting senior fellow at the ISEAS Yusof Ishak Institute, believes that open conflict is unlikely as long as China does not start agitating Indonesia in the Natuna Sea. \u201cI believe Beijing knows this.\u201d\nChinese state media reports on Prabowo\u2019s projected victory have struck a positive tone, highlighting the economic and trade gains, as well as Belt and Road Initiative projects, under Widodo\u2019s term.\nThey also noted that all three presidential election candidates had posted Chinese New Year wishes on social media, travelled to Chinatown and said little to stir up anti-Chinese sentiment during the 75-day campaign period.\nLeo said Indonesia wants to be regarded as an independent actor rather than a follower. \u201cPrabowo would make sure that Indonesian territorial integrity would not be harmed, but would not follow either the US or China. He is not likely to get involved in US-China competition.\u201d\nLim Min Zhang&nbsp;\nJoyce ZK Lim\nThe Straits Times\nAsia News Network\nTAGS\nPrabowo Subianto\nChina\nnationalism\nBeijing\nSingapore\nJoko Widodo\nUS-China\nRelated\nWill 6-day workweek for executives help Samsung avert crisis?\nApril 21, 2024\nMassive river flooding expected in China's Guangdong, threatening millions\nApril 21, 2024\nMyanmar general killed in drone attack near Thai border\nApril 21, 2024\nMOST VIEWED\n1.\nThaksin proposes ideas to develop Thailand's Northeastern region\n2.\nUncover Sisaket\u2019s creative heart through music at vibrant festival\n3.\nSuriya unveils plans for closer Thailand-China railway link\n4.\nDSI\u2019s case against iCon Group execs ready for prosecution\n5.\nNew Year festivities expected to net over THB62 billion",

        "content": "More\nLand bridge: a great opportunity for Thailand or another dream project?\nMONDAY, DECEMBER 25, 2023\n|\nNongluck Ajanapanya\nPlay\nAmong several projects that Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin's government is pushing to attract foreign investors is the land bridge, an ambitious undertaking that would link the Andaman Sea to the Gulf of Thailand and provide thousands of positive opportunities and benefits.\nBut while the government has worked tirelessly to convince the world of the viability of this megaproject, the response has been vague and wary.\nPotential investors, particularly in such major economic countries as the US, China, and Germany, have expressed their appreciation while maintaining an interest in investing, positions that seem to reflect their scepticism about whether this megaproject will be a great profitable opportunity for all parties or just another effort by the Thai government to impress investors worldwide before fading away like some previous projects.\nTheir suspicions may be exaggerated, but they have reasons to be reluctant.\nWhat is the land bridge and why now?\nThailand's cabinet gave the green light to build a land bridge from the Gulf of Thailand to the Andaman Sea as a route for international trade on October 16.\nDuring a special talk on the topic at the \u201cThan Talk\u201d forum on December 20, Chayatham Promsorn, permanent secretary of the Transport Ministry, noted that this megaproject would undoubtedly save costs and time, thus improving trade flow.\nHe added that the megaproject will create a new link between the Pacific and Indian oceans, relieving shipping congestion in the Malacca Straits, which is currently the main regional trade route for cargo.\nAcknowledging that this was not Thailand's first mention of the land bridge project, he pointed out that the time had come for it to become a reality, as the number of freighters and cargos passing through the Malacca Straits is expected to increase to 122,000 per year by 2030.\nGiven the already congested overcapacity, building another optional transit mode like the land bridge in this region is very interesting.\nChayatham went on to emphasise three key success factors for the project. First, it should be considered as a business model plan rather than infrastructure development because the operational period is crucial. The second step is to manage the land bridge as a \u201cOne Port Two Sides\u201d operation with a complete land-link connection. The third option is to invest and operate as a consortium with a single operator.\nPrime Minister Srettha Thavisin previously noted in an article published on December 17 in Nikkei Asia that the project would include the construction of deep-sea ports at Ranong on Thailand's Andaman coast and Chumphon on the Gulf of Thailand.\nHe said the two ports will operate under a \"one port, two sides\" concept, supported by a motorway and dual-track railway lines connecting the ports to each other and to the country's national network.\n\"Once completed, the land bridge is expected to reduce travel time between the Indian and Pacific Oceans by an average of four days and transportation costs by 15%. For a company shipping goods from Chennai to Yokohama, for example, this could mean a shorter transit time and a 4% cost savings,\" he explained.\nThe first phase of construction is scheduled to begin in September 2025 and last until October 2030. Contractors will most likely be invited to bid on the project between April and June 2025.\nHe expected that land bridge would benefit Thailand's economy by 1.3 trillion baht and boost the country's annual GDP growth rate by 1.5% due to increased export opportunities and the creation of 280,000 jobs. It will also create new development opportunities in other provinces in southern Thailand.\nIs the project worth investing in?\nAccording to the pitches made by the Thai government to international investors thus far, this land bridge project appears to be both appealing and investible.\nHowever, many still doubt the possibility of its becoming a reality while others see difficulties and a few are already shaking their heads.\nPiset Rittapirom, chairman of the Bangkok Shipowners and Agents Association, said at the Than Talk forum that the land bridge project is a mission impossible.\nAlthough he is impressed by the government's and other parties' efforts and bravery in creating such an ambitious project, he believes the land bridge will never be built.\nAs a shipping operator, he pointed out that changing a shipping route plan is not simple as making a simple switch.\nHe explained that shippers consider several factors when determining ship routes, including product volume, space utilisation, carrier sizing, revenues, container flow, port management, and energy efficiency.\nMaking the decision to dock at one port implies that the port can assist carriers in unloading and reloading product in large quantities thus saving time, money and energy.\nThat means that, in addition to a land bridge, Thailand must have an efficient logistics network and management system.\nUnfortunately, the country's current ports and logistics network are still in disarray and inefficient, and it is still a long way from meeting new global green standards.\nBesides, Thailand's transshipment laws and regulations are out of date, making it more difficult for shippers to operate in the country.\nChanging the shipping route would require a time saving of more than 7 days. So, the government\u2019s promise of saving five days is irrelevant to major shippers around the world.\nAlso, while all large shipping companies and port operators are transforming to be more environmentally friendly, Thailand's logistic ecosystem still has many more issues to address in order to meet global green standards.\nPiset cited as examples electronic trucks, charging stations, and other facilities to support new hydrogen engine carriers, which are currently unavailable in Thailand's port and logistics.\nRather than focusing on land bridges, he believes the country should prioritise improving logistics management to alleviate crowded land logistics issues, which play critical roles in connecting ports and businesses.\nHe explained that transferring cargo from a freighter docked at Laem Chabang, the country's main deep-sea port, currently takes at least a day.\nGiven that docking fees average around $100,000 per day, it should only take a few hours or less.\nHe insisted that Thailand should prioritise inland logistics improvements right now to achieve the country's goal of becoming ASEAN's logistics hub.\nHis viewpoint is shared by some international analysts.\nLu Xiang, a senior researcher with the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, a Beijing-focused government think tank, told CTN news on November 27 that China is taking a cautious approach to the land bridge because it is not a high-profile strategic project.\nHe concluded that offloading and reloading was not a viable solution due to the complexity and potential lack of cost savings.\nHowever, Lu said Chinese firms may evaluate their options independently and discuss them with their Thai counterparts.\nWhile China may have mixed feelings, it will not object if Thai firms do business with Chinese firms, he added.\nZhu Feng, dean of Nanjing University's Institute of International Relations, is concerned that the project\u2019s fate is in the hands of the Thai government and subject to changes in political dynamics.\nHe anticipated that once the project began, Chinese corporations would play an important role as contractors, but that China would not provide funding.\nHe then noted that there will be fewer state-led investments to build megaprojects overseas, and the Belt and Road initiative will focus on logical business decisions based on investment returns for the next decade.\nMeanwhile, DW, a German news outlet, reported that Ernst Wolfgang Reichel, the new German ambassador in Bangkok, reportedly told Thai government officials in November that he would lobby German companies to invest in the project.\nHowever, it remains to be seen whether German companies, such as Siemens, which helped build parts of Bangkok's rail system, would be interested in investing in such a scheme.\nThe report also cited a German diplomatic source who asked not to be named because they were not authorised to speak about the matter. He said if German companies were to invest in the scheme, they would most likely focus on port development, but added that German participation would most likely be \"limited\".\nMark Cogan, a Thailand expert at Japan's Kansai Gaidai University, noted in this DW report published on November 21 that another major stumbling block for European investors could be the project\u2019s environmental and social implications, which have not been fully assessed.\nHe pointed out that the immediate challenge for Srettha is to demonstrate that the land bridge will not only be profitable, but will also not increase carbon emissions.\nGiven the scepticism, the Thai government will have a lot of work to do to dispel those doubts and ensure that the land bridge project is fully accepted.\nNonetheless PM Srettha remains confident that the project will strengthen regional supply chains while capitalising on ASEAN's potential as a logistics hub.\nHe noted that, following Asia's experience with the pandemic, improving supply chain resilience has become a goal in and of itself, and that the land bridge can ensure benefits for all parties involved.\nThe land bridge will also help to resolve issues with existing shipping routes, as well as provide a faster and safer option for transportation and trade at a lower cost and with environmental considerations, he added.\nOnly time will tell whether the land bridge will ever achieve the image envisioned by the Thai government.\nTAGS\nThailand\nland bridge\neconomy\ninvestment\nSrettha Thavisin\nRelated\nThai economy poised for growth in 2024, fueled by tourism and export\nDecember 18, 2023\nSuvarnabhumi Airport in 2023: A year of take-offs \u2013 and turbulence\nDecember 17, 2023\nCrimes and shadows flourish among social media\nDecember 23, 2023\nMOST VIEWED\n1.\nThaksin proposes ideas to develop Thailand's Northeastern region\n2.\nUncover Sisaket\u2019s creative heart through music at vibrant festival\n3.\nSuriya unveils plans for closer Thailand-China railway link\n4.\nDSI\u2019s case against iCon Group execs ready for prosecution\n5.\nNew Year festivities expected to net over THB62 billion",

        "content": "World\nAlternative ways of the Asian goods shipment to Europe\nTHURSDAY, DECEMBER 07, 2023\nPlay\nSea transits serve as the lifeblood of global trade, acting as the vital conduits connecting nations and facilitating the seamless movement of goods and resources worldwide. Yet, beneath the surface of their undeniable importance lies a complex tapestry of challenges and concerns that reverberate throughout the global transportation network. These challenges, rooted in a variety of factors, can disrupt trade routes, causing disruptions that span from mere hours to several years.\nMarch 2021 bore witness to a stark reminder of the vulnerability of global trade when a single transport ship blocked the Suez Canal for an entire week. This incident sent shockwaves through the global trade community, with more than 400 vessels trapped in a traffic jam within a waterway responsible for approximately 12% of all global trade. The repercussions were immediate and far-reaching \u2013 delivery schedules were extended, fuel prices soared worldwide, and trade participants incurred losses amounting to billions of dollars. The incident underscored the fragility of supply chains worldwide, casting a long shadow on the trajectory of global trade and raising concerns about potential reductions in its growth.\nFor nations like Thailand, the imperative of maintaining a robust network for delivering goods is paramount. The impending conclusion of a Free Trade Agreement with the European Union by 2025 has heightened the urgency for establishing alternative routes that ensure the efficient delivery of goods from Asia to Europe. However, the contemporary international landscape is marred by tension and direct military clashes between certain countries, casting a shadow of uncertainty over established trade routes.\nAmid these challenges, the current geopolitical environment demands the exploration of innovative approaches to intensify international trade. The spotlight turns to Kazakhstan, a nation emerging as a pivotal player in the reshaping of international trade routes. Kazakhstan plays an increasingly crucial role as a regional transport and logistics hub, bridging the Eurasian continent with the Asia-Pacific region.\nAs the world's largest landlocked country and sharing extensive borders with Russia and China, Kazakhstan accounts for approximately 85% of all land transit traffic from China to Europe. Recognizing the strategic importance of the transit transport industry, Kazakhstan has invested about $30 billion in its transport and logistics infrastructure over the past decade. The nation boasts 13 international transport corridors, including five railways and eight roads. Notably, the \"Western Europe \u2013 Western China\" transit road corridor offers the capability to deliver goods to Europe within a mere 10-12 days.\nIn 2022, Kazakhstan witnessed a significant upswing in transit volume, reaching 23.2 million tons of cargo \u2013 a 10% increase compared to the previous year. Through strategic measures to eliminate bottlenecks, transit times for goods along the Trans-Caspian International Transport Route are expected to decrease dramatically, from 38-53 days to just 14-18 days. Within Kazakhstan's borders, transit times will reduce from 12 to 5 days.\nKazakhstan, in partnership with Trans-Caspian International Transport Route (TITR) partners, continues to work towards the development of the Middle Corridor. Since 2017, the International TMTM Association has been actively operating, with participation of Kazakhstan, China, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Turkey, Romania, Poland, and Bulgaria. In a significant milestone achieved in November 2022, Kazakhstan, together with Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Turkey, signed a Roadmap aimed at synchronously eliminating transportation bottlenecks. The objective is to increase the throughput of TMTM from 6 to 10 million tons per year by 2027.\nThe construction of Kazakh terminals in Xi'an, China, and the Black Sea port of Poti in Georgia is in full swing. There are plans to build a third railway checkpoint at the Kazakh-Chinese border, establish \"dry ports,\" create container hubs, and develop other critical infrastructure facilities. These endeavors are expected to significantly bolster transit volumes through Kazakhstan, potentially reaching 35 million tons by 2030.\nMoody's, a renowned credit rating agency, notes that within the context of the evolving Trans-Caspian International Transport Route, which is gaining prominence as an alternative trade route between China and the European Union, new opportunities are opening up for Kazakhstan. Analysts predict favorable economic prospects for the nation.\nKazakhstan's economic program underscores the positive assessments by experts. Astana, the capital of Kazakhstan, has set an ambitious goal of doubling the nation's economy to $450 billion by 2029. To achieve this vision, the government aims to attract at least $150 billion in foreign investment during this period. Remarkably, in 2022, Kazakhstan achieved a significant milestone by attracting a record-breaking $28 billion in foreign direct investment over the last decade. These investments were primarily directed toward key sectors such as the mining and metallurgical complex, manufacturing industry, trade, transport, and the financial sector.\nKazakhstan's strategic advantages extend to its access to diverse markets. These include the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU), a common market comprising Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Russia, with a combined consumer base of 180 million. Kazakhstan also enjoys proximity to western China, home to 300 million consumers, and other Central Asian countries representing an additional 50 million consumers. The absence of significant geopolitical disputes with Western nations positions Kazakhstan as a reliable and predictable partner, uniquely poised to connect Europe and Asia. This positioning bodes well for Kazakhstan's goal of expanding trade turnover. In the first half of 2023, Kazakhstan has already witnessed tangible results, with exports of Kazakh goods to EAEU countries surging by 36.8%. Likewise, trade turnover between Kazakhstan and China from January to August 2023 exhibited substantial growth, reaching $19.0 billion, marking a notable 22.6% increase.\nIn today's dynamic geopolitical landscape, the Belt and Road initiative has emerged as a sought-after international project and a major platform for cooperation. However, rivalries and conflicts around the world can impact sea transits, leading to trade sanctions, embargoes, and restrictions on vessel movements that disrupt global supply chains.\nAs the world continues to seek efficient and sustainable transportation routes, the route through Kazakhstan is likely to gain further prominence. The synergy of road, rail, and maritime transportation, along with the cooperation of multiple nations, underscores the interconnectedness of our world and the innovation of the logistics industry.\nKazakhstan's pivotal role as a regional transport and logistics hub offers a promising path forward for global trade, reaffirming its position as a bridge between Europe and Asia. As the nation continues to invest in infrastructure and foster international partnerships, Kazakhstan is poised to contribute significantly to the evolution of global trade dynamics in the years to come.\nTAGS\nAsian\nEurope\nKazakhstan\nshipment\nTransport\nInternational Trade\nBreaking News\nRelated\nKazakhstan and Thailand mark three decades of ties with tree planting\nJanuary 12, 2023\nThai tourism targets high-spending travellers from Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan\nOctober 04, 2022\nChinese President visit Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan\nSeptember 15, 2022\nMOST VIEWED\n1.\nThaksin proposes ideas to develop Thailand's Northeastern region\n2.\nUncover Sisaket\u2019s creative heart through music at vibrant festival\n3.\nSuriya unveils plans for closer Thailand-China railway link\n4.\nDSI\u2019s case against iCon Group execs ready for prosecution\n5.\nNew Year festivities expected to net over THB62 billion",

The connecting route between the two ports spans approximately 90 kilometres and consists of a six-lane expressway and standard gauge railway tracks. The project takes advantage of the country's geographical location as a strategic transportation and trade hub in Southeast Asia.\nThe land bridge project is part of the Southern Economic Corridor development programme and is expected to be completed by 2039.\nSrettha expressed confidence that the land bridge project would seamlessly assimilate with the infrastructure under the Belt and Road Initiative and further complement the global transportation network. He added that Thailand is ready to cooperate with China and partners under the BRI to ensure sustainable, comprehensive and equal growth for all.\nAfter the meeting, Srettha met with\nWang Tongzhou\n, president of China Harbour Engineering Company Ltd (CHEC) to discuss possible investment in the land bridge and other projects in Thailand, including the highway and rail system in phase 3 of Laem Chabang Port in Chonburi province.\nCHEC has been conducting construction and civil engineering businesses in Thailand since 1994 through its subsidiary CHCC (Thai) Company Limited.\nSrettha later met with\nDaniel Li\n, chief executive officer of Geely Holding Group to discuss its investment in automotive manufacturing facilities in Thailand with a focus on electric vehicles and related components.\nGeely plans to start selling its EV pickup trucks in Thailand by the end of this month and is also interested in investing in solar energy and battery swap stations in Thailand.\nTAGS\nChina\nland bridge\nChumphon\nRanong\nAndaman Sea\nBelt and Road Initiative\nBeijing\nBreaking News\nRelated\nPM\u2019s Office Minister to sign MoU in China on media cooperation\nOctober 15, 2023\nSrettha to meet President Xi, Chinese premier during visit to China next week\nOctober 13, 2023\nSrettha calls on Thais to back digital wallet scheme, so it can fill pockets by Feb 1\nOctober 14, 2023\nMOST VIEWED\n1.\nThaksin proposes ideas to develop Thailand's Northeastern region\n2.\nUncover Sisaket\u2019s creative heart through music at vibrant festival\n3.\nSuriya unveils plans for closer Thailand-China railway link\n4.\nDSI\u2019s case against iCon Group execs ready for prosecution\n5.\nNew Year festivities expected to net over THB62 billion",

However, the massive loans backing the projects have burdened poorer countries with&nbsp;heavy debts, in some cases leading to China taking control of those assets.\nAt the forum\u2019s opening ceremony at the ornate and cavernous Great Hall of the People, Xi promised that two Chinese-backed development banks \u2013 the China Development Bank and the Export\u2013Import Bank of China \u2013 will each set up 350 billion yuan ($47.9 billion) financing windows. An additional 80 billion yuan ($11 billion) will be invested in Beijing\u2019s Silk Road Fund to support BRI projects.\n\u201cWe will comprehensively remove restrictions on foreign investment access in the manufacturing sector,\u201d Xi said. He said China would further open up \u201ccross-border trade and investment in services and expand market access for digital products\u201d and carry out reforms of state-owned enterprises and in sectors such as the digital economy, intellectual property rights and government procurement.\nThe pledges of hefty support from Beijing come at a time when China\u2019s economy has slowed and foreign investment has plunged.\nXi alluded to efforts by the United States and its allies to&nbsp;reduce their reliance on Chinese manufacturing and supply chains&nbsp;amid&nbsp;heightened competition&nbsp;and diplomatic frictions and reiterated promises that Beijing would create a fairer environment for foreign firms.\n\u201cWe do not engage in ideological confrontation, geopolitical games nor clique political confrontation,\u201d Xi said. \u201cWe oppose unilateral sanctions, economic coercion and the decoupling and severance of chains,\u201d a reference to moves elsewhere to diversify industrial supply chains.\nReiterating Chinese complaints that such moves are meant to limit China\u2019s growth, Xi said that \u201cviewing others\u2019 development as a threat or taking economic interdependence as a risk will not make one\u2019s own life better or speed up one\u2019s development.\u201d\n\u201cChina can only do well when the world is doing well,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen China does well, the world will get even better.\u201d\nAddressing the forum right after Xi, Putin praised BRI as being \u201ctruly important, global, future-oriented, aimed at creating more equitable, multipolar world relations.\u201d\n\u201cThis is truly a global plan,\u201d he said, adding that it aligns with Russia\u2019s plan \u201cto form a large Eurasian space, as a space of cooperation and interaction of like-minded people, where a variety of integration processes will be linked.\u201d He referred to other regional organizations, such as the security-oriented Shanghai Cooperation Organization, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean), and the Eurasian Economic Union of former Soviet states.\nWith the BRI, China has become a major financer of development projects on a par with the World Bank. The Chinese government says the initiative has launched more than 3,000 projects and \u201cgalvanized\u201d nearly $1 trillion in investment.\nIt has also attracted criticism from the US, India and others that China is engaging in \u201cdebt trap\u201d diplomacy: Making loans Beijing knew governments would likely default on, enabling Chinese interests to take control of the assets. An oft-cited example is a port that the Sri Lankan government ended up leasing to a Chinese company for 99 years. Many economists say China did not make the bad loans intentionally.\nA key concern is whether the BRI can become more sustainable in terms of debt burdens, said Steve Tsang, director of the SOAS China Institute in London.\nThe initiative now aims to become smaller and greener after&nbsp;a decade of big projects&nbsp;that boosted trade but left big debts and raised environmental concerns.\nChina will also \u201cmonitor the debt sustainability of BRI countries more closely,\u201d Christoph Nedopil, director of the Asia Institute at Griffith University in Australia, wrote in a report.\n\u201cChinese financial institutions will likely limit their exposure to projects that do not have stable cash flows from within the project,\u201d he added. \u201cThat being said, \u2018beautiful\u2019 strategic projects, such as strategic railways or ports, will still find Chinese financial creditors.\u201d\nAP\nand\nReuters\nTAGS\nXi Jinping\nChina\nBelt and Road Initiative\nForum\nBeijing\nRelated\nWill 6-day workweek for executives help Samsung avert crisis?\nApril 21, 2024\nMassive river flooding expected in China's Guangdong, threatening millions\nApril 21, 2024\nMyanmar general killed in drone attack near Thai border\nApril 21, 2024\nMOST VIEWED\n1.\nThaksin proposes ideas to develop Thailand's Northeastern region\n2.\nUncover Sisaket\u2019s creative heart through music at vibrant festival\n3.\nSuriya unveils plans for closer Thailand-China railway link\n4.\nDSI\u2019s case against iCon Group execs ready for prosecution\n5.\nNew Year festivities expected to net over THB62 billion",

        "content": "World\nA decade of progress: The BRI's global transformation\nMONDAY, OCTOBER 16, 2023\nPlay\nAs the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) reaches its 10th-anniversary milestone, China's State Council Information Office has unveiled a White Paper titled \"The Belt and Road Initiative: A Key Pillar of the Global Community of Shared Future\" on October 10.\nThis White Paper provides a comprehensive retrospective of the BRI's journey, tracing its evolution from a Chinese proposal to a global initiative with tangible accomplishments. Essentially, it serves as both a decade's report card and a visionary roadmap for the future of Belt and Road collaboration.\nFrom its ambitious inception to its execution, the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) has surpassed its early projections in remarkable ways over the past decade.\nIn terms of geographic reach, the BRI has garnered participation from more than 150 countries and over 30 international organizations, accounting for almost 75 %&nbsp;of the world's population.\nAcross the spectrum of its engagement, the BRI extends its influence into a diverse array of domains, spanning economics, culture, and ecology. Whether we're talking about the hard connectivity of land-based roads and sea routes, the soft connectivity entailing collaborative efforts to enhance rules and standards, or the people-to-people connectivity in various arenas like education, culture, sports, tourism, and archaeology, the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) has woven a sprawling network of cooperation and shared gains across the world.\nThe White Paper is replete with data and illustrations showcasing the tangible advantages and returns that the BRI has delivered to the countries involved.\nThe Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) marked a defining moment in China's global involvement, signifying its ascent to a prominent position on the world platform.\nThroughout the past decade, it has ushered in a transformative era, leaving an indelible imprint on the global terrain and underscoring its far-reaching influence across the world.\nNumerous flagship projects, such as the Mombasa-Nairobi railway, the China-Laos railway, and the Jakarta-Bandung high-speed railway, are completed and operational.\nThese milestones are poised to give a significant boost to emerging economies. According to World Bank estimates, by the year 2030, the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is expected to generate a staggering $1.6 trillion in annual global revenue, equivalent to 1.3 %&nbsp;of the global GDP. As this network of transport corridors and economic hubs continues to expand, there is immense potential for enhancing trade, spurring investment, and improving the quality of life for countless citizens across participating nations.\nSince the initiation of the BRI, the aspiration of forging a community with a shared future has evolved from mere conceptualization to concrete action and from visionary idealism to tangible achievement.\nAn increasing number of nations have come to appreciate China's assertion that development is not the exclusive privilege of a select few Western countries, but rather an inherent right accessible to all nations.\nImran Khalid\nDr Imran Khalid is a freelance contributor based in Karachi, Pakistan. He qualified as a physician from Dow Medical University in Karachi in 1991, and has a master's degree in international relations from Karachi University.\nThe BRI has orchestrated a profound transformation on the world stage for five compelling reasons. Firstly, it has elevated the discourse on development to a pivotal global concern. Secondly, it has fostered an unprecedented bond between China and developing nations. Thirdly, it has paved the path toward a fresh global realignment and, by extension, a novel paradigm of global politics. Fourthly, it has disseminated the fundamental tenets of Chinese philosophy on a global scale. Lastly, it has given rise to a novel breed of international institution, offering a tantalizing glimpse into a world order where the welfare of the majority takes precedence over the interests of the few\u2014a truly remarkable reimagining of global dynamics.\nThe Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) should be recognized as a dynamic force, continually adapting in harmony with the ever-evolving global landscape. &nbsp;At its outset, the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) was primarily centred on colossal infrastructure projects.\nHowever, it has evolved in tandem with the changing times, embracing the rise of small and medium-sized enterprises, environmental sustainability, climate consciousness, digital innovation, and green initiatives. Although the initial impact of the Covid-19&nbsp;pandemic temporarily slowed its progress, the BRI has since bounced back with renewed vigour as the world slowly returns to a semblance of normalcy.\nThis resilience serves as a testament to the BRI's remarkable adaptability in the face of ever-shifting global conditions. Indeed, the BRI stands as a sturdy and agile force, mirroring the ever-changing contours of the world it engages with.\nA curious phenomenon emerges when we examine the spectrum of countries engaged in the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Developing nations consistently exhibit a favourable stance toward BRI collaboration, whereas the sentiment among developed countries is not uniformly enthusiastic. It is essential to acknowledge that developing countries often bear more significant development burdens.\nNevertheless, it is important to note that the BRI's inclusive ethos extends to all nations, with a desire for the participation of as many countries as possible, including those that are more developed. Ever since 2013 when China launched its magnanimous BRI, Western capitals have been viewing this monumental developmental project with scepticism; their response is tainted by an unwarranted wave of negativity and misinformation.\nIt is quite evident that certain think tanks and media in the West, particularly within the United States, harbour certain political biases when it comes to their assessments of the BRI. It is common to find these studies riddled with allegations of so-called debt traps, complaints of a lack of transparency and concerns about the environmental impact. It seems as though there is a concerted effort to cast a shadow over this monumental endeavour.\nThe BRI is not merely a vehicle for China's economic growth but a pathway to shared prosperity. It aims to bridge regional divides, boost trade, and foster sustainable development across Asia, Europe, Latin America and Africa. Yet, Western powers, driven by misplaced apprehensions, have been persistently fueling a campaign of disinformation against the initiative. These myopic narratives against the BRI often disregard its transformative potential, neglecting the countless opportunities for cooperation and progress it offers to the world.\nOver the span of a decade, from 2013 to 2022, China's trade with Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) participant nations has surged to a staggering $19.1 trillion, marked by an annual growth rate averaging 6.4 %. Impressively, the cumulative two-way investment between China and its partner countries has reached $380 billion, with China contributing $240 billion, as revealed in the white paper. These numbers illuminate the transformative impact of the BRI, both as a catalyst for trade and as a source of significant investment in the participating nations, underscoring its pivotal role in shaping global economic dynamics.\nThe future of Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) cooperation is rich with possibilities. As highlighted in the white paper, the BRI is a profound, long-term, and systematic global endeavour of the 21st century, and it has embarked on an enduring journey. The original framework of BRI, while primarily focusing on partnerships with developing nations, has become the bedrock upon which the Global Development Initiative, Global Security Initiative, and Global Civilization Initiative have flourished.\nThese progressive offshoots represent an intentional expansion of the initial vision, offering a wide array of dynamic approaches to fortify global development and the accomplishments of the BRI. As traditional infrastructure projects persist, the rising prominence of digital connectivity is set to drive substantial demand for digital infrastructure across the region. This digital frontier is poised to assume a central role in the next phase of BRI implementation.\nConcurrently, the green and blue economies are poised to emerge as twin drivers. These multifaceted developments paint a promising picture for growth, collaboration and shared prosperity. The true essence of the BRI lies in its lasting legacy, especially as it reaches its full completion. The fulfilment of this ambitious venture brings forth a rich exchange of knowledge, the propagation of ideas and the nurturing of innovative concepts. It is a journey of vast proportions, extending far beyond a mere decade, embodying a commitment to the long term.\n&nbsp;\nTAGS\nGlobal Transformation\neconomic progress\na decade\nChina\nAsia-Pacific region\nBelt and Road Initiative\nprogress\nRelated\nWill 6-day workweek for executives help Samsung avert crisis?\nApril 21, 2024\nMassive river flooding expected in China's Guangdong, threatening millions\nApril 21, 2024\nMyanmar general killed in drone attack near Thai border\nApril 21, 2024\nMOST VIEWED\n1.\nThaksin proposes ideas to develop Thailand's Northeastern region\n2.\nUncover Sisaket\u2019s creative heart through music at vibrant festival\n3.\nSuriya unveils plans for closer Thailand-China railway link\n4.\nDSI\u2019s case against iCon Group execs ready for prosecution\n5.\nNew Year festivities expected to net over THB62 billion",

        "content": "More\nIs India Mulling a Potential Global Geopolitical Game Changer?\nTUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 19, 2023\n|\nPrem Singh Gill\nPlay\nThe recent announcement of the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC) during the G20 leaders' summit in New Delhi in September 2023 has ignited significant discourse regarding its ability to counter China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).\nThis ambitious project, which spans two continents through extensive transnational rail and shipping networks, holds the potential to reshape the global economic and geopolitical landscape. The emergence of\nIMEC\noccurs against the backdrop of growing apprehensions about China's far-reaching presence across various continents, prompting questions about its motivations and influence, whilst it is interesting to explore the significance of the G20 Summit 2023 and evaluate whether the IMEC positions India as a substantial counterforce to the\nBRI\n.\nThe\nG20 Summit\n2023 showcased India's growing influence on the world stage. India underscored its willingness to play a more significant role in shaping global economic policies and strategies. This event provided India with a platform to assert its geopolitical significance and articulate its vision for regional and international affairs. The announcement of the IMEC project on the sidelines of the summit signalled India's intent to seize this opportunity and challenge China's BRI, which has been the defining infrastructure initiative of the 21st century.\nChina's BRI, spearheaded by President\nXi Jinping\n, has been a subject of both admiration and apprehension. It has injected substantial investments into infrastructure projects across\nAsia\n,\nAfrica\n,\nEurope\n, and\nLatin America\n, with the aim of enhancing connectivity and trade. However, the sheer scale and scope of the BRI have raised concerns among many nations. Critics have pointed to issues such as debt dependency, environmental impact, and questions about Beijing's strategic intentions. The BRI's expansive reach has given China considerable influence over countries and regions participating in the initiative.\nThe IMEC project's potential as a counterbalance to the BRI is rooted in its strategic positioning and objectives. The corridors of the IMEC connect India, the\nArabian Gulf\n, and Europe, offering a viable alternative route for trade, investment, and connectivity. By providing an alternative to China's infrastructure dominance, the IMEC could help countries diversify their options and reduce reliance on a single, China-centric network. Here, we assess the key factors that make the IMEC a potential game changer.\nThe\nIndia-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor\n(IMEC) carries significant geopolitical significance, reflecting India's ambition to play a more prominent role in shaping regional and global geopolitics. By aligning India with the interests of Gulf states and European nations, this initiative creates a strategic partnership that has the potential to challenge China's dominance in the\nEurasian\nlandmass. India's proactive involvement in the IMEC project elevates its diplomatic standing and influence within the region.\nFrom an economic perspective, the IMEC presents an opportunity for enhanced integration among participating nations. The streamlined trade, reduced transportation costs, and increased investment prospects facilitated by the IMEC corridors can catalyse economic growth and development along its route. The economic synergy that emerges has the potential to benefit millions of people and can act as a compelling incentive for countries to embrace the project.\nOne of the central aspects of the IMEC's appeal is the diversification of trade routes that it offers. Countries concerned about overreliance on China's\nBelt and Road Initiative\n(BRI) can view the IMEC as an attractive alternative. This diversification enhances economic resilience and reduces vulnerability to geopolitical manipulation, providing countries with more agency over their trade and infrastructure choices.\nEnergy security is another key dimension where the IMEC can exert influence. The Arabian Gulf serves as a vital source of global energy supplies, and the IMEC's northern corridor can contribute to a more secure and stable energy supply route to Europe. This is of particular significance as Europe seeks to diversify its energy sources, reducing dependency on any single supplier and bolstering its energy security.\nBeyond the economic and geopolitical aspects, the IMEC offers India a platform for projecting soft power on the global stage. By spearheading this project, India positions itself as a responsible global player committed to principles of regional cooperation, sustainable development, and economic growth. This not only enhances India's soft power but also improves its international reputation, making it an appealing partner for countries seeking alternatives to the BRI.\nHowever, despite its immense potential, the IMEC is not without its challenges. Chief among them is the need for substantial financial resources to build and maintain the extensive infrastructure required for the project. Securing adequate funding for the IMEC's successful execution is a complex endeavour, especially considering the considerable financial commitments involved in large-scale infrastructure development.\nAdditionally, the geopolitical landscape across the regions covered by the IMEC project is rife with complexities and conflicts. Negotiating agreements and managing relations among participating nations will be a formidable task, requiring effective diplomacy and conflict resolution mechanisms. The success of the IMEC hinges on these diplomatic efforts and the ability to navigate the intricate web of geopolitical interests.\nEnvironmental concerns are another critical consideration. The construction and operation of the IMEC corridors may have far-reaching environmental implications. Sustainable practices and comprehensive environmental impact assessments are imperative to minimise harm to ecosystems and address concerns raised by environmental activists and local communities.\nAnd finally, to ensure the security and stability of the IMEC routes is paramount. Political instability or conflicts in any part of the corridor could disrupt trade and infrastructure development. Therefore, comprehensive security measures and diplomatic efforts will be indispensable in mitigating potential risks and challenges.\nOn the whole, the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC) emerges as a formidable initiative with the potential to significantly alter the global economic and geopolitical landscape. It stands as a testament to India's growing influence and ambition on the world stage, as exemplified by its hosting of the G20 Summit in 2023. By positioning itself at the forefront of the IMEC project, India has articulated a clear vision of its role in shaping regional and international affairs, aligning itself with the interests of Gulf states and European nations.\nThe IMEC's potential as a counterbalance to China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is multi-faceted. It offers a strategic alternative route for trade and investment, diversifying options for countries concerned about overreliance on China-centric networks. Additionally, the IMEC can stimulate economic integration, reduce transportation costs, and enhance energy security, thereby fostering sustainable development and economic growth along its corridors. India's leadership in this initiative enhances its soft power projection and reputation as a responsible global player committed to cooperation and sustainable development. However, the road ahead for the IMEC is paved with substantial challenges. The complexities of navigating geopolitical tensions, addressing environmental concerns, and ensuring security and stability along the corridor all pose formidable obstacles. But then, these will require adept diplomacy, international collaboration, and a steadfast commitment to addressing these challenges. The IMEC's potential as a game changer and a counterbalance to the BRI remains contingent on India's ability to effectively manage and implement this ambitious project, an endeavour that holds far-reaching implications for the economic and geopolitical dynamics of the regions it encompasses.\nPrem Singh Gill is an Adjunct Lecturer at the Faculty of Political Science, Chulalongkorn University and Thammasat University\n&nbsp;\nTAGS\ngame changer\nIndia\nGeopolitical tensions\nG20\nIndia-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor\nIMEC\nRelated\nEarn extra income with the Thailand Elite Visa Referral program\nApril 19, 2024\nWant to take a break from clich\u00e9 movies? 4+3 top Thai films are then\u2026 calling!\nApril 19, 2024\nCelebrate vibrant Songkran at the \"Siam Paragon Ultrasonic Water Festival 2024\"\nApril 13, 2024\nMOST VIEWED\n1.\nThaksin proposes ideas to develop Thailand's Northeastern region\n2.\nUncover Sisaket\u2019s creative heart through music at vibrant festival\n3.\nSuriya unveils plans for closer Thailand-China railway link\n4.\nDSI\u2019s case against iCon Group execs ready for prosecution\n5.\nNew Year festivities expected to net over THB62 billion",

The leaders and representatives of\nIndonesia\n,\nLaos\n,\nBrunei\n,\nCambodia\n,\nMalaysia\n, the\nPhilippines\n,\nSingapore\n,&nbsp;\nVietnam\nand\nThailand\nattended the meeting.\nLi commended the development of ties between China and Asean, saying that over the past decade,\nChina\nand Asean have maintained a relationship characterized by sincerity, mutual assistance, mutual benefit, mutual coordination and inclusiveness. They have worked together to forge a path of long-term good neighbourliness, friendship, and shared development and prosperity amid the evolving global landscape, he added.\nTo build a closer\nChina-Asean&nbsp;community\nwith a shared future, the premier urged both sides to work together to create an economic growth centre by strengthening connectivity and deepening cooperation on enhancing the industrial and supply chains.\nHe underlined the need to promote cooperation in emerging industries, such as new energy vehicles, photovoltaics, and artificial intelligence, expand people-to-people exchanges and enhance cooperation in culture, tourism, and training, as well as among the youth.\nNoting China and Asean&nbsp;are inseparable neighbours, brothers and partners, Li emphasized the importance of maintaining regional peace and stability by actively advancing consultations on the \"\nCode of Conduct in the South China Sea\n\" and cooperating in combating telecommunications and cyber fraud.\nThe leaders of Asean&nbsp;countries attending the meeting highly praised the achievements of Asean-China cooperation, saying that the comprehensive strategic partnership between Asean&nbsp;and China has brought great benefits to the people of the region by promoting regional peace, development and stability.\nAsean&nbsp;countries are willing to further enhance mutual trust and strengthen alignment with the\nBelt and Road Initiative\n, deepen cooperation in agriculture, trade, investment, digital economy, technology, education, culture, and other fields, and work together to address global challenges such as climate change, they said.\nAsean&nbsp;countries welcome the progress made in formulating the \"Code of Conduct in the South China Sea\" and look forward to the early completion of the negotiations on upgrading of the\nAsean-China Free Trade Area\n, they added.\nA joint statement was issued at the meeting on strengthening alignment between the Belt and Road Initiative and the\nAsean&nbsp;Outlook\non the\nIndo-Pacific\nfor mutually beneficial cooperation.\nThe meeting also adopted a number of documents on cooperation between China and Asean&nbsp;in the fields of agriculture, E-commerce, and scientific and technological innovation.\n2024 was declared as the\nChina-Asean&nbsp;Year of Cultural\nand\nPeople-to-People Exchanges\nat the meeting.\nAsean concerned over US-China relationship as tensions could stoke flashpoints: PM Lee\nSoutheast Asia is watching the trajectory of the\nUnited States-China relationship\nwith great concern, as tensions between the two countries could easily stoke existing flashpoints in the region, Singapore Prime Minister\nLee Hsien Loong\nsaid on Wednesday.\nShould this happen, the peace, prosperity and stability that Asean has enjoyed for decades could be undermined, PM Lee warned.\nSpeaking during a meeting between bloc leaders and Chinese Premier\nLi Qiang\n, Lee said it was crucial for both China and the US to continue talking to each other, build strategic trust at all levels, and strive for greater cooperation.\n\u201cBoth the US and China need to show leadership to address a whole range of global issues affecting all of us,\u201d he said.\nAsean leaders are in the capital of Indonesia for the 43rd Asean Summit and related meetings, where they will also have talks with external partners.\nIn a meeting that bloc leaders had with US Vice-President\nKamala Harris\nlater on Wednesday, Lee reiterated that the US-China relationship is a longer-term concern for the region.\n\u201cSoutheast Asia is concerned that a miscalculation could draw the region into serious conflict,\u201d he said.\nIn the meeting between Asean and China, Lee said that the two have forged close bonds of friendship over the past three decades.\n\u201cAs we look ahead to the next phase of our comprehensive strategic partnership, I am confident that we will build an even stronger Asean-China relationship based on mutual trust and respect,\u201d he said.\nLee suggested two areas in which Asean and China can more closely cooperate, to build upon their upgraded relations brought about through the comprehensive strategic partnership in 2021.\nThe first is connectivity, where both sides should further liberalise the\nAsean-China Air Transport Agreement\n, he said, as this would further encourage people-to-people exchanges.\nThe second is the digital economy, he added, in which more should be done to allow cross-border transactions to take place seamlessly and sustainably.\nSuch efforts support the\nAsean Outlook on the Indo-Pacific\n(\nAOIP\n), said PM Lee.\nThe AOIP&nbsp;lays out the bloc\u2019s common position on regional cooperation, security and prosperity, as well as its stance on not taking sides with any major powers competing for influence in the region.\nIn the Asean chair statement on Wednesday, the support of all partners to the AOIP was appreciated.\nHowever, the statement \u201cexpressed concern over the intensifying geopolitical tensions in the region, and further underlined the value and relevance of the AOIP to Asean\u2019s peace, security, stability and prosperity\u201d.\nBy supporting this initiative, trust and confidence to address challenging issues can be built, said PM Lee, offering as an example the disputes in the South China Sea.\nThe waterway has overlapping territorial claims by China, Taiwan and four Asean states \u2013 Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam.\nRecently, tensions have also simmered over China\u2019s new national map featuring a 10-dash line that includes the waters of the Southeast Asian nations\u2019 coasts as well as part of the northeast of India,&nbsp;triggering objections from several sides.\nPM Lee said that Asean and China have continued to engage each other to maintain peace and stability in the area.\n\u201cAnd we should intensify efforts to conclude a code of conduct that is in accordance with universally agreed, recognised principles of international law, including the 1982 Unclos (United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea), and also safeguards the rights and interests of all parties,\u201d he said.\nUnclos is an international legal framework that governs the oceans and seas.\nDuring talks between Asean leaders and Ms Harris, PM Lee said that the continued role of the US in the region was an important foundation of Southeast Asia\u2019s peace, stability and prosperity and that the bloc would welcome efforts to further enhance cooperation.\nAsean supports and looks forward to the establishment of a US-Asean Centre, he added.\nThe White House said that the centre, based in Washington DC, would serve as a key hub for Asean\u2019s engagement with the US and facilitate official engagements and capacity building programmes, as well as conduct research.\nPM Lee said the bloc is also happy with initiatives taken with the US so far, such as the launch of the comprehensive strategic partnership between Asean and the US in 2022.\n\u201cTo sustain our good relations over the longer term, we need to expand people-to-people exchanges and deepen institutional links,\u201d he said.\nAsean leaders had a separate meeting with their counterparts from South Korea and Japan, as well as a combined meeting with the two and China.\nIn the meeting with South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol, PM Lee suggested prioritising the proposed upgrade of the Asean-Korea free trade agreement to keep it relevant and fit for purpose.\nBolstering cooperation in emerging sectors such as the digital economy, fintech and cyber security was also brought up, and PM Lee said that these areas underpin Asean\u2019s post-pandemic recovery and will be key engines of growth.\nHe also said the situation in the Korean Peninsula is worrying. Singapore has consistently condemned North Korea\u2019s missile launches, as these have further raised tensions there and violated United Nations Security Council resolutions.\n\u201cSingapore will continue to work with the international community to promote peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula. We hope that Asean-centred fora such as the Asean Regional Forum will provide a useful platform for constructive dialogue,\u201d he said.\nIn a separate meeting that Asean leaders had with Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, PM Lee said Japan can further cooperate with the region in the areas of climate change and the green economy, as well as connectivity.\nHe also underlined how Japan is an important partner in the region\u2019s digitalisation efforts, as well as an active contributor to its capacity-building in cyber security.\n\u201cAsean and Japan should continue working towards an open, inclusive and interoperable digital ecosystem,\u201d he said.\nCao&nbsp;Desheng\n,\nChina Daily\nHariz Baharudin\n,\nThe Straits Times\n&nbsp;\nTAGS\nChina\nASEAN\nAsean Summit\nUS-Asean summit\nChina-Asean\nRelated\nWill 6-day workweek for executives help Samsung avert crisis?\nApril 21, 2024\nMassive river flooding expected in China's Guangdong, threatening millions\nApril 21, 2024\nMyanmar general killed in drone attack near Thai border\nApril 21, 2024\nMOST VIEWED\n1.\nThaksin proposes ideas to develop Thailand's Northeastern region\n2.\nUncover Sisaket\u2019s creative heart through music at vibrant festival\n3.\nSuriya unveils plans for closer Thailand-China railway link\n4.\nDSI\u2019s case against iCon Group execs ready for prosecution\n5.\nNew Year festivities expected to net over THB62 billion",

        "content": "World\nFirst Bullet Train ushers in new era of connectivity for Southeast Asia\nFRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 01, 2023\nPlay\nAfter years of delays and challenges, Southeast Asia's first bullet train is expected to hit the rails soon.\nThe\nJakarta-Bandung High-Speed Railway\n, or\nHSR\n, is the most prominent\nBelt and Road Initiative\nproject in\nIndonesia\n. It will be holding its trial run as the\nBRI\nenters its 10th anniversary. Analysts and industry leaders noted how this project can strengthen connectivity in one of the archipelago's biggest and busiest islands. They also cited how this railway aligns with Indonesia's economic goals and spurred technology transfer from\nChina\nto Indonesia.\nThe HSR will improve Indonesia's productivity and global competitiveness, said\nAditya Dwi Laksana\n, chairman of the road and railway transport forum at the\nIndonesia Transportation Society\n.\nLaksana said the presence of a bullet train will increase people's mobility and raise the quality of public transport in Southeast Asia's biggest economy.\n\"This train will provide (higher value) transportation services, mainly in terms of safety, punctuality, time travel, as well as the comfort of the trip. (Commuters) will have more (when) travelling between Jakarta and Bandung or vice versa. The HSR also has a competitive advantage compared to other modes of public transportation,\" he said.\nThe HSR has a top speed of 350 kilometres per hour. Once operational, commuters who take the train can cut their usual three-hour journey time between Jakarta, the nation's capital, and Bandung in West Java Province to just 40 minutes.\nBoth cities are located on the island of\nJava\n, the fourth-biggest island in the archipelago and home to roughly half of Indonesia's population.\nThe HSR was supposed to hold its first trial run in August, in time for Indonesia's\nIndependence Day\ncelebrations on August 17. But the\nPT Kereta Cepat Indonesia China\n, or\nKCIC\n, the Sino-Indonesian consortium that constructed the railway, has postponed the trial and its subsequent launch to later this month, as the operation of the HSR requires careful preparation.\nSafety and comfort\nThe KCIC said it prioritizes the safety and comfort of train commuters. It said the public can travel on the HSR for free during the trial run.\nThe KCIC was created in 2015 after China successfully bid against Japan for the project. The high-speed line was supposed to be completed in 2018. But issues such as the Covid-19 pandemic disrupted the work schedule. Last year, China shipped a high-speed electric passenger train and an inspection train designed especially for the Indonesian project. These trains were designed by\nCRRC Qingdao Sifang\nand it was the first time that China exported high-speed trains.\nSiwage Dharma Negara\n, co-coordinator for the\nIndonesia Studies Program\nat the\nISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute\nin\nSingapore\n, said the challenges and delays that the HSR project has encountered proved that infrastructure development, while ambitious, is not always smooth sailing. People are also not likely to feel its impact immediately, he added.\n\"It is not easy to build infrastructure, it takes longer time than expected,\" Negara said. He said policy planners need to rethink the costs and benefits of any future infrastructure project. \"We have to be careful, to be very selective, to choose what kind of project is useful and beneficial for countries like Indonesia.\"\nLinda Yin-nor Tjia\n, an associate professor at the\nDepartment of Public and International Affairs\nat the\nCity University of Hong Kong\n, said Indonesia's decentralization strategy since the late 1990s has encouraged \"a plurality of opinions\" among the executive arm of the central government, especially if it involves complicated project implementation like that of the HSR.\nTjia has extensively researched high-speed railway development in China and Japan. She said the Jakarta-Bandung HSR has been checked by multiple stakeholders and this has led to delays and rescheduling arrangements.\n\"Infrastructure construction is challenging not only because of economic and technological reasons. Political and institutional factors also matter,\" Tjia said.\nShinta Widjaja Kamdani\n, chief executive officer of the Jakarta-based conglomerate\nSintesa Group\nand chairwoman of the I\nndonesian Employers Association\n, said the HSR is not just an investment in connectivity but can serve as a central point for understanding the facts behind high-speed trains that Indonesia can use for future development.\nKamdani noted that Indonesian workers have learned from Chinese technical experts who came in for the HSR project.\nLaksana said developing infrastructure is key to economic growth and the biggest challenge in developing a country's infrastructure is the lack of funding and technology transfer.\nBut he underlined that the BRI is an economic cooperation between China and Indonesia and this partnership can overcome obstacles related to financing and technology transfer.\nWith the Jakarta-Bandung HSR set to begin operations soon, Laksana said the era of high-speed railway technology has finally arrived in Indonesia.\n\"The key is the transfer of technology and knowledge,\" he said, noting that technology transfer can enhance the knowledge, skill and capability of Indonesian workers.\nTjia said it is \"very challenging\" to transfer core HSR technology.\n\"But train operation involves many different components and some of the technology could be transferred to the non-HSR sector,\" she said.\nPrime Sarmiento\nChina Daily\nAsia News Network\nTAGS\nBullet Train\nSoutheast Asia\nCONNECTIVITY\nChina\nIndonesia\nRelated\nWill 6-day workweek for executives help Samsung avert crisis?\nApril 21, 2024\nMassive river flooding expected in China's Guangdong, threatening millions\nApril 21, 2024\nMyanmar general killed in drone attack near Thai border\nApril 21, 2024\nMOST VIEWED\n1.\nThaksin proposes ideas to develop Thailand's Northeastern region\n2.\nUncover Sisaket\u2019s creative heart through music at vibrant festival\n3.\nSuriya unveils plans for closer Thailand-China railway link\n4.\nDSI\u2019s case against iCon Group execs ready for prosecution\n5.\nNew Year festivities expected to net over THB62 billion",

        "content": "World\nChinese academic blames geopolitical tensions for increased protectionism\nFRIDAY, AUGUST 18, 2023\n|\nJarupong Krisanaraj\nPlay\nGlobalisation is necessary for boosting economic growth, a Chinese academic said on Thursday at the 2023 National and International Conference of the National Institute of Development Administration (Nic-Nida 2023) in Bangkok.\nJia Yu of Peking University's Institute of New Structural Economics said that rising geopolitical tensions had led to more protectionism and increasing use of cross-border restrictions on national security grounds.\nAccording to the Global Trade Alert website, trade restrictions imposed by countries had risen significantly, especially in the high-tech sector, she said.\nShe said globalisation had been affected by Covid-19, the Russia-Ukraine conflict and climate change. The first risk to business growth is global supply chain bottlenecks and logistics restrictions, she added.\n\u201cToday, we are facing re-shoring [transferring operations back to home country], near-shoring [relocating businesses to nearby countries] and friend-shoring [rerouting supply chain to countries politically and economically safe to avoid disruption],\u201d she said.\nShe added that resilience, agility and sustainability, as well as \u201cjust-in-time and just-in-case methodologies\u201d, could reduce risk of large-scale disruptions and complexity.\nHowever, Yu said globalisation is not going away as 60% of all global trade flows across regional boundaries. Every region on the planet is dependent on another region for a quarter of their imports, she said.\nShe added that globalisation had helped average productivity levels more than double, secured a 24% increase in average income, and a decline in absolute poverty rate to 10%.\nOn the other hand, she said deglobalisation and economic fragmentation could be costly for the global economy.\nCiting an International Monetary Fund study on the effects of elimination of trade in high-tech manufacturing and energy across rival blocs, she said the result suggests sizeable output losses of about 1.2% to 1.5% of world gross domestic product (GDP).\n\"Trade-intensive countries in the Asia-Pacific region are disproportionately affected with losses of about 3.3% in the more severe scenario,\" she said.\n\"In areas of common interest, such as climate change mitigation, food security and pandemic preparedness, international cooperation remains the best approach to make progress towards common goals.\u201d\nOverview of China\u2019s economy\nShe said the East Asia region had witnessed a growth in contribution to the global economy over the past four decades from 15% in 1980 to 32.0% in 2022.\nThe robust growth was all thanks to the development of infrastructure and personnel, as well as openness to trade, equality of access to income, governments' clear and long-term vision, security and political stability, she explained.\nShe added that China is now very close to becoming a high-income country with a GDP&nbsp;per capita of US$12,850 in 2022 compared to $220 in 1980.\n\"More than 1.4 billion population are working hard to promote China to become a high-income country,\" she said.\nDespite the impact from the Covid-19 pandemic, she said China had exported $3.55 trillion worth of goods and services last year. Another huge contribution is China eliminated absolute poverty by 2020, she added.\nDemystifying China\u2019s economy\nYu said four factors had helped boost China\u2019s economy: effective markets, government facilitation, entrepreneurship, and continuous innovation.\nShe pointed out that the Chinese government's move to facilitate the private sector was the key to stimulating the country's economy. She added that market reform is key to unleashing entrepreneurship and creativity potential.\nMore than 50% of tax revenue, more than 60% of GDP, 70% of innovative products, and more than 80% of total employment and 90% of incremental job creation came from the private sector,\" she said.\nAnother success is special economic zones to develop the country's infrastructure and attract foreign direct investments.\nShe said China is acting like a \"flying dragon\u201d, thanks to further economic development and industrial upgrading. She expects the Belt and Road initiative to benefit China and every partner in the world.\nDual circulation strategy\nYu said China has proposed a dual circulation strategy to maintain balance in domestic and international trade.\nIt involves expanding domestic demand, focusing on the domestic market, improving the country's capacity for innovation, reducing dependence on foreign markets, and at the same time remaining open to the outside world, she explained.\nShe said China would continue to work with all countries and all parties to share the opportunities in its vast market.\n\"China will step up efforts to cultivate a robust domestic market, upgrade trade in goods, develop new mechanisms for trade in services, and import more quality products,\" she said.\n\"China will establish pilot zones for Silk Road e-commerce cooperation and build national demonstration zones for innovative development of trade in services, so as to encourage innovation in trade and promote high-quality Belt and Road cooperation.\u201d\nTAGS\nGlobalisation\nChinese\neconomy\nNida\nGeopolitics\nRelated\nNIC-NIDA Conference 2023: Sustainable Development through Re-globalization\nMay 23, 2023\nFrom vision to reality: Making the Port Authority of Thailand world-class\nMarch 31, 2023\nAmbitious woman CEO aims to take Dusit brand to global heights\nOctober 30, 2022\nMOST VIEWED\n1.\nThaksin proposes ideas to develop Thailand's Northeastern region\n2.\nUncover Sisaket\u2019s creative heart through music at vibrant festival\n3.\nSuriya unveils plans for closer Thailand-China railway link\n4.\nDSI\u2019s case against iCon Group execs ready for prosecution\n5.\nNew Year festivities expected to net over THB62 billion",

        "content": "World\nNew Cambodian PM set to take legacy of Beijing policy\nFRIDAY, AUGUST 11, 2023\nPlay\nOn Monday, Cambodian King Norodom Sihamoni endorsed army chief Hun Manet to succeed his father and long-serving prime minister Hun Sen as the country's leader after their Cambodian People's Party sealed a victory in the national election in July.\nForeign media and the diplomatic community will keep an eye on Cambodia's foreign policy to determine which direction the country is taking, especially its China policy, under the leadership of Hun Manet.\nSome commentators have said that the fact that Hun Manet studied at the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, and earned his PhD in economics from the University of Bristol, United Kingdom, suggests Cambodia's foreign policy may tilt toward the West. But the guiding principles of the country's foreign policy are not based on the leader's educational background but on Article 53 of the Constitution, which affirms Cambodia's commitment to permanent neutrality, non-alliance and peaceful coexistence.\nThe ruling Cambodian People's Party has set seven core principles for the next five years for the country's foreign policy, which include opposing force, disapproval of unlawful occupations, non-interference in the domestic affairs of other countries, prohibition of foreign military presence in Cambodia, and refusal to endorse invasions of other countries.\nAs a post-conflict nation, Cambodia attaches great importance to peace and stability, both domestically and regionally, and is committed to promoting development and prosperity and preventing any interference in its relations with other countries.\nChina is a major country that has always supported the Cambodian people's independent choice of development path, the path best suited to their national conditions, and backed them in defending Cambodia's sovereignty and national security. It also supports the Cambodian people in advancing their major domestic political agenda and socioeconomic development and opposing external interference in Cambodia's internal affairs.\nIn this context, Hun Manet is likely to maintain the current policy toward China, which is based on traditional friendship, mutual trust and win-win cooperation. And he is unlikely to change the policy of close cooperation between the ruling parties and governments of the two countries, strengthening the comprehensive strategic partnership of cooperation, and jointly building a high-quality, high-level and high-standard Cambodia-China community with a shared future for mutual benefit, thus contributing to peace, stability and prosperity in the region and beyond.\nHun Manet is also expected to continue socioeconomic reforms, including reforms in the education and healthcare sectors, increase trade and investment within the frameworks of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership and free trade arrangements, especially with China and the Republic of Korea.\nCambodia also has opportunities for opening up its economy through the Belt and Road Initiative, which identifies it as a transport and logistics hub between Vietnam, Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand and other Asean&nbsp;member states.\nIt also has opportunities for greater international exposure and using networks to boost trade and better safeguard national security through multilateral organizations such as BRICS, the New Development Bank and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. These organizations and institutions offer access to large networks for trade and investment, cross-border exchanges and security-related issues.\nAlso, cooperation on military training, equipment supply and combat readiness with China's People's Liberation Army will remain important, as will naval security over the Gulf of Thailand.\nWhile the \"old guard\" of Cambodia carries a lot of scars from the Cold War, the \"young leaders\" are faced with diminishing returns from the country's relations with Western economies, especially because, despite trade with the European Union and the United States rising over the past years, China remains Cambodia's largest trading partner and primary source of investment.\nHun Manet and his youthful new administration are well aware of the recessionary troubles afflicting both the EU and the US and know the economic incentives of maintaining close ties with China. Tourism is slow to recover from the impacts of the three-year Covid-19 pandemic, while Chinese investments are focused on sustainable, greener projects. That's why many officials in Phnom Penh now seek to diversify trade and investment toward sustainable value-added processing and manufacturing to meet the burgeoning needs of ASEAN's expanding middle class.\nDespite the post-pandemic effects, the spillover effects of the Ukraine crisis and recessionary trends in the EU and the US that have affected its housing, tourism and garment sectors, the Cambodian economy remains robust. High on Hun Manet's agenda will be issues such as building on Cambodia's RCEP and ASEAN membership and the FTAs with China and the ROK to continue his father's legacy of political stability and relatively high economic growth of 7 %&nbsp;a year during his term.\nThe comprehensive strategic partnership of cooperation, ironclad friendship, the building of a Cambodia-China community with a shared future and the hexagonal cooperation framework is the greatest legacy of Hun Sen in Cambodia-China relations, which Hun Manet needs to take forward. The healthy and stable relationship between China and Cambodia is both important and necessary to deepen practical cooperation in various fields.\nThe Cambodian People's Party's victory in the national election highlights the unchanged support of the Cambodian people for the party for three decades, creating a favourable situation for the party to run the government and implement the domestic and foreign policies without any hitch.\nKin Phea\nChina Daily\nThe author is the director-general of the International Relations Institute of Cambodia, Royal Academy of Cambodia and chairman of the Technical Committee of Political Science Terminology of the National Council for the Khmer Language.\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\nTAGS\nHun Manet\nCambodia\nChina\nBeijing\nPrime minister\nHun Sen\nRelated\nWill 6-day workweek for executives help Samsung avert crisis?\nApril 21, 2024\nMassive river flooding expected in China's Guangdong, threatening millions\nApril 21, 2024\nMyanmar general killed in drone attack near Thai border\nApril 21, 2024\nMOST VIEWED\n1.\nThaksin proposes ideas to develop Thailand's Northeastern region\n2.\nUncover Sisaket\u2019s creative heart through music at vibrant festival\n3.\nSuriya unveils plans for closer Thailand-China railway link\n4.\nDSI\u2019s case against iCon Group execs ready for prosecution\n5.\nNew Year festivities expected to net over THB62 billion",

The seminar, held at Hyatt Regency Bangkok, was organised by The Nation.\nSpeaking on the topic, \u201cThailand Trade Pulse 2023: New Thinking to Cope with Multiple Headwinds\u201d, Auramon said the global economy has been hit by several factors over the past three years, including the Covid-19 pandemic, geopolitical factors and climate change.\nHowever, the National Economic and Social Development Council (NESDC) expects the Thai economy to grow by 2.7-3.7% this year compared to 2.6% last year, she said.\nThe economic forecast has improved thanks to a recovery in tourism, private consumption as well as government and private investment.\nYet, she said, the Commerce Ministry expects Thai exports to expand by just 1% this year compared to 5.5% last year, due to rising interest rates, geopolitical situations and global economic slowdown.\nShe added that Thai exports in the first half of this year came in at US$141.17 billion (4.91 trillion baht), down 5.4% year on year. However, she said, Thailand\u2019s export market was still in a better condition than other countries like Japan, Malaysia, India, Indonesia and Vietnam.\n\u201cThai exports are doing better than many other countries thanks to the demand for agricultural products, tourism growth, relief in raw material shortage and the weakening baht,\u201d she added.\nShe expects Thai exports to recover gradually in the second half as many countries are still struggling to revive their economy, not to mention the Russia-Ukraine war and global warming.\n\u201cRelevant agencies in Thailand should work closely to help the country cope with these challenges,\u201d she said.\nProblems ahead\nShe said Thailand faces three key challenges in trade, namely geopolitics, sustainability measures and the Russia-Ukraine war.\nOn the geopolitics front, Auramon said Thailand is being hit because both the US and China have taken several protectionist steps to stimulate their economy.\nFor instance, the US is controlling the export of high-tech products to China, and is employing its Inflation Reduction Act to promote its domestic electric vehicle and batteries industries, she said.\nChina, meanwhile, has launched measures to strengthen its domestic market and reduce reliance on overseas markets. It has also launched the \u201cMade in China\u201d campaign to boost the production of semiconductors to support 70% of domestic demand by 2025.\nThese measures have caused supply chain polarisation, creating risks for Thailand as it has to carefully manage the supply chain, she said.\nHowever, she added, Thailand can also gain from supply chain polarisation, especially from the United States\u2019 Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity and China's Belt and Road Initiative.\nWindows of opportunity\nWith China\u2019s market share in the US dropping, Thailand has been able to slide in to gain a greater market share, especially in products like air-conditioning, hard disk drives, electronics and auto parts, she said.\nThailand is also gaining from foreign factories moving out of China, especially those in the electrical and electronic appliances and auto parts industries, she said.\nShe advised Thailand to closely monitor supply chain polarisation to attract investments.\nAs for eco-friendly trade measures, she said many countries have imposed restrictions based on their carbon neutrality and net-zero emissions goals.\nShe said that though this trend may pose challenges for Thailand, it also matches the country\u2019s policy and commitment to achieving sustainable development.\nHowever, she said, both public and private sectors must cooperate to deal with changes, such as the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, traceability and financial support.\nFor instance, she said, the European Union has launched 13 laws to work on sustainable development, especially the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), which aims to reduce inequality in greenhouse gas reduction.\nThis mechanism stipulates that importers of six product categories, namely aluminium, cement, iron and steel, electricity, hydrogen and fertilisers, must provide information on greenhouse gas emissions in the first three years, from October 1, 2023, to December 31, 2025, she explained.\nFrom January 1, 2026, importers will be expected to have CBAM certification based on their emissions.\nApart from CBAM, she said the EU has also launched an EU Deforestation Free Regulation (EUDR), which went into effect on June 29.\nThe regulation aims to ensure that the production of cow (beef), cocoa, coffee, palm oil, rubber, soybean and wood are traceable in a bid to reduce deforestation.\n\u201cEven though Thailand does not export many of the abovementioned categories, the Commerce Ministry has cooperated with government and private agencies to ensure that Thai entrepreneurs can cope with these measures,\u201d she said.\nAs for the Russia-Ukraine war, she said it has had an impact on the food and energy supply chain, as they are exporters of several products like fuel, natural gas, wheat, iron and steel.\n\u201cThailand is not too badly affected by the Russia-Ukraine war thanks to the agreement on exporting grain via the Black Sea between Turkey, Russia and Ukraine,\u201d she said.\n\"Thailand, however, should be cautious as Russia has withdrawn from the agreement causing difficulties in the supply chain in terms of global food production and manufacturing costs.\u201d\nFood security\nShe said the El Ni\u00f1o phenomenon must be monitored closely as many countries are taking steps to ensure food security. For instance, she said, India has suspended its export of rice to ensure there is enough for local consumption.\n\u201cThailand can use this as an opportunity to boost exports to countries with high demand for food,\u201d she said, adding that it can also help boost the price of Thai products.\nShe also advised Thailand to pay attention to developing innovative ways to tackle food shortage in the long term.\n\u201cThailand has to adapt to changes and seek cooperation to maintain competitiveness,\u201d she said.\nShe said that though the International Institute for Management Development (IMD) has ranked Thailand 30th globally for competitiveness, it should work towards boosting its competitiveness further.\nNew FTA negotiations\nThe Commerce Ministry is working on facilitating business, modernising law and regulations, maintaining old markets and penetrating new markets and boosting entrepreneurs\u2019 potential, she said.\nThe ministry is also cooperating with many countries to maintain trade and investment benefits, she added.\nThailand is working on new free trade agreements with many countries, including the United Arab Emirates, Sri Lanka, EU, Asean and Canada, she said.\nThe ministry is also negotiating FTAs with the Southern Common Market (Mercosur) comprising Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay, and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC).\nGCC comprises Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.\nShe said negotiating free trade accords poses a lot of challenges, but Thailand should be able to adapt to changes in the global trade situation and overcome them.\nTAGS\nDTN\nAuramon Supthaweethum\nThai exports\nImport\nGeopolitics\nRussia-Ukraine\nSustainability\nclimate change\nRelated\nThailand now world\u2019s 2nd largest exporter of canned/processed fish\nJuly 17, 2023\nOutlook for Thai exports growth revised downwards\nJuly 17, 2023\nIncreasing demand in China sweetens fruit export opportunities for Thailand\nJuly 11, 2023\nMOST VIEWED\n1.\nThaksin proposes ideas to develop Thailand's Northeastern region\n2.\nUncover Sisaket\u2019s creative heart through music at vibrant festival\n3.\nSuriya unveils plans for closer Thailand-China railway link\n4.\nDSI\u2019s case against iCon Group execs ready for prosecution\n5.\nNew Year festivities expected to net over THB62 billion",

        "content": "News\nThaksin proposes ideas to develop Thailand's Northeastern region\nFRIDAY, DECEMBER 20, 2024\nPlay\nFormer Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra delivered a speech titled \"The Future of Isaan: Opportunities for Thailand\" at Nakhon Ratchasima Rajabhat University on Friday, December 20, 2024. He outlined a vision for revitalizing the Isaan region (Northeastern Thailand) through education, technology, and economic reforms.\nThaksin emphasized the importance of setting clear goals and appointing leaders to drive progress, addressing a frequent lack of cohesive leadership in Thailand. \"The hardships and poverty have made Isaan people resilient and innovative. Now is the time to lift Isaan out of deprivation,\" he stated.\nHe highlighted Isaan\u2019s strengths, including its vast lands, large population, and rich cultural heritage, and proposed leveraging these assets through what he termed \"soft power.\" He stressed that development must begin with empowering Isaan\u2019s people.\nEducation as the Foundation\nThaksin called for a transformation in education, arguing that it must go beyond degrees to include practical knowledge and wisdom. He proposed creating a university focused on human development in Isaan, with an emphasis on integrating technology into daily life. \"Universities should play a central role in equipping Isaan people with the skills to adapt and thrive in a modern economy,\" he said.\nHe also suggested improving education through innovative methods, such as using lottery funds to send students abroad or hire foreign teachers for summer camps. Thaksin cited past successes, like model schools under his leadership, and proposed reviving such initiatives.\nAddressing Economic Inequalities\nThaksin criticized monopolistic practices and inefficiencies in industries like rice exports, where intermediaries control much of the market. He urged the government to maximize technology, enabling farmers to sell directly to international buyers via e-commerce platforms.\nHe also proposed modernizing OTOP (One Tambon One Product) initiatives by incorporating soft power strategies and AI knowledge. Thaksin envisioned universities as hubs for AI training, equipping Isaan residents with tools to compete in a global economy.\nTackling Public Debt and Regional Disparities\nThaksin addressed Thailand\u2019s high public debt, which exceeds 60% of GDP, limiting the government\u2019s ability to borrow for investment. He proposed issuing cryptocurrency-backed bonds directly to the public, channelling funds into the economy and boosting GDP growth from 2% to 4%.\n\"Isaan is the most drained region in terms of financial resources. Retail profits flow back to Bangkok, leaving the local economy underfunded. Issuing bonds tailored for Isan could empower the region by turning government debt into debt held by the people,\" he explained.\nCombatting Labor Migration\nThaksin expressed concern over labour migration, where Isaan\u2019s skilled workforce moves to Bangkok due to a lack of local opportunities. He proposed attracting talent back by fostering job creation and improving education within the region.\nFocus on Drug Abuse and Social Development\nThaksin highlighted the rising issue of drug abuse among youth and shared the Prime Minister\u2019s directive to combat it through targeted interventions. He emphasized that addressing societal challenges is critical for the holistic development of the region.\nTAGS\nisaan\nThaksin\nThaksin Shinawatra\nNakhon Ratchasima\nKorat\nRelated\nDSI\u2019s case against iCon Group execs ready for prosecution\nDecember 20, 2024\nNew Year festivities expected to net over THB62 billion\nDecember 20, 2024\nMore high-quality tourists expected from Poland as charter flights start\nDecember 20, 2024\nMOST VIEWED\n1.\nThaksin proposes ideas to develop Thailand's Northeastern region\n2.\nUncover Sisaket\u2019s creative heart through music at vibrant festival\n3.\nSuriya unveils plans for closer Thailand-China railway link\n4.\nDSI\u2019s case against iCon Group execs ready for prosecution\n5.\nNew Year festivities expected to net over THB62 billion",

The charges include fraud, violation of the Decree on Ponzi Schemes, the Direct Sales and Direct Marketing Act and the Computer Crimes Act.&nbsp;\nWatcharin Panurat, deputy director-general of the Office of the Attorney General (OAG)\u2019s Criminal Litigation Division, said the case will be divided into two parts. The first will involve filing charges against the 18 suspects for crimes committed against more than 7,000 victims within Thailand.\nThe second part involves victims outside Thailand, which requires further investigation before submission to the OAG.&nbsp;\nThe DSI contends that there is enough evidence to prove that the 18 iCon Group executives focused primarily on recruiting members for business ventures rather than selling products, a hallmark of Ponzi schemes.&nbsp;\nMeanwhile, Withoon Kengngan, the lawyer for the group\u2019s CEO Waratphol Waratvorakul, criticised the DSI for not being able to present clear evidence of wrongdoing from the very beginning. He said that for a fair trial, strong evidence should have been presented from the outset and this would have been crucial in fighting the case.&nbsp;\nHe added that he and his team would continue fighting the charges, and emphasised that they had sufficient evidence to support their case.&nbsp;\nAs for money laundering charges linking Waratphol to former Palang Pracharath Party member Samart Jenchaijitwanich, he said he was unconcerned and believes that the focus should remain on the main case for now.&nbsp;\nTAGS\nDSI\nThe iCon Group\nprosecution\nDEPARTMENT OF SPECIAL INVESTIGATION\nprosecutors\noffice\nRelated\nThaksin proposes ideas to develop Thailand's Northeastern region\nDecember 20, 2024\nNew Year festivities expected to net over THB62 billion\nDecember 20, 2024\nMore high-quality tourists expected from Poland as charter flights start\nDecember 20, 2024\nMOST VIEWED\n1.\nThaksin proposes ideas to develop Thailand's Northeastern region\n2.\nUncover Sisaket\u2019s creative heart through music at vibrant festival\n3.\nSuriya unveils plans for closer Thailand-China railway link\n4.\nDSI\u2019s case against iCon Group execs ready for prosecution\n5.\nNew Year festivities expected to net over THB62 billion",

Foreign tourist arrivals are estimated to reach 1.56 million, a 16% increase, generating approximately 45 billion baht in tourism revenue \u2013 a 20% rise.\n&nbsp;\nMajor contribution is also expected from the domestic market, with an estimated 4.41 million Thai visitors, a 29% increase. They will generate 17 billion baht in tourism revenue, a 30% rise year on year.\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\"We are incredibly optimistic about the tourism industry's performance during the upcoming New Year festivities. The projected growth of over 62 billion baht in revenue signifies a significant rebound and highlights the strong appeal of Thailand as a premier travel destination,\"\nThapanee said.\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\nSeveral factors are expected to fuel this growth. The \u201c\nEase of Travel\n\u201d measures, including visa exemptions for nationals of 93 countries and streamlined entry procedures, are expected to attract more foreign tourists.&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\nThe launch of at least 30 new flight routes from key markets such as China, South Korea, Taiwan, India, Scandinavia, and France will further enhance accessibility, the governor said.\n&nbsp;\nThailand's growing popularity as a New Year destination is also a significant driver. The country has been recognised by global media outlets such as Cond\u00e9 Nast Traveler, which ranked it among the \"\n20 Best Places to Go for New Year's Eve Celebrations Around the World\n\". Bangkok, Tokyo and Hong Kong were the only Asian cities on the list.\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\nThe Thai government has declared five days of public holidays from December 28 to January 1, 2025, providing a strong incentive for travel.&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\nTo address concerns about high airfares, the government is collaborating with six airlines to offer a 30% discount on popular tourist routes, including Chiang Mai, Chiang Rai, Krabi, Phuket, Samui, Udon Thani, Ubon Ratchathani, and Khon Kaen.\n&nbsp;\nThe cooler weather during the New Year period is expected to further encourage travel. Additionally, the \"\nAmazing Thailand Countdown 2025\n\" event, organised by TAT and its partners, will feature spectacular light displays, sound installations and cultural performances along the Chao Phraya River in Bangkok, creating a festive atmosphere for both domestic and international visitors.\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\nRelated\nThaksin proposes ideas to develop Thailand's Northeastern region\nDecember 20, 2024\nDSI\u2019s case against iCon Group execs ready for prosecution\nDecember 20, 2024\nMore high-quality tourists expected from Poland as charter flights start\nDecember 20, 2024\nMOST VIEWED\n1.\nThaksin proposes ideas to develop Thailand's Northeastern region\n2.\nUncover Sisaket\u2019s creative heart through music at vibrant festival\n3.\nSuriya unveils plans for closer Thailand-China railway link\n4.\nDSI\u2019s case against iCon Group execs ready for prosecution\n5.\nNew Year festivities expected to net over THB62 billion",

Airlines would be encouraged to operate more flights to Nakhon Ratchasima, he added.\nAircraft parking areas in Khon Kaen and Nakhon Phanom will be expanded to accommodate more aircraft. The ministry is studying extension of the runway at the Roi-Et and Loei airports to support large aircraft.\nThe government is ready to develop infrastructure in Thailand to connect the country to the world, as well as improve the quality of life among people in the Isaan region, he added.\n&nbsp;\nTAGS\nSuriya Jungrungreangkit\nTransport Ministry\nNORTHEAST\nhigh-speed rail\ndual-track\nroads\nmotorway\nairports\nquality of life\nrailway\nRelated\nEx-deputy PM Suwat outlines Isan\u2019s potential to drive Thai economy\nDecember 20, 2024\nHigh preference among Thais for vending machines: survey\nDecember 20, 2024\nThailand stands at a crossroads on journey to future growth: PM\nDecember 20, 2024\nMOST VIEWED\n1.\nThaksin proposes ideas to develop Thailand's Northeastern region\n2.\nUncover Sisaket\u2019s creative heart through music at vibrant festival\n3.\nSuriya unveils plans for closer Thailand-China railway link\n4.\nDSI\u2019s case against iCon Group execs ready for prosecution\n5.\nNew Year festivities expected to net over THB62 billion",

Of them, 28% purchase goods from vending machines every week and 13% purchase everyday.\nThe survey also showed that Thai consumers prefer buying goods from vending machines for convenience (72%), time saving (50%), ready-to-purchase goods (43%) and a variety of payment options (27%).\nMarket Buzzz CEO Grant Bertoli\nDespite challenges on locations, consumer preferences and available items, 58% of Thai consumers said they would continue purchasing goods from vending machines in the future.\nBeverages are the most popular items that Thai consumers purchase from vending machines (92%), followed by food and snacks (34%), and milk and dairy products (26%).\nThe survey also indicated that beverages like tea, coffee, soft drinks, juice and mineral water have become popular among Thai consumers from morning to noon.

However, the recovery pace remains slower compared to regions like the Middle East, where Qatar saw a remarkable surge in tourism following the 2022 World Cup, with foreign visitors increasing more than threefold compared to before the pandemic.\n&nbsp;\nIn 2024, Thailand anticipates about 35.7 million domestic tourists visiting man-made attractions, representing 17.9% of all local tourists. This includes approximately 22.2 million attending conventions and exhibitions, alongside 4.3 million for festive tourism and 9.2 million for amusement parks.&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\nMeanwhile, around 2.4 million foreign tourists are expected to engage in man-made tourism, 7% of the total foreign arrivals, indicating significant potential for growth in this sector.\n&nbsp;\nChamadanai Marknual\n, also a director of Business Risk and Macro Research at Krung Thai Bank, highlighted that man-made tourism aligns with the current trend of diverse experiences, including traditional activities, entertainment, and global conventions. By offering these attractions to foreign visitors, Thailand can enhance its tourist demographic.\n&nbsp;\nLooking ahead, Krungthai Compass estimates that the man-made tourism market could expand to 3.1 million foreign tourists by 2025, roughly 2.5 times the number in 2022, with contributions from MICE (Meetings, Incentives, Conventions, and Exhibitions) participants, amusement park visitors, and those attending festivals.&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\nThe projected average expenditure per \u201cman-made\u201d tourist is 58,300 baht per person per trip, significantly higher than other tourist segments, contributing 0.9% to GDP.\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\nKrittrin Laorit\n, an analyst at Krungthai Compass, pointed to successful international examples demonstrating the economic potential of man-made destinations. The Shanghai Disneyland project, for instance, received an investment of roughly 210 billion baht and generates 50 billion baht annually.&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\nSimilarly, the Qatar 2022 Fifa World Cup, with an investment of 490 billion baht, yielded around 68 billion baht in revenue during the event and contributed to long-term benefits through infrastructure development and enhanced global image.\n&nbsp;\nGiven these insights, Thailand has significant opportunities to harness man-made tourism for additional national income, particularly with innovative attractions and world-class mega-events.&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\nIt is essential for entrepreneurs to understand the diverse preferences of man-made tourists, especially younger generations such as Gen Z and Gen Y, who are increasingly drawn to unique, cross-cultural experiences that will shape the future of tourism.\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\nTAGS\nThailand\ntourism\nDestination\nRelated\nUncover Sisaket\u2019s creative heart through music at vibrant festival\nDecember 20, 2024\nChiang Mai unveils glory of old Lanna Kingdom at Wiang Kum Kam\nDecember 19, 2024\n37 free tent camping sites opened for New Year Festival\nDecember 19, 2024\nMOST VIEWED\n1.\nThaksin proposes ideas to develop Thailand's Northeastern region\n2.\nUncover Sisaket\u2019s creative heart through music at vibrant festival\n3.\nSuriya unveils plans for closer Thailand-China railway link\n4.\nDSI\u2019s case against iCon Group execs ready for prosecution\n5.\nNew Year festivities expected to net over THB62 billion",

        "content": "Women of the nation\n\u2018Lifelong learning and developing self-confidence vital to leadership\u2019\nFRIDAY, APRIL 05, 2024\nPlay\nInterview with Rungphech Chitanuwat\nOne of the successful women in the top management of the MICE and business events industry, with 19 years of experience to her credit, Rungphech \u201cRose\u201d Chitanuwat, director of the ASEAN Regional Group for Informa Markets Thailand, shares her thoughts on advancing women's leadership in business.\n&nbsp;\nWhat essential knowledge and skills do women need to prepare if they are to reach the top managerial level today?\nTo succeed in a leadership role, individuals must continuously learn and develop their skills, including practising leadership skills. Even if they are not currently in a leadership position, it's important to cultivate these skills for future roles. Key leadership skills include reliability, trustworthiness, communication, commitment, self-awareness and adaptability. Regardless of gender, building these skills is crucial for earning respect.\nAdditionally, women should focus on developing knowledge and self-confidence. By constantly practising and learning new things, confidence can be built over time.\nWhat are your principles for working and self-development that lead to success and acceptance of women's potential?\nI prioritise passion, determination, and clear goals in my work. I thrive in team environments and use empathy to lead and encourage others to seize opportunities for personal growth. I always strive to capitalise on opportunities that arise. I replicate what I have learnt and received in my career to ensure that I am building the next generation or even producing another me in my team.\n&nbsp;\nFor me, having great mentors is important. I am who I am today because of their support and the opportunity they gave me. Since I started my career in 1995, I have been mentored by both male and female supervisors at Informa, though there are differences in the way they mentored and coached me. But I\u2019ve learned it all and therefore, I\u2019d like to give this back to the generations to come.\nTransparent communication is crucial for effective leadership. Despite being based in Thailand, I successfully manage local and international teams, ensuring clarity in communication. Clear expectations, transparent communication, and trust are key to managing remote teams.\nFrom your perspective, what are the opportunities and challenges for women in business organisations?\nI firmly believe that as individuals, we are at our best and make our most valuable contributions when we are true to ourselves. Women, in general, excel at multitasking, attention to detail, empathy, flexibility, organisation, and stress management.\nNowadays, we see more and more women working in many industries. However, despite the opportunities, women are still openly discriminated against and compared to men, forced to face stereotypes that they are too emotional, risk-averse, indecisive, or aggressive, hindering their advancement in leadership. There is a need for more female role models in leadership to inspire the next generation.\nBeing a woman with ambitions for a leadership position, we must often seek sponsorship, mentorship, and demonstrate our own self-drive to succeed, supporting and building the next generation of women leaders.\nOne of the challenges many women face is balancing their roles at home as caregivers and their roles at work. Achieving work-life balance is a significant challenge for many women.\nHow do you propose to garner more support in pushing for gender equality and increasing the roles and rights of women in Thai society?\nIt is not about judging which gender you are, but rather recognising how individuals can contribute without gender bias. This is what we need in the workplace and in society. We should promote a more inclusive culture.\nI am trying to create an environment for women and men to raise awareness about the opportunities and challenges women face in the industry, and the need to elevate women to leadership roles. In the event industry, we promote diversity and inclusion by organising activities within events that highlight broader diversity, including race, gender, ethnicity, and sexual orientation. Examples include women's networking events, women's dinner talks, and women's sharing sessions. We believe that by understanding the intersectionality of diversity, we create opportunities to empower our members in the community to effect systematic change.\nWhat are your thoughts on the attitudes towards performance and work of the new generation of women?\nI think the most important attitudes the new generation should have are respect, integrity, and the ability to build trust. They have grown up with readily available technology and are often described as self-confident and ambitious, which can sometimes be perceived by the older generation as arrogance.\nThe new generation has different expectations in the workplace, such as their views on work-life balance, while the baby boomers, who mostly hold higher positions in today\u2019s workplace, focus on other aspects. These generational differences present challenges for leaders in managing intergenerational dynamics in the workplace.\nI would also like to encourage the younger generation to believe in themselves and have the confidence to seize any opportunities that arise, as well as to speak up and ask questions when they are unsure. Additionally, the new generation can learn from and emulate the positive examples set by their colleagues from previous generations.\nTAGS\nLearning\nleadership\nself-confidence\ndeveloping\nInterview\nMICE\nInforma Markets\nRelated\nThe Thai youth UN climate leader giving lessons in female empowerment\nMarch 29, 2024\nA Thai entrepreneur scores a win in Europe with her low glycemic flour\nMarch 25, 2024\nWhy female doctors are just as adept as men in management roles\nMarch 22, 2024\nMOST VIEWED\n1.\nThaksin proposes ideas to develop Thailand's Northeastern region\n2.\nUncover Sisaket\u2019s creative heart through music at vibrant festival\n3.\nSuriya unveils plans for closer Thailand-China railway link\n4.\nDSI\u2019s case against iCon Group execs ready for prosecution\n5.\nNew Year festivities expected to net over THB62 billion",

In rural areas, girls are the ones who have to drop out of school and help their family earn money,\u201d Aminta said.\nBelieving that education is the foundation for everything in life, Aminta launched a project to encourage girls to aspire to college or university as a way of discovering their passion and succeeding in life.\nMotivated by personal experiences\nHer experience as a volunteer teacher girls and young women in rural areas affected Aminta deeply.\nShe saw the impact education had in improving the livelihoods of people from underprivileged backgrounds.\nIn the rural schools where she volunteered, most girls came from impoverished farming families.\nWhen droughts or floods destroyed crops, they often skipped school to help their families secure income from other sources and put food on the table.\nBut Aminta liked to remind them of the long-term benefits of staying in education.\n\u201cIf you really invest in education and find your passion, then you can succeed and really become a productive and successful person,\u201d she said.\nAminta recalls that the idea of studying as the key to a better future made their eyes sparkle.\nThe girls realised that through education they could improve their social standing and \u201cbecome someone.\u201d.\n\u201cWhen they're empowered to really see the value of education and that it's not wasting their time, I can see this sparkle in their eyes when they look up at me,\u201d she said.\n\u201cI feel that I made a difference in this girl's life by making her see that education is important. And that if she carries on, she can become someone important.\u201d\nThe road to success\nAminta also offered advice for Thai girls, saying the most important thing was to have faith in themselves.\n\u201cI think that for any young girl or woman who wants to be successful, if you know what you want, then you can work for it.\n\u201cAs women, we are so resilient, and we have so much power in us; if we know what we want, we can work towards it.\u201d\nTAGS\nUN climate\nThailand Youth\nwomen empowerment\nAminta Permpoonwiwat\nU.N.\nactivism\nactivist\nclimate activists\nRelated\n\u2018Lifelong learning and developing self-confidence vital to leadership\u2019\nApril 05, 2024\nA Thai entrepreneur scores a win in Europe with her low glycemic flour\nMarch 25, 2024\nWhy female doctors are just as adept as men in management roles\nMarch 22, 2024\nMOST VIEWED\n1.\nThaksin proposes ideas to develop Thailand's Northeastern region\n2.\nUncover Sisaket\u2019s creative heart through music at vibrant festival\n3.\nSuriya unveils plans for closer Thailand-China railway link\n4.\nDSI\u2019s case against iCon Group execs ready for prosecution\n5.\nNew Year festivities expected to net over THB62 billion",

        "content": "Women of the nation\nA Thai entrepreneur scores a win in Europe with her low glycemic flour\nMONDAY, MARCH 25, 2024\nPlay\nSix years ago, Perada Suponpun came up with a simple way idea to make her foodie husband happy while keeping his weight down \u2013 bread made from flour with a near-zero glycemic index (GI). Today, Tasted Better, Perada\u2019s food tech startup, has just been successfully registered in Vienna, Austria, the first such startup to enter the European Union market.\n\" Back in 2018, my husband, Trai, weighed around 130 kilogrammes, which is excessive. I wanted him to stay healthy but didn't want to limit his enjoyment of food. So I suggested we try making bread without flour and sugar so that he could enjoy it without guilt,\u201d Perada, Tasted Better\u2019s CEO and co-founder, tells The Nation.\nTrai\u2019s initial reaction was to laugh at her crazy idea, but then thought about it more deeply and conducted additional research to explore the possibility. Together, they developed a functional flour with a glycemic index of nearly zero, possibly the lowest glycemic index available.\nAfter proving the potential of bread baked with their low GI flour by watching Trai\u2019s lose 30 kg in just 3 months, Perada decided to develop this flour as a business and Tasted Better was officially launched.\n\" Several new health and wellness trends were emerging at that time. So, I decided to produce low-GI bread and bakery products under the \u2018Dancing with the Baker\u2019 brand and sell them online,\" she said.\nAs the customer base grew, she realised that her ambition was no longer limited to bringing low-GI bread to the Thai market.\n\" I wanted people around the world to see that we, a Thai food tech startup, had developed a great innovation for those who really need it,\"&nbsp;she says.\nThe glycemic index is used to rank carbohydrate-containing foods based on how slowly or quickly they are digested and raise blood glucose levels over a set period, usually two hours.\nThe lower the number, the healthier the person is, allowing them to lose or maintain a healthy weight. And that makes Tasted Better products perfect for those who need to reduce their GI.\nTasted Better's Near Zero Glycemic Index Functional Flour was tested \"in vitro\"&nbsp;by the Institute of Nutrition, Mahidol University (INMU), which was designated as the Regional Centre and Regional INFOODS database centre in 1991.\n\" Tasted Better Flour's glycemic index (GI) is only at 1.6 which is almost equal to plain water,\"&nbsp;&nbsp;she said.\nThe flour, known as TB015, then underwent clinical trials in vivo by the Food Innovation and Packaging Centre, Chiang Mai University (FIN CMU).\nTB015's consistent glycemic response is potentially beneficial for individuals with diabetes or those aiming for stable energy levels.\n\" Tasted Better Flour can be used to make bread, croissants, pizza bases, pasta, noodles, and instant noodles that are flourless and sugar-free. Our product is appropriate for people who are trying to control their weight,\nhave dietary restrictions, or suffer from diabetes.\"\nHer efforts have paid off, as Tasted Better has now received awards from a variety of domestic and international agencies, including the Asian Association of Business Incubation (AABI), She Loves Tech, Vienna UP'23: The Startup Festival, and Youth Leadership from UN Women Asia-Pacific.\nTrai recently received the Entrepreneurs of the Year 2024 accolade from the Association of MBAs (AMBA) in London, marking a first for Thailand. AMBA is recognised as one of the top three global accreditation\norganisations in business education.\nTasted Better was also named one of 500 global food tech companies at 2023 FoodTech 500, the world's first definitive list of global entrepreneurial talent at the intersection of food, technology, and sustainability.\nIt is Thailand's second food technology company on the list, following Sesamilk.\nTo further strengthen the business, Perada says the company will continue to develop its products from flour to instant pasta with a longer shelf life and which meets the needs of the EU market.\nHowever, due to the start-up\u2019s limited capacity, Perada is planning to collaborate with several large food processing companies in Thailand and around the world to offer its low GI flour as a raw material for producing\ntheir own bread and bakery items for those in need.\nAcknowledging the support of both public and private agencies such as Space-F, Thailand's Global Food Tech Incubator and Acceleration Programme, in building, Tasted Better, Perada explains that several minors\ndetails and a trivial matter need to be resolved before they can proceed.\nShe used the company registration process for the City of Vienna as an example, stating that it took several months to officially launch Tasted Better due to the differences in backend financial banking systems between\nThailand and the EU.\n\" These never-ending issues consume our time and efforts. However, I have never been discouraged because I have one clear goal in mind: to see our Tasted Better products on market shelves in the EU and elsewhere around the world. I also want to show them they can expect innovative foods from Thailand,\"&nbsp;she said.\nTAGS\nThai entrepreneur\nwoman\nEurope\nVIENNA\nAustria\nThailand\nglycemic\nRelated\n\u2018Lifelong learning and developing self-confidence vital to leadership\u2019\nApril 05, 2024\nThe Thai youth UN climate leader giving lessons in female empowerment\nMarch 29, 2024\nWhy female doctors are just as adept as men in management roles\nMarch 22, 2024\nMOST VIEWED\n1.\nThaksin proposes ideas to develop Thailand's Northeastern region\n2.\nUncover Sisaket\u2019s creative heart through music at vibrant festival\n3.\nSuriya unveils plans for closer Thailand-China railway link\n4.\nDSI\u2019s case against iCon Group execs ready for prosecution\n5.\nNew Year festivities expected to net over THB62 billion",
