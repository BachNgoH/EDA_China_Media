During the implementation of the policy, all Chinese tourists visiting Thailand can enter the country without filling in the entry card.\nOn the same day, Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra said after concluding the cabinet meeting that the cabinet meeting approved the extension submitted by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to \"temporarily cancel the submission of TM.6 entry card for foreigners entering and leaving Thailand from 16 land and waterway inspection stations\" measures, from October 16th, 2024 to April 30th, 2025, for a period of 6 months.\nSince March 1st this year, the visa exemption agreement between China and Thailand has officially come into effect. Non-governmental and business exchanges between China and Thailand have gradually deepened, and the popularity of Chinese tourists visiting Thailand has increased, which has greatly promoted Thailand\u2019s economic recovery. During China's National Day holiday, in order to further attract Chinese tourists, the National Tourism Administration of Thailand launched the \"Hello Month\" activity, and organised special activities for Chinese passports in shopping malls, restaurants, spas and other places. Chinese tourists can enjoy discounts by showing their Chinese passports to cooperating shops with the \"Hello Month\" logo.\nThanks to the convenient entry policy and preferential policies, as of October 6th, the number of Chinese tourists visiting Thailand reached 5.25 million, ranking first in the number of overseas tourists received by Thailand. During the \"Golden Week\" of China\u2019s National Day, more than 160,000 Chinese tourists visited Thailand, an increase of 34% compared with the previous week. The number of direct flights from China to Thailand increased by 70% year-on-year, totalling 1,097 flights. The tourism consumption of Chinese tourists is expected to bring nearly 5 billion baht to Thailand, an increase of 120% over the same period last year.\nRELATED\nthailand\nMulti-family office to allocate over $120 million USD to its Thai and Southeast Asian Private Equity Platform, 9 Basil\nlife\nWhat 2019 brought to Thailand's strongest industry\nIt is reported that the \"cancellation of entry card\" policy approved by the Thai government this time was originally from July 21st, 2017 to October 15th, 2024, but now the period is extended from October 16th, 2024 to April 30th, 2025. This measure hopes to further promote tourism and stimulate the domestic economy by reducing the customs entry clearance process, and provide support for Thailand\u2019s economic recovery.\nThailand\u2019s Minister of Tourism and Sports, Solaon Tiantong, said that Thailand welcomes tourists from all over the world, especially Chinese tourists, and will make every effort to ensure the safety of tourists in Thailand, so that tourists can enjoy a safer and better travel experience.\nOn October 10th, Thailand's prime minister, during the east Asian cooperation leaders series meeting, offered warm congratulations on the 75th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. She noted that 2025 marks the 50th anniversary of China-Thailand diplomatic relations and said that Thailand is willing to celebrate with China, and promote further close exchanges and various fields of mutual benefit.\nAt the same time, the prime minister said that Thailand will continue to implement visa-free measures for China, increase the number of flights, enhance the chances for Chinese students to win scholarships, provide more convenience for tourists and business travellers, promote people-to-people exchanges and cooperation between the two countries, and continuously promote the building of a Thai-China community with a shared future. The prime minister said Thailand is ready to strengthen communication and coordination with China within multilateral frameworks such as ASEAN and Lancang-Mekong Cooperation, jointly promote trade and investment liberalisation and facilitation, and safeguard regional peace, stability and prosperity.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat is your budget range for renting a condominium?\nUnder 10,000 THB/month\n10,000 - 20,000 THB/month\n20,000 - 40,000 THB/month\n40,000 - 60,000 THB/month\nOver 60,000 THB/month\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nDo you like the content of this article?\n10\n36",

(Reuters photo)\nSeven takeaways from the Vientiane summit will lay the groundwork for boosting the incoming Asean chair's profile and deliverability. These impetuses mean Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim will have his work cut out in heralding a new era of \"Future Ready Asean\".\nIndeed, \"Future Ready Asean\" will be the new buzzword that will be vibrating throughout the region after the announcement of the Asean Vision 2045 in May of next year. Due to an extraordinarily volatile global landscape and pressing economic and social challenges on the home front, Asean is increasingly focused on strengthening centrality, integration, external relations, and overall preparedness.\nFirst, Asean needs a unified voice on geopolitics. During the retreat last week, the Asean leaders underscored the need to maintain a unified stance on global issues, especially those escalating tensions between global powers. As the US-China rivalry intensifies, the regional bloc must speak with one voice to safeguard its interests and relevance.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe inclusion of Timor-Leste's Prime Minister Xanana Gusmao, head of the world's youngest democracy, in the Asean retreat highlighted the bloc's commitment to reinforcing its geopolitical posture on critical concerns, including the East-West divide.\nAt 57, Asean can no longer avoid addressing geopolitical issues, particularly those involving international rules-based sovereignty and regional peace. Historically, Asean has pursued a balancing strategy in its relations with major powers like the US and China. But the growing competition between both threatens to pull the region into a tug-of-war. The Asean leaders are clearheaded and agree that Asean must stay neutral and be more assertive to avoid being trapped in this rivalry.\nRELATED\nopinion\nElon Musk and his US$2 trillion fiscal fantasy\nopinion\nRegional antidotes to counter Trump\nSecond, Asean's expansion must admit Timor-Leste as the 11th member next year. Since its independence in 1999, this small nation has expressed a strong desire to join Asean. President Ramos-Horta said his country would ideally become a full-fledged Asean member next year.\nTwo days before the country was admitted to the World Trade Organization (WTO) on Aug 30, Timor-Leste submitted a self-assessment to the Asean Secretariat. The diplomatic notes stated its readiness to accede immediately to the 66 Asean economic agreements listed in priority one. The other two comprise 48 agreements in priority two and 106 agreements in priority three, to which it will accede within two years and five years, respectively.\nSome Asean members want to defer the admission until all criteria in the roadmap are fulfilled, including capacity-building and human resources. That was understandable as they were not happy with Dili's instant emphasis on its democratic rather than its economic and other credentials to qualify for membership.\nHowever, including Timor-Leste will help Asean expand and reinforce its unity, adding to the bloc's political and economic strength.\nThird, Asean must further strengthen multilateralism and economic integration. By 2030, the Asean Community will become the world's fourth-largest economy. It is important that there should be deeper economic integration especially intra-trade among members. Between 2019-2023, intra-Asean trade averaged around 21.7%.\nTo strengthen supply chain resilience, Asean is upgrading its trade-in goods agreement to include digital trade, decarbonisation, and a circular economy. At present, the bloc's single window has integrated the national single window of the member countries.\nThe capacity of regional micro, small, and medium enterprises will be further enhanced as they generate 85% of employment and 18% of national exports. Asean is coming out with the Asean Digital Economic Framework next year, which will be the world's first such agreement.\nIn addition, the Asean-led Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), the world's largest free trade agreement, is expanding. Hong Kong, Sri Lanka, and Chile have applied to join the RCEP. Asean will soon complete the upgrade of Asean-China Free Trade Agreement 3.0. When they met recently in Vientiane, they could not conclude on the trade in goods and investment. They hope to round off the upgraded trade deal soon. India faces a similar challenge. Furthermore, Asean is in discussions with Canada on its first free trade agreement in North America.\nAsean will continue to upgrade its various free trade agreements with dialogue partners. The bloc's ability to adapt to the changing global economic environment will be crucial to sustaining its growth trajectory. Future-ready Asean needs multi-partnerships to improve domestic manufacturing capabilities and export higher-value products.\nFourth, Asean must engage and manage the US-China rivalry. No other bilateral ties impact Asean's well-being more than US-China relations. Any fallout from their competition could reverberate throughout the region. When the two superpowers were on good terms, Asean benefitted greatly, as both are important markets and sources of digital and green technology, moving beyond infrastructure projects.\nAs such, the bloc must position itself as a bridge between the two powers. Thailand's recent efforts in hosting the US-China meetings showed that Asean could play a constructive role in facilitating communication and easing existing tensions. One cardinal rule to which the Asean leaders consented is that Asean must resist taking sides in disputes, maintaining its strategic autonomy.\nFortunately, Asean's ties with both superpowers remain strong. Each member has its channels for engaging with the US and China, which is why their leaders consistently attend Asean's annual summits.\nFifth, Asean must continue its proactive engagement with Myanmar. The bloc's ultimate aim is to help the Myanmar stakeholders achieve peace and stability. It is imperative that Asean stays engaged with all conflicting parties, including dialogue partners. Of late, the State Administration Council has shown a willingness to negotiate with all resistance groups.\nAt the Vientiane summits, strong consensus has been made on the increasing role of the Asean Coordinating Center for Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Management (AHA Center) as well as the special envoys for Myanmar. The Five-Point Consensus (5PC) remains the central framework for restoring peace and stability in Myanmar, but progress has been slow since its inception in February 2021.\nThe Asean leaders also supported Thailand's initiative to have the so-called Asean Troika meeting in Bangkok in mid-December to further deliberate on humanitarian assistance plans and confidence building in Myanmar. This meeting will include foreign ministers from past, present, and future Asean chairs, as well as concerned dialogue partners with direct stakes in Myanmar's stability. Specialist UN agencies, such as the World Food Programme, Unicef, and the World Health Organization, will also get involved.\nSixth, Asean has its vision for 2045 as a long-term roadmap. The bloc has completed its long-term vision, encapsulated in the Asean Community's Vision 2045. This vision outlines the bloc's shared future for the next 20 years. All the action plans in the three pillars -- Political-Security Community, Economic Community, and Socio-Cultural Community will be completed in the first quarter of next year, and Malaysia will launch the vision 2045 and its strategic plan at the 46th summit in May.\nNext year also marks the 10th anniversary of the establishment of the Asean Community, which was also launched in Malaysia.\nSeventh, the Asean Outlook on the Indo-Pacific (AOIP) is the bedrock of regional architecture. It promotes a peaceful, open, and rules-based region, ensuring Asean's role as a key player in shaping the future of the Indo-Pacific. Since its announcement in 2019, Asean has been working hard to maintain its central role in the region's security. Regardless of its paucity, the AOIP will help Asean meet challenges.\nThe AOIP offers a way for Asean to avoid taking sides while still engaging with important partners like Japan, India, and Australia. These countries also have their Indo-Pacific strategies and they are aligned with the AOIP.\nFurthermore, Asean has expanded its comprehensive strategic partnership (CSP) to include South Korea this year and New Zealand next year as the seventh CSP. The bloc will continue to link up with key strategic partners who have their Indo-Pacific frameworks, ensuring that Southeast Asia does not become a pawn in the superpowers' geopolitical struggle.\nThese seven takeaways provide critical stepping stones for Asean's incoming chair. In addition, Mr Anwar minced no words in reiterating that Malaysia, as the Asean chair, will be active in engaging dialogue partners and other key regional players to promote Asean's voice and profile. During the handover ceremony, he said the chair will have dialogue and collaboration to champion an open, inclusive, and rule-based regional architecture.\nTo top it all, Malaysia has already identified four strategic thrusts for the chair's agenda namely enhancing trade and investment between Asean members; integrating and connecting economies; forging an inclusive and sustainable future, and transforming the digital future.\nBuilding on the results of the Vientiane summits together with Mr Anwar's stewardship and the new chair's strategic thrusts, Malaysia can guide the Asean's efforts to address pressing regional challenges while maintaining its centrality and further strengthening regional peace, stability, and prosperity.\nKavi Chongkittavorn\nA veteran journalist on regional affairs\nKavi Chongkittavorn is a veteran journalist on regional affairs\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhich app or platform do you usually use to book accommodations?\nBooking.com\nAgoda\nAirbnb\nTrip.com\nTraveloka\nExpedia\nSkyscanner\nDirectly with the accommodation\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nOpinion\nVientiane\nAsean\nMalaysian\nPrime Minister\nAnwar Ibrahim\nGeopolitics\nDo you like the content of this article?\n2\n14\nCOMMENT\n(2)",

(Reuters File Photo)\nLONDON - Britain said on Thursday that it would cede sovereignty of the Chagos Islands to Mauritius in a deal it said secured the future of the UK-US Diego Garcia military base, and which could also pave the way for people displaced decades ago to return home.\nUS President Joe Biden welcomed the deal, saying it would secure the effective operation of Diego Garcia, a strategically important and\nhighly restricted airbase\nin the Indian Ocean, into the next century.\nBut critics in Britain said it was a capitulation that played into the hands of China, which has close trade ties with Mauritius, while one group representing displaced Chagos Islanders expressed anger they had been shut out of talks.\nADVERTISEMENT\nAds powered by\nBritish Foreign Minister David Lammy said the deal settled the contested sovereignty of the islands, the last British overseas territory in Africa, while ongoing legal challenges had imperilled the long-term future of the Diego Garcia.\nRELATED\nworld\nUS military eyes Australia's Indian Ocean toehold to deter China\nsports\nThai stars gear up for battles in Paris\nHe said the base, whose strategic significance was

strengthen our role in safeguarding global security,\u201d Lammy said in a statement.\nBiden echoed that sentiment, saying Diego Garcia played \u201ca vital role in national, regional, and global security\u201d.\n\u201cIt enables the United States to support operations that demonstrate our shared commitment to regional stability, provide rapid response to crises, and counter some of the most challenging security threats we face,\u201d he said.\n\u2018Decolonisation\u2019\nBritain, which has controlled the region since 1814, detached the Chagos Islands in 1965 from Mauritius \u2014 a former colony that became independent three years later\u2014to create the British Indian Ocean Territory.\nIn the early 1970s, Britain evicted almost 2,000 residents to Mauritius and the Seychelles to make way for an airbase on Diego Garcia, the largest island, which it had leased to the United States in 1966.\nA non-binding resolution in the United Nations General Assembly in 2019 said Britain should give up control of the archipelago after wrongfully forcing the population to leave.\nIn 2016, Britain\u2019s Foreign Ministry extended Diego Garcia\u2019s lease until 2036, and declared the expelled islanders would not be allowed to go back.\nThe new agreement said Mauritius would be free to implement a programme of resettlement on the islands other than Diego Garcia, with the terms left for Port Louis to decide.\n\u201cWe were guided by our conviction to complete the decolonisation of our republic,\u201d Mauritian Prime Minister Pravind Jugnauth said in a televised speech.\nOlivier Bancoult, leader of the Mauritius-based Chagos Refugees Group, said it marked a decisive turning point and an official recognition of the injustices suffered by the Chagossians.\nBut British-based diaspora group Chagossian Voices said it deplored \u201cthe exclusion of the Chagossian community from the negotiations\u201d.\n\u201cChagossians\u2026 remain powerless and voiceless in determining our own future and the future of our homeland,\u201d it said in a statement on Facebook.\n\u2018Dangerous capitulation\u2019\nBritish Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who has said his government would be, in part, defined by a respect for international law after his Labour Party won power in July, had made settling the issue a priority.\nHowever, leading figures in Britain\u2019s opposition Conservative Party, which initially launched the talks while in government, criticised the agreement.\nConservative security spokesman Tom Tugendhat said the deal undermined Britain\u2019s allies and opened the possibility of China gaining a military foothold in the Indian Ocean.\n\u201cThis is a dangerous capitulation that will hand our territory to an ally of Beijing,\u201d Robert Jenrick, the favourite to be the next Conservative leader, said on X.\nDavid Blagden, associate professor of International Security and Strategy at Britain\u2019s University of Exeter, said the deal was a \u201cbig win\u201d for Mauritius.\n\u201cNot only will the UK pay Port Louis for \u2018taking back\u2019 an archipelago it\u2019d never held sovereignty over, but they\u2019ll now be able to extract

The expo now serves as an important platform for China and ASEAN member states to carry out further far-reaching economic and trade cooperation in more fields at deeper levels. For example, featured products including Vietnam\u2019s G7 Coffee, Malaysia\u2019s Musang King durians, Thailand\u2019s jasmine rice, and Laos\u2019 beer have entered the Chinese market over the years through the CAEXPO, which are well received by Chinese consumers.&nbsp;\nThe 21\nst\nCAEXPO, with higher quality and efficiency, will build more consensus, deepen mutually beneficial cooperation, and help build a closer China-ASEAN community with a shared future.\nJudging from the preparations, the exhibition will feature the following highlights and initiatives:&nbsp;\nFirst, add new content and showcase achievements of development. Pavilion of Strategic Emerging Industries will be added at this year\u2019s CAEXPO. Centering around fostering new productive forces in light of local conditions, it will showcase the latest developments and technical levels in emerging fields such as digital technology, green and low-carbon development, new energy, and intelligent connected vehicles. In addition, the new ASEAN High-tech Exhibition Zone will showcase high-tech achievements in industries such as massive health, biomedicine, new energy, and IT services from Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia, Cambodia and other countries, thus assisting ASEAN high-tech enterprises in developing markets in China and beyond.&nbsp;\nSecond, focus on pragmatic cooperation and show partners. For the first time, the CAEXPO will invite Gulf countries to participate in the expo, with the United Arab Emirates as a special partner. A delegation of U.A.E. buyers will participate in the expo. For the first time, the members of Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) will be invited to participate in the expo as a whole, and featured products from Kazakhstan and other SCO countries will be unveiled. Enterprises from other RCEP member countries such as Australia and Japan, as well as countries relevant to the Belt and Road Initiative such as Poland, Serbia and Brazil will also participate in the expo.&nbsp;\nRELATED\nbusiness\nGovt eyes Guangxi region trade boost\nthailand\nVisit CAEXPO for Thai Food\nThird, provide better market services and expand platform functions.

The additional day is the open day for the public, so that enterprises can be better oriented to the market and the general public can better feel the results of pragmatic cooperation between China and ASEAN member states. At the same time, we optimize the online CAEXPO, set up a permanent exhibition hall, and coordinate the online and offline exhibition and economic &amp; trade activities during and off the exhibition period that take place inside and outside the exhibition halls, so that the Expo with more service functions stays open throughout the year.&nbsp;\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat is your budget range for purchasing a condominium?\nEkkamai-Thong Lor\nSathorn-Silom\nChidlom-Siam\nBang Na\nChinatown\nAri\nRiverside\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nCAEXPO\nDo you like the content of this article?\n1\n0",

Her father, Thaksin, wasted no time recapturing the spotlight, positioning himself as the Nostradamus who knew everything just days after her official appointment. His demeanour and words have reminded all Thais of the dangers inherent in dynastic politics. Will it impact her ability to govern independently and effectively?\nThaksin could not hide his exuberance over his daughter's rise. He treated her new position as a personal trophy of the Shinawatras rather than a victory for the Thai people. That should not surprise anyone, given Thaksin's long history of wielding power and influence in Thai politics. Seventeen years in exile has actually hardened his political instincts and vengeance.\nHowever, before the official government policy announcement, his overt engagement in Ms Paetongtarn's perceived role raises serious questions about her leadership. A similar question that was asked to former prime minister Srettha Thavisin has also resurfaced. Is Ms Paetongtarn truly at the helm, or is she merely a figurehead, with Thaksin pulling the strings behind the scenes? In his past year in office, Mr Srettha proved little more than a figurehead himself.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThaksin's public appearances during last week's dinner talk, where he shared his vision on the stage, underscore the troubling dynamics at play. As it turned out, he talked and answered questions for over two hours and seemed to be blissfully basking in the media limelight. He literally just gave a comprehensive roadmap for Ms Paetongtarn's government.\nFor the past week, Thaksin and Ms Paetongtarn have been trying to play down their relations by presenting their dynamic as father-daughter relations and promising there would not be krom-ngum or krom-krong, meaning \"dominate\" or \"control\". Ms Paetongtarn reiterated that she \"can think for herself\". At the talk, Thaksin said it was his duty to help his daughter with ideas and suggestions. Ultimately, he professed that the decisions lie with Ms Paetongtarn and her cabinet. Will she or can she be swayed off track?\nRELATED\nbusiness\nGovt sizes up Thailand's growth outlook\nopinion\nCourt ruling emboldens Pheu Thai\nOnly time will tell if this blurring of family and political lines is a mere illusion. Otherwise, it could be a fault line undermining her newly formed government. Most importantly, it would seriously endanger the country's fabric of democratic governance.\nIn the coming weeks, Ms Paetongtarn will face a series of formidable tests for her leadership. She must form a new coalition government, deliver a policy speech in parliament, and represent Thailand on the international stage at several meetings.\nThe postponement of the Bay of Bengal Multi-Sectoral Science Technology and Economic Cooperation (Bimstec) summit, scheduled for Sept 3-4 in Bangkok, points to the diplomatic uncertainties she faces. It also delayed Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's official visit to Thailand, which was to precede the Bimstec summit. These developments show that she has yet to establish her authority and readiness to manage the challenges of international diplomacy.\nWith the 79th United Nations General Assembly set to kick off in the middle of next month, Ms Paetongtarn must decide whether to attend and introduce herself to the global community in New York as Asia's youngest female prime minister. Indeed, she has an excellent opportunity and platform to demonstrate that she is more than just Thaksin's daughter. She can show she has what it takes to lead today's Thailand.\nThe overseas challenges will continue into October, when she is scheduled to attend the double 44th and 45th Asean-related summits in Vientiane, Laos. These gatherings of nearly 20 global leaders will be imperative to establish her credibility in the region and beyond. Leaders from Asean members, China, Japan, South Korea, India, the US, Russia, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Timor Leste, and the United Nations will converge at the summits. Later, Ms Paetongtarn will also have to visit other Asean member countries.\nAnother big test that awaits her is the crisis in Myanmar. Former prime minister Srettha did not pay Myanmar the attention it deserved; he was seen pushing forward his business agenda and throwing a series of \"roadshows\".\nWith the worsening situation in Myanmar, the new government needs to recalibrate the country's policy toward this neighbour. Earlier this year, Thaksin, even wearing a paroled prisoner hat, tried but failed to craft a role as a peace broker when he approached ethnic armed rebels.\nThe situation on the western front has already impacted Thailand's border security and stability. Without clear and comprehensive policies and action plans, the Thai-Myanmar border is considered a time bomb with the continued influx of irregular migrants and active transnational crime syndicates.\nThaksin's return to Thai politics has already reignited his vast network and influence in more ways than one. His long wishlist concerning his vision for Thailand will likely continue to shape Ms Paetongtarn's agenda. This situation is risky for her due to Thaksin's political power and manoeuvring.\nIt is doubtful that the prime minister can rein in her super dad. Her premiership could be short-lived if she fails to stay independent and maintain her stewardship. For the time being, Thaksin has been skilful in masquerading his multiple roles as a father, an adviser, a de facto party leader, and a former prime minister whenever he sees fit.\nMs Paetongtarn's future still faces unpredictable challenges emanating from her cabinet members, of whom she has very little knowledge. It will be difficult for her to run the government and keep the cabinet members in check on her own.\nFinally, Thaksin's craving for publicity could also unintentionally overshadow her presence. As such, she must find a way to balance his influence with her style of leadership. The omen of dynastic politics looms large. Thailand's future is on a precipice.\nKavi Chongkittavorn\nA veteran journalist on regional affairs\nKavi Chongkittavorn is a veteran journalist on regional affairs\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat is your budget range for renting a condominium?\nUnder 10,000 THB/month\n10,000 - 20,000 THB/month\n20,000 - 40,000 THB/month\n40,000 - 60,000 THB/month\nOver 60,000 THB/month\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nPaetongtarn\nDynastic politics\nThaksin\nDo you like the content of this article?\n130\n28\nCOMMENT\n(33)",

Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese did not attend the meeting, instead represented by his deputy.\nChina is an ever-rising concern to many within Nato and beyond, not least because of what US and other allied officials say is Beijing's increasing support for Russia in Ukraine, delivering a growing number of critical components for Russian weapons systems, if not yet lethal weaponry itself.\n\"We must not forget that today the PRC [People's Republic of China] is the largest enabler of Russia's war against Ukraine through the provision of dual-use goods,\" Nato Director of Policy Planning Benedetta Berti told an event at think-tank The Atlantic Council last Monday.\nChina could not expect to be treated as a responsible member of the international community while doing that, she added.\nAfter the leak of a draft of the Nato summit communiqu\u00e9 that used similar language, Chinese officials responded furiously.\n\"As we all know, China is not the creator of the crisis in Ukraine,\" a Chinese foreign affairs ministry spokesman said, describing the draft Nato declaration as \"full of Cold War mentality and belligerent rhetoric\" and the China-related content as \"full of provocations, lives, incitement and smears\".\nExactly how Nato might engage itself in Asia is a subject of no little disagreement -- at last year's conference in Vilnius, French President Emmanuel Macron vetoed an otherwise widely-backed proposal to open a small alliance office in Japan.\nWhile supporters of that proposal say it is important to keep Nato directly involved in major global security issues, including in the Pacific region, others -- most particularly France -- argue such activity risks being a distraction from Nato's core task of defending Europe.\nThis year, Chinese officials have become much more vocal in their opposition to Nato conducting any Asia-facing work.\n\"It is necessary to resist the negative impact of the Indo-Pacific strategy and guard against Nato reaching out to the Asia-Pacific,\" Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told Thai counterpart Maris Sangiampongsa last Tuesday.\nAn alliance that began with 12 members in 1949 and now includes 30 European nations plus the United States and Canada, Nato's founding North Atlantic Treaty declares that an attack on one member is an attack on all.\nThat promise is explicitly limited to the North Atlantic region, although the alliance has already occasionally operated \"out of area\" including during conflicts in Afghanistan and Libya.\nSpeaking in Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lian Jian responded to a question on the Nato summit by saying China's stance on the alliance remained \"consistent\".\n\"We firmly oppose Nato acting beyond its characterisation as a regional defence alliance, inserting itself into the Asia-Pacific to incite confrontation and rivalry and disrupting the prosperity and stability in this region,\" he said.\nIn reality, few of the discussions in Washington this week revolve around Nato \"expanding\" to include Asia, certainly not through bringing in potential Asian members such as Japan, South Korea or the Philippines.\nAll of these countries have their own mutual defence deals with the US already, plus other, ever-deepening multinational relationships, all spurred by mounting worries over China.\nTaiwan, recognised by most nations as part of China but functioning as a de facto independent state, has its relations with the US government under the US-Taiwan Relations Act, which has always left \"strategically ambiguous\" whether Washington would defend the island, though President Joe Biden has more recently said several times emphatically that it would.\nAt the end of January, the US military headquarters in Europe at Ramstein Air Base in Germany held a Nato conference explicitly aimed at stopping Chinese efforts to recruit former allied military pilots and other aircrew to train Beijing's military as contractors.\nUS officials warned that some of those efforts included recruitment by front companies that did not declare their links to China's military.\n\"Increasingly, partners in Europe see challenges ... in Asia as being relevant to them, just as partners in Asia see challenges halfway around the world in Europe is being relevant to them,\" US Secretary of State Antony Blinken told the Brookings Institution think-tank last week.\nHowever, there will have been no shortage of voices in Washington this week warning Nato's European members that they cannot afford to get too sidetracked by thinking about Beijing.\nIndeed, insiders say one of the purposes of the classified \"Nato Secret\" session with Asia-Pacific leaders was to convince the Europeans the risk of war in Asia is now very real -- and that with the US now increasingly focused on the China threat, Europe must do more to defend itself.\nSuch views may be voiced most loudly by those competing for places in a future Donald Trump administration, but they are shared by many within the Biden team as well.\nThe worst-case scenario, officials in Washington, Brussels and above all Eastern Europe increasingly believe, is that what both sides now call the \"no limits\" partnership between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping one day prompts Beijing to encourage Moscow to launch a limited land grab against exposed Nato nations such as the Baltic states.\nSuch a move could leave US forces struggling to simultaneously confront Russia and China on opposite sides of the world -- and make it much easier for China to achieve potential military ambitions, including a Taiwan invasion.\nOthers, however, suggest the Russia-China partnership may already be showing its limits.\nFor all the diplomatic smiles, however, Moscow and Beijing are also effectively competitors for influence across Central Asia and beyond. Russian troops do not appear to have been invited to the China-Belarus drills currently underway.\nThe world is getting more complicated. Nato appears to have decided it cannot ignore events in the Pacific. China, for its part, is signalling that it also views the European continent as part of an increasingly contested planet.\u2009REUTERS\nPeter Apps is a writer on international affairs, globalization, conflict and other issues.

This water infrastructure projects Cambodia as a viable and dynamic little tiger, no longer a war-torn nation. Under Prime Minister Hun Manet's leadership, Cambodia is taking a more proactive stance overall despite facing objections from neighbours like Vietnam that stand to bear the direct impact of this naval logistics scheme.\nWhen finished, the 180km waterway -- 100 metres in width and 5.4 metres in depth -- will connect Phnom Penh Autonomous Port with the Kep coastline at the Gulf of Thailand, Currently, Cambodia relies heavily on using Vietnamese ports for maritime transport, notably that of Cai Mep. The new canal would significantly reduce this dependency, as Cambodian ships now can completely bypass Vietnamese territory.\nLet us be clear: Vietnam-Cambodia relations are very deeply entrenched, and their top echelons are still very closely connected. Their disagreements and anxiety on any issue can only go so far as they still treasure their brotherly relations. As the Khmer Times' editorial recently put it: The Cambodia-Vietnam relationship exemplifies a resilience and dynamic partnership that has withstood the test of time.\nADVERTISEMENT\nAfter all, the current Vietnamese leadership worked together in the security and intelligence fields with their Cambodian counterparts under former prime minister Hun Sen's stewardship. He has also witnessed his Vietnamese colleagues rising through the rank and file over the past four decades.\nFor Vietnam, ties with Cambodia also pivot on its bamboo foreign policy. With a common land and maritime border, both countries need cooperation, not contestation. It is not surprising that new Vietnamese President To Lam is scheduled for a two-day official visit to Cambodia in the coming days after his stopover in the Lao PDR, the current Asean chair.\nRELATED\nworld\nHopes rise for giant catfish revival in Cambodia\nbusiness\nOR eager to sell shares of underperforming businesses\nThe $1.7 billion plan, proposed in May, which aims to connect the Mekong River to Cambodia's coast, has stirred up attention and debate. While Cambodia has remained resolute in moving ahead with the canal, Vietnam has expressed concerns over the potential environmental and economic impacts. So far, other lower riparian countries -- Myanmar, Laos and Thailand -- have been mute over the controversy.\nAs a strategic infrastructure project, the canal will enhance Cambodia's connectivity and reduce reliance on Vietnamese water and ports. Most importantly, it also serves as a signature to former prime minister Hun Sen's legacy. His son, Hun Manet, has described the canal as \"breathing through our own nose\", reflecting his country's aspirations for greater strategic autonomy.\nTo reinforce its determination, Cambodia will celebrate the groundbreaking of the construction site this upcoming Aug 5, which is also the birthday of Hun Sen who has asked the citizens to make noise and organise fireworks displays to mark the occasion. He has also requested pagodas to beat drums to celebrate the auspicious ceremony.\nHalf of the 1.7 billion USD project will be invested by he China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC) under a BOT (build-operate-transfer) contract.\nIndeed, the timing of the construction announcement is very significant as the nascent Manet cabinet has been trying to make its meaningful traction after Hun Manet assumed the prime minister position in September last year. In addition, Cambodia is charting a new course that is more closely aligned with Western countries while maintaining excellent ties with China, Japan, and South Korea.\nThe recent visit by US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin was a case in point. It also signals a shift in US engagement with Cambodia, which has long been neglected due to human rights issues. However, Hun Sen, now President of the Cambodia Senate, is guiding Hun Manet, who graduated from the prestigious US cadet school West Point, to maintain balanced relations with all major powers.\nSince the end of the Cambodian War in the late 1970s, the country has risen from the ashes of deadly conflicts. Now, it has new ambitious plans to build a higher middle-income nation with high technological advancement. It has claimed that its financial sector has adopted the full range of fintech to help build the country up as one of the region's financial hubs.\nAs a lower Mekong riparian country, which controls the southern mouth of the Mekong, Vietnam has repeatedly requested more information and impact assessments, expressing concerns about potential environmental damage and disruptions to water flows. However, Cambodia insists the project will not harm the Mekong. Vietnam's concerns are multifaceted. The country fears the canal could disrupt water flows to the Mekong Delta and its rice basket and impact shipping revenues from trade with Cambodia. In a later case, Phnom Penh argued that given the proximity to Vietnam, its overall economy would benefit from trade, logistics and economic cooperation.\nAccording to Chheang Vannarith, a much-credited political analyst, co-founder and vice-chairman of the Cambodian Institute for Strategic Studies, officials from both countries at various leadership levels have discussed and exchanged views on their concerns. Their mutual understanding has improved. He reiterated that this project is a \"Cambodian-led\" initiative yet thought that the proposed fund of 1.7 billion was too small. Other Cambodian scholars have also rallied behind the plan, but questions remain about long-term feasibility and funding. Additional and diversified funding from local sources and abroad is needed, not just from China.\nThere are also geopolitical worries, as the canal is near the Ream Naval Base. Vietnam and other countries have raised the issues of China's influence, as it is providing funding. Interestingly, during Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh's recent visit to Beijing, their joint statements pledged to further deepen the China-Vietnam comprehensive strategic cooperation partnership and build a community with a shared future that carries strategic significance. China also pledged to help improve Vietnam's connectivity capacity, especially large-scale transport infrastructure for high-speed trains, railways, roads, and border crossings. These have also been similar requests from Cambodia. At the top level, the common interests among these three countries must be aligned. Both Vietnam and Cambodia support China's concept of a community with a shared future.\nTo mitigate tensions and reduce any deficit of trust, former Cambodia's secretary of state at the Foreign Affairs Ministry Pou Sothirak, a distinguished senior fellow at the Cambodian Centre for Regional Studies, posited that increased dialogue, sharing of technical details and cross-border cooperation among riparian states is crucial to addressing shared challenges and reducing the potential for future conflicts. He urged Cambodia to work closely with the Mekong River Commission (MRC) -- an \"...inter-governmental organisation that works directly with the governments of Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, and Vietnam to jointly manage the shared water resources and the sustainable development of the Mekong River\". Calling in a win-win approach, the MRC can help with the technical inputs and identify potential boundary risks early\nAs Cambodia flexes its muscles and asserts its ambitions, the canal is a litmus test for Hun Manet's leadership and his country. The project's success or failure could shape Cambodia's regional influence and relations with its neighbours in the coming years and decades.\nKavi Chongkittavorn\nA veteran journalist on regional affairs\nKavi Chongkittavorn is a veteran journalist on regional affairs\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat type of house are you most interested in?\nSingle-family home\nTownhouse\nSemi-detached house\nVilla\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nCambodia\nEconomy\nCompetitiveness\nDo you like the content of this article?\n32\n77\nCOMMENT\n(5)",

This shortage forced many patients to postpone surgeries and/or medical treatments, which affected their life.\n&nbsp;\nADVERTISEMENT\nTo encourage young people in good health to donate blood to the Thai Red Cross Society, Pop Mart Thailand launched \"Pop Blood Giver Campaign\" earlier this year. From this campaign, the Thai Red Cross received 8,139 units of blood. The campaign gained the attention of young people since each donor received a \"blind box\" art toy from Pop Mart as a token of appreciation.\nIt is a well-known fact that Pop Mart is one of the most popular art toy brands among young people. Renowned for its blind boxes featuring diverse characters, Pop Mart has collaborated with global brands such as Disney, Sanrio and Warner Bros, as well as celebrated designers like Kenny, Pucky and Kasing Lung, to launch a variety of pop culture-inspired products.\nDue to the excellent response, Pop Mart Thailand organised \"Pop Blood Giver Campaign Season 2\" to once again invite target donors to make merit with the Thai Red Cross Society. The second campaign ran last month at the National Blood Center, the Thai Red Cross Society on Henri-Dunant Road.\nThroughout the year, Pop Mart Thailand plans to donate 40,000 blind box art toys worth 5.6 million baht to blood donors. In the first season, 2,500 blind box art toys were distributed to donors and 8,500 blind box art toys in the second instalment. In future, the project will expand to Thai Red Cross Blood Centers in 12 provinces nationwide including Lop Buri, Nakhon Ratchasima, Chiang Mai, Songkhla and Phuket.\nFrom left, Jeremy Lee, Justin Moon and Siriporn Plangchatuk. Pop Mart (Thailand)\nJustin Moon, president of Pop Mart International, visited Bangkok for \"Pop Blood Giver Campaign Season 2\". The Korean executive was thrilled with Pop Mart's charity campaign and Moon plans to expand the campaign to other countries and seek assistance from the Thai Red Cross Society to reach out to Red Cross organisations in other nations.\nDespite being delighted with the campaign, Moon was disappointed that he could not participate in the blood drive because, according to a requirement by the Thai Red Cross Society, donors must be people who have stayed in Thailand for one year. As a Korean citizen, Moon shared that the South Korean government supports blood drives through many activities which encourages young Koreans to donate blood.\n\"I started donating blood when I was 18. Donors would receive a free movie ticket or a book as well as a small certificate to certify their good deed. When hiring, companies often select candidates who have a background of giving back to society or helping others. These benefits encourage young people to participate in blood drives. Additionally, men who have participated in military service have to donate blood while serving in the military. There are also blood donation buses that operate nationwide, so people have easily access to donation locations,\" he said.\nIn Thailand, Pop Mart is a popular art toy brand among collectors. In September last year when Pop Mart opened its first branch in CentralWorld, a long queue formed early in the morning before the store opened. Some products sold out within a few hours. Last month, after Blackpink's Lisa posted a photo holding Labubu Macaron on her Instagram, the character became very popular. It is one of Pop Mart's Monster collections created by Kasing Lung, an artist from Hong Kong. Due to Lisa's popularity, the price of Labubu increased by a significant amount and sold out.\n\"We never sent any art toy to Lisa, but we were lucky that someone bought Lisa a Labubu Macaron and she made the product popular with her Instagram photo. This is just the beginning. Pop Mart will gain more popularity in the future.\"\nBlood donors at 'Pop Blood Giver Campaign Season 2' by Pop Mart.\nAfter Pop Mart experienced the K-pop soft power boost, does the company have any plans to collaborate with Korean stars?\n\"We have received many requests regarding Korean sensations, but at this time, we would like to conduct surveys secretly because many fandoms are watching us. Since creating art toys inspired by celebrities can be an advantage or a disadvantage, we need to be cautious about this,\" said Moon.\nPop Mart was first launched in Beijing, China, in 2010. The company later expanded to over 500 stores in 30 countries such as the US, New Zealand, Australia, France, Germany, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and South Korea. In Thailand, six branches launched in Bangkok in the same year.\nAccording to Moon, people at  headquarters in Beijing come up with marketing plans. Since each country has a different demand, headquarters will talk with different branches to develop and enhance products to match the different preferences of each country being targeted.\n\"Since each country has a different language, culture and religion, Pop Mart has to localise its products. For example, in Islamic countries, some restrictions make it impossible to sell certain characters. Headquarters speaks to local offices to learn the restrictions and adjust the products accordingly.\"\nThailand also recently launched a special collection that may not be able to sell in some countries. Thaphatkorn Dulgaiphan, head of marketing, Pop Mart Thailand, explained that in June, Thailand launched a collection called Crybaby Pride Parade Figurine for Pride month. Designed by Thai artist Nisa Srikumdee, the figurine appears in the colour of the rainbow to represent the LGBTI community.\n\"Thailand is one of the biggest hubs of the LGBTI community and Pop Mart is a supporter of Pride parade every year. This collection is to express that Pop Mart believes in inclusivity. We accept everyone, including the LGBTI community,\" said Thaphatkorn.\nBlood donors receive a Pop Mart blind box.\nThe art toy market has grown rapidly. Some collectors adore their collections while some turn it into a profit-making investment. Are art toys just a trend or can they be long-term products?\nJeremy Lee, the go-to-market director of Southeast Asia of Pop Mart, said that he believes there is no everlasting product.\n\"I don't think any product is forever. I think the key is knowing where the trend is going and how we can figure out who's buying our products and adapt according to the trend. After the Covid-19 pandemic, new shopping behaviours have evolved, so we have to move with the times. The core of the brand is innovation and creativity. We have to know who are the consumers and get a good sense of what they like and then go with that,\" he said.\nMoon believes that Pop Mart can be a part of collectors' lives.\n\"In my opinion, culture is something that remains the same, but the trend always changes. It depends on people's attitude towards art toys. It can be that people buy art toys because it is the in thing to do, or that people buy art toys out of love and a desire to collect them. I don't want to think that art toys are a temporary trend. They can be adjusted to be part of the culture and routine lives of collectors.\"\nPop Mart (Thailand)\nThe Crybaby Pride Parade Figurine.

Without revitalising the collective spirit backed by action, the survival of humanity could be at risk.\nOver the past several years, our planet has been through many tribulations -- the Covid-19 pandemic, an ongoing conflict in Europe between Russia and Ukraine, wars and humanitarian crises in the Middle East, Myanmar and African countries, not to mention climate change. New technological advancements such as artificial intelligence (AI), cyberspace, and space technology also pose threats to international order and global trade.\nAll these contemporary challenges show that the world needs a more efficient international rules-based multilateral system. Topics on this matter will be discussed in \"The Summit of the Future: Multilateral Solutions for a Better Tomorrow\" -- a United Nations summit in New York on Sept 22-23. The summit has already been dubbed a \"once-in-a-generation opportunity\" to effect global change in ways that would promote solidarity among the international community and all citizens without leaving anyone behind.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe meeting is expected to provide action plans and solidify collaborations for countries to achieve UN Sustainable Development Goals, which has a deadline of 2030, something that is still found wanting, with only 15% of SDGs being on track.\nAt the summit, national leaders will sign the \"Pact for the Future\", prepared by Germany and Namibia early this year. On May 15, the latest revised draft was circulated for comments. It contained 52 actions under five key chapters touching on sustainable development, peace and security, science and technology, youth and future generations, and global governance. Currently, the draft is being negotiated by UN members.\nAs an active member of the UN, Thailand views the upcoming summit as an opportunity to share some of its best practices and lessons learnt from national and regional experiences. Thailand has contributed ideas and cooperation towards the five chapters outlined by the pact to boost UN authority and the multilateral system.\nThis time around, Thailand wants to do more. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has already held a consultative meeting with stakeholders, including marginalised groups, to gather their input. The meeting's deliberations and outcome will be incorporated and become part of the country's positions and contributions during the summit.\nThe newly appointed Thai permanent representative to the United Nations, Cherdchai Chaivaivid, told the Bangkok Post that the success of the summit would depend on innovative solutions to emerging global challenges. He reiterated that the \"Pact for the Future\", which will be the outcome document signed by the leaders of UN members in September, must be ambitious and visionary, reflecting the views of all countries and stakeholders with a broad consensus. \"Recommended actions must also strengthen the multilateralism system and promote the implementation of existing commitments,\" he added.\nJudging by the country's involvement with various global issues under UN frameworks, Thailand has a lot to say on issues related to sustainable development, sufficiency economy philosophy, global health, peace and security, and climate change, among others. Although the country's records on these endeavours are not perfect, they nonetheless provide some practical ideas for the majority of the UN members to ponder.\nFirst of all, the economic model known as Bio-Circular-Green (BCG) -- coined by the Prayut Chan-o-cha government -- has already gained global recognition since it was adopted at an Apec meeting in Bangkok in 2022. Although the Srettha government has not promoted BCG internationally, it can still be used to promote sustainable development, production and consumption.\nIt must be said that the current Apec chair, Chile, and the former chair, the US, have embraced the BCG model in the Apec measures for sustainable development. Since 2016, Thailand has also served as a coordinator between the UN and Asean for their joint efforts for sustainable development. Concerning the green economy, Thailand has aligned its future cooperation with leading economies such as Japan, China, the UK, and the US to improve green technologies.\nFurthermore, Thailand's experience during the Covid-19 pandemic can be shared as stories of decentralised surveillance systems in public health. Thailand has used village health volunteers in each tambon (district) for three decades, and these volunteers proved to be an indispensable medical resource during the pandemic.\nIn the Thai case, early detection helped to reduce the risk of a wider spread of the disease. The county's 30-baht cure-all health coverage has been hailed by the World Health Organization and the international community. The coverage has also covered millions of migrant workers inside the country. As part of South-South cooperation, Thailand has given funding and know-how to developing countries in Africa and the Pacific Islands in health care.\nThailand has also been active in supporting every UN effort to promote peace and security and full respect for the international rule of law. Notably, issues related to disarmament and empowering women in UN peacekeeping forces have long been advocated. Its voting records at the UN also show Thailand's strong support for the UN Charter and its principles, much to the chagrin of great powers.\nIn addition, Thailand and its Asean colleagues have been ensuring that the region will be a zone of peace and prosperity without the threat of nuclear weapons. Asean-led mechanisms could provide some best practices, especially when it comes to preventive strategies and consensus building. Asean ideals encourage cooperation, not confrontation. Most importantly, it prevents any hegemonic tendency by the great powers.\nAnother important element of the pact will be human rights and social justice. Thailand has a chequered record on these issues. Although Thailand has signed eight of nine international conventions on civil and political rights, the implementation of all these human rights instruments is far from sufficient. Controversies related to Section 112 must be addressed because it involves Thai youth and future generations that will become the country's driving force -- one of the pact's key chapters.\nTo become a leading advocate of the pact, the country's executive and judicial branches must undertake major reforms; otherwise, the country's long-standing efforts and achievements in the rights-based approach will be forgotten. As such, Thailand must leverage the idea of global governance. Otherwise, the country will be forever stuck with the same negative narratives that Thailand is not a democracy and that it disrespects human rights and freedom of expression.\nAll told, Thailand will take an active role along with other colleagues from developing countries to ensure that the pact will be comprehensive and inclusive, which will inspire the UN members and their citizens to implement it.\nKavi Chongkittavorn\nA veteran journalist on regional affairs\nKavi Chongkittavorn is a veteran journalist on regional affairs\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat type of hotel location do you prefer in Thailand?\nBeachfront resorts\nCity-center hotels (close to shopping, restaurants, attractions\nSecluded, nature retreats\nNear airports for convenience\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nGeopolitics\nKavi Chongkittavorn\nDo you like the content of this article?\n2\n21\nCOMMENT\n(12)",

Yet slowly but surely, the distinctive heritage of our local communities is disappearing. Often property developers destroy historic buildings in pursuit of profit. But why do their rights always seem to come first? Why do we have to beg to protect our cultural assets?\nThe underlying problem is neglect of duty by the state sector and politicians. Our leaders and government agencies fail to see the value of Thailand's diverse community heritage, dodging their responsibility to protect it. We need lawmakers and officials to enact strong, new legislation to revamp our heritage conservation system, which is weak and long out of date.\nThe gradual disappearance of Bangkok's heritage-rich Sam Yan district shows the problem. Look at aerial photographs taken 20 years ago, and you will see that this neighbourhood around Chulalongkorn University was packed with schools, religious buildings, shophouses, small restaurants, and movie theatres such as the Lido Cinema and Scala Cinema. For decades, these low-rise, vintage buildings have hosted a rich community life mixing local, national, regional and global people, cooking, art, learning, commerce, sports, spirituality and more.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe temples came alive on festival days. Those movie theatres were stylish places for young people to spend free time. Secondary schools there include top institutions such as Triam Udom Suksa, Satit Chula, and the Satit Patumwan as well as schools for disadvantaged children. Generations of Sam Yan's ethnic Chinese community have fond memories and stories about these places.\nThe Sam Yan area is owned by Chulalongkorn University, which is a government institution funded by our taxes. As landlord, it is the steward not only of property but also of cultural resources and historical legacies. In just the past 10 years, however, this institution has sacrificed much of the community's heritage. Many buildings have disappeared. Chula's property company raised rents, forcing families and legacy businesses to vacate. Religious sites are threatened. Condominiums and shopping malls have replaced rows of commercial shophouses and community schools.\nRELATED\nlife\nNew movies out this week: June 14-20\nlife\nThe last stand  for Chao Mae Thap Thim\nThe university has awarded concessions to big real estate developers. A much reported case is that of the Central Group -- a concessionaire that redeveloped a major site at Siam Square. Within half a year, the Scala Cinema, the largest standalone theatre left in Southeast Asia, was demolished to make way for a multi-storey commercial complex.\nCulture fans and conservationists pleaded for the university to save this architecturally important building and use the structure as a cultural and education space. Scala indeed had been more than a theatre. Famous for its extravagant exterior with a giant hall, grand staircase and chandelier, built in the Art Deco style that emphasises the use of geometric shapes, the cinema -- designed by Chira Silpakanok and built in 1969 -- eventually received the Outstanding Architectural Conservation Award 2012.\nBut the Chula executive supervising property management responded that the Scala Cinema lacked sufficient merit as heritage. The university claimed that it had no responsibility to conserve the half-century old venue because it had not been registered as a heritage site under Thai law. This legalistic stance let our city down.\nOld heritage, new generation\nThe heart of Sam Yan and its ethnic Chinese community is the sacred site popularly known as the \"Mazu Shrine,\" named after one of the two goddesses worshipped there by descendants of Teochew immigrants from south China. Today's shrine dates from a 1959 renovation, but it was first established 150 years ago, before the university was founded. It now stands in the middle of an ugly construction site, soon to be surrounded by modern towers.\nDespite this shrine's cultural and historical significance, the university, as landlord, defied the protests by demanding to take control of the site by 2020 so it could be demolished. Since the shrine's caretakers did not comply, the university sued them for 120 million baht in damages.\nThe struggle to save the Mazu Shrine continues. But even if it fails, the campaign has been worth the effort because it shows how much the public cares about heritage. The protesters have sued, refusing to give up even after four years. Students at Chula and other universities support the cause. A documentary film, The Last Breath of Sam Yan, revealed this story to Thais nationwide and people around the world when released last year in theatres and on Netflix. Social media posts about the Mazu Shrine on X (formerly Twitter) and on other platforms have been shared tens of thousands of times. During the past year, young people have flocked to the shrine to make offerings.\nWhy do millennial and Gen Z Thais love an old shrine? For many of us, it reminds us of our cultural roots. In a globalised city cluttered with look-alike high-rises, the Mazu Shrine stands out. It embodies the spirit of the unique town that we once had -- or that we might have again.\nSam Yan's redevelopment might make some profit, but these gains are outweighed by a huge loss of heritage. Nevertheless, Chulalongkorn and the rest of the government don't seem to care.\nMounting losses nationwide\nDozens of other historic buildings have been destroyed throughout Thailand since 2000. Bangkok's Mahakan Fort Community was evicted, and their 19th century wooden houses demolished in 2018. Thonburi's great temple, Wat Kalayanamit, tore down its century-old monk houses and other extraordinary buildings. These and other sad cases demonstrate the failure of the state and institutional landowners to protect historic buildings valued by the public.\nWe need a new approach. Yongthanit Pimonsathean, a Thammasat University conservation expert, says that unfortunately, our only legal tool to preserve heritage is the 1961 \"Act on Ancient Monuments, Antiques, Objects of Art and National Museums, B.E. 2504,\" which is weak, ambiguous and outmoded.\nThis law mandates preservation of \"monuments,\" but does not clearly define what they are. It puts the Culture Ministry's Fine Arts Department in charge of conservation, giving it discretion to interpret the law. In practice, the department tends to take a narrow approach, usually focusing on major religious, royal and government properties that are very old. Since the department is underfunded and understaffed, this might well be the most pragmatic approach. And to its credit, the department works hard to protect monument sites. But our vague 1961 law leaves many thousands of properties, such as important mid-20th century buildings, at risk of destruction. In the case of the Mazu Shrine, for example, the Fine Arts Department does not view it eligible for legal protection.\nWe need a strong law and system that, like in other countries, outlines specific, objective criteria for the classification and protection of all types of heritage, with guidelines and data accessible to the public. It should devolve some authority to local officials and communities, so that they are empowered to protect local sites. Because our system is so centralized, even the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration lacks the authority to protect heritage buildings and neighbourhoods. Only the Fine Arts Department can.\nDecentralizing conservation would benefit our grass-roots economies. Our national government wants to develop \"secondary\" travel destinations and promote \"quality\" tourism. One good way to do this is to empower provinces, towns and villages to take care of their own architectural assets.\nQuality heritage would appeal to visitors, help nurture small hospitality businesses and let local people keep their sense of identity and belonging.\nMy generation loves heritage. We and future generations have a right to keep it. Our lawmakers and government institutions have a duty to respect this right and to protect our heritage. The way to do it is clear: revise the outdated heritage law.\nNetiwit Chotiphatphaisal&nbsp;is a human rights activist, preservationist and former president of the Student Council of Chulalongkorn University.

It can mean different things to different people, but broadly, it can be seen as a regional framework that supports Asean's role as the dominant regional platform to overcome common challenges and engage with external powers.\nFor citizens of the Asean community, they know its intrinsic value as it has kept the region stable and resilient throughout its more than five decades of existence.\nIn a fast-changing world, questions are frequently asked about whether the Asean centrality concept should be redefined. Indeed, the concept of Asean centrality was one of the major issues that Asean leaders discussed in the bloc's latest meeting in Hanoi last week.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe discussion on Asean centrality is lively and stimulates questions and even cynicism. At a lunch retreat, Vietnamese scholar Nguyen Hung Son, vice president of the Diplomatic Academy of Vietnam, gave a good account of the evolution of Asean centrality. He said back in the 1980s, when the concept of Asean centrality did not exist, the region was depicted as \"flying geese\", meaning that member states, such as Singapore, the Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia, had the potential to develop quickly.\nRELATED\nopinion\nReconfiguring Asean rights declaration\nbusiness\nHow gold fosters economic growth and prosperity\nIn the following decade, Asean was perceived as a \"driver\" for regional cooperation. Questions were raised about whether it was just a driver and whether the passengers (member states) were setting the direction. No matter what the answer was, Asean would go on to assume that it was in the driver's seat, which helped to drive regional processes. Complaints were also made about there being too many hands on the wheel.\nAs Mr Son observed, when Asean entered the 21st century, the bloc turned itself into a \"central hub\"--akin to an airport able to provide navigation and protection services. But when it came to regional issues that required the bloc's reactions or action, Asean was seen as a \"talk shop\" or the \"Nato\" (no action, talk only) of Asia.\nToday, Asean centrality is recognised for its part in driving high economic growth in the region. But what form will Asean centrality take over the next 20 years?\nAsean is currently wrapping up its new Asean Vision 2045, which envisages a bloc that is future-ready, future-proof, nimble, and agile. In the not-too-distant future, it is projected that the Asean region will become the world's third-most populous region and fourth-largest economy, with a fast-growing middle class that will outweigh the ageing population. Moreover, given its diversity and good connectivity, the region will become an innovative society.\nMr Son said he believes that Asean should be bolder in the future. It should become the leading \"goose\" of growth, a pioneer in green transformation, digital connection and innovative economics. Asean also can be an example of turning contestation and confrontation in the South China Sea into cooperation and connectivity.\nIn addition, Asean can serve as an example of how to successfully address multiple crises, such as climate change and water and food security in the Mekong region, thus providing solutions to other regions.\nOn centrality, Mr Son concluded with a proviso that the concept must not make the bloc complacent; Asean, after all, must not shy away from attempting to lead and shape in future.\nIn retrospect, similar observations were made in 1977 when Asean opened up for dialogue, market access, and assistance with foreign partners.\nAt that time, Asean officials were only concerned about locations and setting agendas. They insisted all meetings be held in an Asean capital and all agendas fixed by the rotational chair and its members. Back then, the Asean centrality concept was merely a procedural affair.\nSubsequent economic cooperation and engagement with the dialogue partners increased the bloc's confidence that its agenda should be further discussed and shared with others. From the 1990s onwards, the bloc has increased Asean-led mechanisms that take in dialogue partners on cooperation on matters related to political/security, economic, social/cultural, and development.\nAt the 9th East Asia Summit in Nay Pyi Taw in 2014, its key agendas were initiated by the US, especially on global health issues and epidemic disease (Ebola).\nBecause Asean aims to be the main driving force in the region and prevent any hegemony from outside, active engagement from dialogue partners such as the Asean Regional Forum, the East Asia Summit, and the Asean Defence Ministerial Meeting is a must. Luckily, Asean is not a military grouping; it only promotes peace-making and peace-keeping. It has never weaponised conflicts, near or far.\nToday, Asean centrality has already gained traction as the great powers, particularly the US, China and EU, continue to woo Asean.\nDuring the first special Asean-US summit in California in February 2016, the Obama administration, for the first time, openly supported the Asean centrality and Asean-led mechanism in the evolving regional architecture. Other dialogue partners such as China, Japan, South Korea, India, Australia and New Zealand have long accepted Asean centrality as a pivotal tool for forging closer cooperation and partnership between the bloc and dialogue partners.\nTo make Asean centrality sustainable and relevant, its members' governments and their lawmakers must show goodwill and implement all Asean agreements and policies in a way that only promotes the bloc's centrality.\nMeanwhile, younger generations also need to be exposed to Asean affairs in a more holistic way, not fragmented as it is currently. For instance, the region's school children should be able to sing the Asean Way, the bloc's anthem. Activities and programmes promoting the Asean identity and strengthening the sense of belonging should be encouraged.\nWith its convening and convincing power, Asean centrality 2.0 can go global and create a milestone, especially the efforts to build a better and peaceful world.\nTaking advantage of the current situation, with the ongoing desire of the US-China to improve their strained relationship, Asean could provide a neutral venue for them or, for that matter, any conflicting parties to exchange views and mend their relationship because the bloc does not take sides.\nKavi Chongkittavorn\nA veteran journalist on regional affairs\nKavi Chongkittavorn is a veteran journalist on regional affairs\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat hotel facilities are most important to you when choosing accommodation?\nSwimming pool\nFitness center\nRestaurants and bars\nMassage and spa\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nAsean\nGeopolitics\nDo you like the content of this article?\n3\n18\nCOMMENT\n(2)",

More than 180 delegates, representing 30 countries and over a dozen organisations, attended the event. A new addition to the conference was the 'UBD Youth Forum' that encouraged young professionals to join the dialogue,\" Ms Battsetseg noted.\nMongolia views the UN peacekeeping operations as one of the important means of maintaining international peace and security, she said.\nIn the two decades that Mongolia has participated in UN peacekeeping, over 20,000 Mongolians have served as \"blue helmets\" in 11 peacekeeping missions in hot spots around the world.\n\"Currently, we are the 19th-largest contributor to UN peacekeeping. In the Northeast and Central Asian region, we are the second-largest troop contributor after China,\" Ms Battsetseg said.\nPromoting gender equality and empowering women and girls, especially those living in rural areas, are also high on the Mongolian government's agenda -- moves that have been taken to the international level.\nMongolia has organised a number of events to further these goals, she said, such as an international conference on strengthening the role of women in peacekeeping in June 2022 and the Female Foreign Ministers' Meeting in June 2023.\n\"For this year, Ulaanbaatar will host the World Women's Forum on August 22\u201323. The forum will focus on the importance of women's empowerment, gender equality, and their participation and leadership in addressing climate change-related issues and the attainment of the SDGs,\" she said, referring to the United Nation's 17 Sustainable Development Goals.\n50 years of P2P exchanges\nDespite Thailand and Mongolia formally establishing ties on March 5, 1974, Ms Battsetseg said their first encounter can be traced back to the 13th or 14th century, to a meeting of their envoys.\nFinding common ground in Buddhism, as well as some elements of their respective cultures and traditions, the two sides were able to lay a strong foundation for the development of ties despite their geographical separation, she said.\nSince the start of democratic reforms in Mongolia in 1990, both countries have witnessed progress and success in various areas of cooperation.\nPeople-to-people exchanges climbed, highlighted by Her Royal Highness Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn's visit to Mongolia in 1992 and a visit by the president of Mongolia, His Excellency Mr P O Chirbat, to Thailand in 1994.\n\"Many other high-level visits followed, adding momentum, enriching the scope of cooperation, and fostering friendly relations between our two countries,\" Ms Battsetseg said.\nAt the same time, the number of Mongolians travelling to Thailand is increasing as both sides have waived visas for ordinary passport holders since 2007 and launched seasonal direct flights.\nThailand is also proving a magnet for Mongolian tourists and especially medical tourists, Ms Battsetseg said.\nIn 2023 over 13,000 Mongolians travelled to Thailand, a notable increase from 8,000 the year before. Conversely, the number of Thai nationals visiting Mongolia in 2023 surpassed 2,000, marking a threefold rise from 2022.\nSetting its sights on welcoming more global adventurers, Ulaanbaatar has declared 2023\u20132025 as \"The Years to Visit Mongolia\", under the rallying call of \"Welcome to Mongolia\".\nFor this campaign, the government eased entry visa rules for travellers from 30 countries and launched an online visa application system that allows citizens from 99 countries to apply for visas easily, ensuring a smooth experience.\nThis promotion has amplified Mongolia's appeal as a top-tier destination, Ms Battsetseg said, and as of December 2023 the country has been witnessing a record influx of tourists.\nAlso, due to the country's expanding network of air connections and enhanced road infrastructure, navigating the vast expanses of Mongolia has become more convenient.\n\"We seek to welcome more Thai tourists to our country so they can experience its natural beauty and the hospitality of the Mongolian people,\" Ms Battsetseg said.\nMutual trade and investment\nAside from the people-to-people connections, both sides are hoping to see more mutual trade and investment.\nMs Battsetseg said a body will foster regular dialogue and expand collaboration across various sectors. A five-year work plan has also been mapped out as a framework that guides cooperation in priority areas.\nMoreover, the two countries have established a Joint Trade Commission which is crucial for expanding trade and economic cooperation, she said.\n\"It is important to keep the momentum of our dynamic cooperation [going],\" she added.\nThe country is seeking to explore new areas of cooperation that align with Mongolia's 2050 Vision and Thailand's Vision 2030, she noted.\nAs Thailand strives to become a leading industrial hub, agricultural research and development that enhances both countries' capabilities in food production could be a new area for cooperation, Ms Battsetseg suggested.\nShe pointed out that Mongolia's expertise in livestock farming could complement Thailand's strengths in crop cultivation and processing.\nAlso, joint efforts to promote organic and sustainable farming practices could open up new markets for agricultural products from both countries, especially in regions with a growing demand for organic food.\n\"Furthermore, we could cooperate in air cargo transportation, as our direct flights from Ulaanbaatar to Bangkok are scheduled to operate year-round starting from this year. Last year alone, 53,000 Mongolians travelled to Bangkok, Phuket and Pattaya, and Thailand was one of the top destinations for Mongolians,\" she added.\nOn top of that, with the increasing demand for digital technology and innovation, Mongolia is keen to collaborate with Thailand in promoting digital innovation and entrepreneurship through exchange programmes, joint hackathons, and startup incubation initiatives.\nIn particular, Ms Battsetseg said, collaborating in financial technology (fintech) could involve sharing expertise in blockchain technology and developing financial services tailored to the needs of both countries.\nFacilitating more interactions between Mongolian and Thai businesses is essential, she said.\nFostering closer ties between the two sides' respective business communities will cause mutual trade and investment to grow, Ms Battsetseg said.\nThis could involve organising more business forums, exchanging business delegations, attending Mongolia's Economic Forum and the region's largest food and beverage trade show, THAIFEX, or other trade shows and exhibitions, and engaging matchmaking events to connect potential partners and facilitate collaboration, she said.\nAt the same time, \"MonGolia, Always Moving\" was launched as this year's tourism campaign.\nMs Battsetseg said that from an economic standpoint it showcases Mongolia's investment prospects while aiming to preserve the country's traditional nomadic culture.\nAt the same time, it serves as an open invitation to ramp up tourism and attract increased investment.\n\"We also look forward to finalising drafts of the pending intergovernmental agreements and treaties that will improve the legal environment. Looking ahead, I am confident that the future of Mongolia-Thailand relations is even brighter.\" Ms Battsetseg said.\nRegional partners\nAmid a series of ongoing global challenges, Ms Battsetseg said Mongolia recognises the importance of solidarity, interconnectedness, cooperation and multilateralism.\nMongolia and Thailand are committed to not only strengthening bilateral cooperation but also to working together at multilateral forums to address issues of shared concern, she added.\nSince the 1990s, Mongolia has pursued a multi-pillar and open foreign policy, actively seeking to integrate into the Asia-Pacific region.\nRecognising the importance of Asean's role in regional integration, Ulaanbaatar acceded to the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation in Southeast Asia in 2005.\nMs Battsetseg said it intends to actively participate in the activities of Asean and its subsidiary bodies moving forward.\nThailand is Mongolia's third-largest trade partner in Southeast Asia.\n\"As we commemorate the historic milestone, I would like to share a quote from the speech of King Rama IX,\" Ms Battsetseg said.\n\"'Friendship between nations is important, but what is more important is people-to-people relations, which can guarantee peace and progress'.\"\n\"I firmly believe in the significance of this statement, as it underscores the paramount importance of fostering connections between individuals as the cornerstone for achieving lasting peace and progress,\" Ms Battsetseg continued.\n\"I am confident that our relationship will continue to flourish, and I look forward to working closely with my Thai counterparts to further strengthen our partnership for the mutual benefit of our countries and people.\"\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat type of condominium are you most interested in?\nStudio\n1-bedroom\n2-bedroom\n3-bedroom\nPenthouse\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nMongolia\nThailand\nTies\nRelations\nDo you like the content of this article?\n18\n3\nCOMMENT\n(1)",

She observed heightened interest from both public and private sectors in several regional countries, recognising it as a key instrument for steering towards a low-carbon future.&nbsp; &nbsp;\nRELATED\nlife\nReimagining education, co-creating lifelong learning for youth and adults\nbusiness\nDeep tech startups spawned\nCarbon pricing serves as a crucial climate tool, incentivising countries to decrease emissions and transition to cleaner technologies. Momentum is building for the adoption of carbon pricing instruments such as carbon taxes, emission trading systems (ETS), and international carbon markets under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement.\nMs Kemp said that Asian carbon markets, particularly in China and India have witnessed rapid growth, with ASEAN countries also making strides towards implementing carbon market mechanisms and infrastructure, such as carbon exchanges. Building up the infrastructure and ecosystem for carbon pricing markets is vital for achieving the goal of net-zero carbon emissions.\nCollaboration among stakeholders, including public and private sectors, as well as academic institutions, will be instrumental in advancing the development of carbon pricing markets. According to Ms Kemp, Singapore and Indonesia are among the first ASEAN countries to have adopted a carbon tax as part of comprehensive decarbonisation pathways.\nShe added that policymakers and regulators play a crucial role in leveraging regulated market infrastructure to ensure integrity and efficiency in carbon markets.\nPolicymakers should further enhance the role of carbon exchanges, marketplaces, and innovation platforms in bolstering market development.\nAdditionally, fostering financial innovation and the creation of financial products and services to enhance liquidity and investment in carbon markets, can unlock greater opportunities. Regional collaboration also plays a pivotal role in promoting carbon markets and advancing efforts to reduce carbon emissions, she said.\n\u201cPublic-private partnerships represent another crucial element in bolstering market development through international and regional collaboration to harmonise regulations and standards across the region,\u201d she said.\nThrough a collaborative initiative involving the World Bank, International Emissions Trading Association, and the Singaporean Government, these partnerships have established the Climate Action Data Trust (CAD), an innovative carbon credit platform to bolster market integrity and streamline registry integration by consolidating all carbon credit projects and data into a unified platform.\nIn a separate panel discussion, Dr. Hao Liang, Associate Professor of Finance and Co-Director at SGFC, discussed the topic of financing transition, noting that businesses are increasingly shifting towards transition finance to help carbon-intensive businesses reduce their carbon emissions.\nSimultaneously, companies and investors have been driven to raise new funds by leveraging green financial instruments and making investments in sustainable assets.\nAccording to Dr. Liang, the market requires over $6 trillion annually for achieving sustainable development goals, and hundreds of billion dollars are needed to help achieve the net-zero carbon goal, while total global assets under management for sustainable investment are projected to reach around $50 trillion by 2025.\nHao Liang said clarity and credibility in regulatory standards will help build up the confidence of the private sector in transforming to transition finance. At the same time, clear regulations would also streamline the reporting procedures for companies to provide information to regulators.\n&nbsp;\u201cThe regulator should let companies know clearly what projects are green or not green, and what\u2019s type of information that companies need to disclose or not,\u201d he said.\nNonetheless, he noted clarity of regulations and standards would help mitigate the risk of greenwashing (the act of making false or misleading statements about the environmental benefits of a product or practice), while at the same time instilling greater trust in directing capital towards legitimate green and transition activities.\nIn December 2023, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) launched the Singapore-Asia Taxonomy for Sustainable Finance (\u201cSingapore-Asia Taxonomy\u201d), the world\u2019s first to pioneer the concept of a \u201ctransition\u201d category, to address Asia's specific needs and facilitate cross-border capital flows into green and transition activities.\nSingapore leads ASEAN in green, social, sustainability, and sustainability-linked bonds and loans, with over S$30 billion worth of such bonds and loans originating from Singapore in 2022. The country also boasts a vibrant carbon service and trading ecosystem, with over 100 firms, the highest concentration in Southeast Asia.\nMoreover, Singapore serves as a key centre for climate risk financing instruments, with catastrophe bond issuances totalling S$2.5 billion over 2021 and 2022, double the total from 2018 to 2020.\nWinston Chow, Professor of Urban Climate, Pillar Lead (Urban Infrastructure), said at the forum on the topic of \u201cClimate Risk: Protecting Ecosystems and Biodiversity\u201d, that biodiversity plays a crucial role in mitigating climate change. Ecosystems and biodiversity are natural carbon sinks, providing so-called nature-based solutions to climate change.\nHe said international collaboration is essential to address climate change and biodiversity loss and achieve sustainable development goals. Government sectors can tackle these challenges through international agreements such as the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, the UN Convention on Biological Diversity, the Paris Agreement, and the Kunming-Montreal Biodiversity Targets.\nIn addition to sharing insights at the forum, SMU develops strategies for policymakers and financial institutions to support Asia's transition to lower carbon emissions.\nThe Singapore Green Finance Centre (SGFC), co-created with the industry to ensure applicability and relevance, encompasses three key themes: transforming businesses by integrating climate-related data and ESG considerations into decision-making, designing policies and new initiatives to enhance the efficiency of green finance markets, and catalysing the development of green finance solutions.\nIn 2023, SMU established the SMU Overseas Centre Bangkok. The Centre aims to strengthen ties with the Thai community through facilitating knowledge exchange, forging partnerships, fostering research collaborations, and supporting professional development.

Through the sessions, the world saw a more vivid image of China, with its steady progress, trailblazing innovation, openness, confidence and solidarity. Now, it expects more opportunities, which are brought about by China's high-quality development.\nChina's economic development is a significant impetus for the global economy. In 2023, China's economy enjoyed an overall upward momentum, with its gross domestic product (GDP) surpassing 126 trillion yuan (603.3 trillion baht), an increase of 5.2% from the year before. The country remains the world's largest driver of development, contributing to over 30% of the world's economic growth.\nAlthough it is facing a range of both domestic and external challenges, China continues to enjoy several distinct advantages -- it has a structured, socialist market economy, a super-sized market that guarantees demand, a fully-fledged industrial supply chain, a high-calibre, labour force and an abundance of entrepreneurs.\nADVERTISEMENT\nAs such, the ongoing trend of economic recovery and long-term growth will not change. In 2024, China's economy will maintain the momentum of development and continue to provide new opportunities that will contribute to the recovery and further development of the global economy.\nRELATED\nbusiness\nThe 3 Cs: Elements of trust every leader needs\nbusiness\nReaching for the sky\nRecent years have seen China's strategic emerging industries rapidly grow. In 2023, exports of the \"new trio\" of modern tech products, namely electric vehicles, lithium-ion batteries and photovoltaic products, achieved a 30% increase. The digital economy witnessed a rapid development, with the 5G penetration rate topping 50%. Achievements in cutting-edge fields of scientific and technological innovation, such as artificial intelligence and quantum technology kept emerging. A new, high-quality productive forces have taken shape, which is strongly boosting further high-quality development.\nThe strategy of opening up for mutual benefit provides valuable opportunities for countries around the world. Despite the rise of de-globalisation internationally, China stays committed to further opening up and firmly upholds globalisation and multilateralism.\nChina has established 22 high-standard pilot free trade zones and further eased requirements for foreign investments. It is aiming to achieve solid progress in high-quality Belt and Road cooperation in an effort to deepen multilateral and bilateral economic cooperation. These include negotiations on building a \"Version 3.0\" of the China-Asean Free Trade Area. All these measures prove that China is continuing to open up.\nComprehensive, democratic consultations inform China's solution to the problems of humanity. During the two sessions, more than 5,000 deputies to the NPC and members of the National Committee of the CPPCC gathered in Beijing to discuss state affairs. In the past year, as a response to the suggestions brought up in the previous two sessions, over 2,000 policies and measures were issued by the State Council, and a number of urgent problems relating to economic and social development have been resolved. It shows how China's system is the broadest, most genuine and most effective democratic model for the Chinese people.\nDemocracy is a common value of humanity and a part of civilisation. Countries can communicate and learn from each other on the basis of mutual respect, but there is no fixed, one-size-fits-all model for democracy. Imposing one's own democratic model on others is akin to trampling on the principles espoused by democracy.\nBuilding a community with a shared future will contribute to world peace and stability. As a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and Minister of Foreign Affairs, Wang Yi, pointed out on the margins of the two sessions, CPC is dedicated not only to pursuing happiness for the Chinese people and rejuvenation for the Chinese nation, but also to promoting human progress and world harmony.\nIn this changing and turbulent international environment, China is committed to an independent foreign policy of peace and will remain a staunch defender of peace, stability and progress. China will focus on building a human community with a shared future, and integrate the development of China with that of the world. Faced with the major issues of the world, China will pool broader international consensus and promote the joint efforts of countries to tackle challenges and achieve common prosperity.\nIn November 2022, President Xi Jinping visited Thailand and the two countries announced the start of a new era of Sino-Thailand relationship with a shared future.\nIn October last year, Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin attended the 3rd Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation in China. Under the strategic guidance of the leaders of the two countries, mutual trust between China and Thailand has continued to grow, practical cooperation has been upgraded, and public support for \"China and Thailand as one family\" has further strengthened.\nThis year will see the 75th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China and the 72nd birthday of His Majesty King Maha Vajiralongkorn. Next year will mark the 50th anniversary of the diplomatic relationship between China and Thailand, when bilateral ties will be standing at a historically new starting point.\nTogether with Thailand, China is committed to implementing the consensus reached by the leaders of the two countries, enhancing the Sino-Thai comprehensive strategic cooperative partnership, and accelerate the building of a China-Thailand community with a shared future to enhance stability, prosperity and sustainability.\nChina will stick to the principle of building a human community with a shared future and share development opportunities with Thailand and other countries in world to jointly build a better future for all!\nHan Zhiqiang is Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the People's Republic of China to the Kingdom of Thailand.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nHow much do hotel reviews (e.g., TripAdvisor, Google Reviews) influence your accommodation choice?\nVery important, I always check reviews before booking\nSomewhat important, I check reviews if I\u2019m unsure\nNeutral, I don\u2019t pay much attention to reviews\nNot important at all, I don\u2019t check reviews\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nDo you like the content of this article?\n0\n8\nCOMMENT\n(2)",

The six riparian countries -- China and other five downstream nations (namely Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Vietnam and Thailand) which are \"enjoying the same river\" -- form a community with a shared future featuring \"equality, sincerity, mutual assistance and kinship\". The Lancang-Mekong Cooperation (LMC) mechanism, named after the river, has been warmly received and responded to by all relevant countries since its initiation.\nThis year marks the 8th anniversary of the establishment of the Lancang-Mekong Cooperation mechanism. Guided by the principles of \"development first, equal consultation, pragmatism and efficiency, and openness and inclusiveness\", the six countries have promoted the LMC since its inception, with the mechanism increasingly becoming an important platform for fostering regional economic integration, maintaining regional peace and stability, and bolstering the well-being of all people in the region.\nThe six countries are dedicated to creating a powerful engine for development. The LMC architecture has been constantly improved, with deepening cooperation in agriculture, production capacity, connectivity, green energy, innovation and other fields. More than 700 Lancang-Mekong Cooperation Special Fund projects have been launched one after another, creating a strong impetus for the economic development of countries in the region.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe six countries are committed to accelerating the construction of a strong shield for common security. Practical cooperation in the field of non-traditional security and law enforcement has been further strengthened, with thorough progress made in ensuring the safety of the Lancang-Mekong region, in combating cross-border online gambling and scams, drug trafficking and other criminal activities, and guaranteeing social stability in the Mekong sub-region for the safety and security of people's lives and property.\nRELATED\nopinion\nNew chapter for Mekong region\nopinion\nMekong River region on more minds\nThe six countries have further improved their relationship through mutual understanding and friendship fostered by the mechanism. People-benefiting projects such as the \"Plan on Lancang-Mekong Water Resources\", the \"LMC Bumper Harvest Projects\", and the \"Green Lancang-Mekong Initiative\" have been successfully implemented. The International Video Week, Media Summit, Think Tank Forum, and the \"Lancang-Mekong Adventure\" press group and other events have produced fruitful results month after month. Tourism cooperation and people-to-people exchanges are making progress every day, and the friendship between the peoples of the six countries being enhanced year after year.\nThailand is a main initiator and important participant of the LMC and, as a co-chair this year, is playing an increasingly prominent role as a partner within the mechanism. In November 2022, President Xi Jinping visited Thailand, and the two countries announced a new era of relationship as a joint community with a shared future. In October last year, Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin visited China and attended the Third Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation. Under the strategic guidance of the leaders of our two countries, the mutual trust between China and Thailand has been deepened, practical cooperation upgraded and as a result, the public support for the concept of \"China and Thailand as one, close family\" has never been more solid.\nThis year marks the 75th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China and the 72nd birthday of King Maha Vajiralongkorn Phra Vajiraklaochaoyuhua of the Kingdom of Thailand. The next year will see the 50th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Thailand, which is when the Chinese-Thai relationship will reach a new milestone.\nChina will firmly implement the principle of \"Amity, Sincerity, Mutual Benefit and Inclusiveness\" in the neighbourhood, as put forward by President Xi Jinping. China will ramp up work with Thailand and other countries along the Lancang-Mekong River to share development opportunities, accelerate the building of an even closer community with a shared future, support each other and work together on the path to modernisation, and jointly forge a brighter future for the Lancang-Mekong River Basin!\nHan Zhiqiang is Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the People's Republic of China to the Kingdom of Thailand.

The relics were brought to Thailand from India courtesy of the Indian government.\u2009(Photo: Pattarapong Chatpattarasill)\nThe historic loan of relics of the Lord Buddha and his chief disciples Sariputra and Moggallana to Thailand has created excitement among Buddhist Thais.\nIt was an act of gracious generosity by the Indian government because the relics are classified in the \"AA\" (rare) category of antiquities and art treasures. Under this classification, the relics are not meant to be lent for exhibition within and outside India.\nThe relics were brought from India to Thailand to commemorate the auspicious occasion of His Majesty the King's 6th-cycle birthday, or 72nd birthday, which falls on July 28, and to mark Makha Bucha Day, which fell on Feb 24.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe relics were lent upon the \"special request\" of the Thai government and were first displayed in Bangkok from Feb 24 till last Sunday, then in Chiang Mai from Tuesday till Friday, Ubon Ratchathani from this coming Sunday till next Wednesday, and Krabi during March 15-18 before being returned to India.\nRELATED\nlife\nImmortality reimagined\nopinion\nPoor pay, rich save\nMore than a million Buddhists reportedly flocked to Sanam Luang in Bangkok to pay their respects to the relics, according to the Ministry of Culture.\nWhilst, this Buddhist diplomacy has enhanced Thai-India relations, the question arises whether it can elevate India's position in the lower Mekong Basin.\nBack in 2000, India established the Mekong-Ganga Cooperation (MGC) as part of its Act East policy in the 21st century after the signing of the Vientiane Declaration in order to strengthen its relations with mainland Asean countries along the lower Mekong Basin, including Cambodia, Myanmar, Laos, Thailand and Vietnam.\nThe Act East Policy was upgraded from India's Look East Policy, introduced in the early 1990s when the country's interests began to experience increasing challenges due to the rise of China.\nAccording to the Open Development Mekong, between 2016 and 2017, China was the largest financial contributor towards developmental programmes in the Lower Mekong countries amongst other existing donors, including Japan, South Korea, Australia and the United States.\nIt has been observed that China continues to increase its engagement through its Belt and Road Initiative programme, which India can not easily match in the near future.\nNevertheless, India remains important for Asean, especially after becoming an Asean Dialogue Partner in December 1995.\nFor 2022-2023, India's Ministry of Commerce and Industry highlighted that India's trade with Asean accounted for 11.3% of India's global trade. In 2023, India became the world's most populous country and is projected to be the third-largest economy by 2030.\nIndeed, India and other countries in the Lower Mekong Basin do not only share economic interests but they also have shared cultures and values, especially ones that are influenced by Buddhism and Hinduism.\nThe common understanding of religious identity between India and the Mekong countries, taking root for centuries, allows the relationship between India and these countries to persist and prosper.\nWhilst Theravada Buddhism has dominated Cambodia, Myanmar, Laos and Thailand, these countries also embrace Hinduism, which is the largest religion in India. Many local cultures in the northeastern region of Thailand, Laos, and Cambodia are significantly influenced by Hinduism. Indeed, Buddhism is the second largest in Southeast Asia after Islam, and recognised as the most important religion in the Mekong region.\nThe compatibility and harmony between Buddhism, Hinduism and national culture and values within Lower Mekong countries induce compatibility with India. Each year, hundreds of thousands of Thai Buddhists travel for pilgrimage to India.\nHindu gods, Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva, as well as Ganesha, are worshipped in Thailand and across many parts of Asia.\nThis spiritual connection has promoted common cultural beliefs and values between people in Lower Mekong countries and India. Thus, it facilitates the implementation of India's people-to-people diplomacy in the region.\nAt the general debate of the 78th UNGA in September 2023, Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, India's minister for External Affairs, announced the evolution of India's foreign policy from the era of non-alignment to that of Vishwa Mitra (a friend to the world).\nThus, the strengthening India-Mekong countries relations, through their shared religious identity is apparently India's effective soft-power tool that can serve its new foreign policy strategy.\nNevertheless, a question remains: what kind of friendship is to be materialised within the implementation of India's vision of being a friend to the world? How will India re-energise its MGC, a cooperation framework that will have its 25th anniversary next year? Will India's friendship goals align with those of China or the West?\nCurrently, the principle of non-interference is acknowledged as a crucial element of China's foreign policy, while the United States, the European Union (EU)&nbsp;and many other Western countries have indicated clearly that democracy and human rights is an important element of their foreign policies.\nThus, financial support from China is typically referred to as \"no strings attached aid\", whereas aid from the West is conditional.\nIn his address to the US Congress in June 2023, Narendra Modi, prime minister of India, emphasised that democracy is one of the \"sacred and shared values\" between India and the US. He highlighted that \"Now, the US is the oldest and India the largest democracy. Our partnership augurs well for the future of democracy. Together, we shall give a better future to the world and a better world to the future.\"\nHowever, there are challenges for India to materialise this pledge within the Lower Mekong countries.\nCurrently, the human rights situation in Myanmar -- where India and Thailand both have borders -- is worsening and being strongly criticised by the international community since the 2021 Myanmar coup d'\u00e9tat. Meanwhile, civil society groups are experiencing limited space in Laos and Cambodia, while freedom of expression is being suppressed in Thailand.\nThe threat against core democratic values and institutions within the region is a big challenge for India's engagements. As the world's largest democracy with a very diverse society, how can India's democratisation be a model for democratic development within lower Mekong countries?\nWithin the competing geopolitical landscape of the Lower Mekong Basin, China's intention for engagement is questioned and scrutinised by both the international community and local NGOs, whether such support from China is ultimately intended to serve only the interests of Beijing.\nWhile the US since the implementation of the US pivot to Asia after President Barack Obama announced the \"rebalance\" to the Asia-Pacific in his East Asia Strategy between 2009\u20132017, the US re-engagement is not entirely trusted by the locals because of its demonised global reputation and the political scars of the Vietnam War.\nThe tainted reputation of both China and the US may provide a space for India to assert its role and re-energise its relations with countries in the lower Mekong basin.\nNevertheless, India cannot entirely rely on the Buddhist and Hindu spiritual connections in order to \"give a better future to the world, and a better world to the future\", as Mr Modi highlighted. Therefore, to be a friend to the Lower Mekong countries means being a friend to the local people, not just governments.\nIf India can engage in promoting a more democratic environment in the Lower Mekong countries that can create \"the culture that gives wings to thought and expression\", as Mr Modi emphasised, then the common interests between India and these countries can be enhanced.\nTitipol Phakdeewanich is a political scientist at the Faculty of Political Science at Ubon Ratchathani University.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nHow important are environmental sustainability practices (e.g., eco-friendly rooms, waste reduction) when choosing accommodation in Thailand?

(Photos: Varuth Hirunyatheb)\nUnder an increasingly polarised world underlined by the strategic competition between global superpowers -- along with their friends and alliances, it is not surprising that Thailand views the global security landscape with trepidation. Such a trend is a litmus test for middle and smaller power nations to navigate their security policies and engagements. They do not have many choices; nevertheless, these small and medium-sized countries can either align themselves with the most prominent powers or lesser ones that can protect their national interests, or they can get together and use their combined strength to deter the hegemonic ambition of outside powers. Staying alone and pursuing one's pathway without supporting partners is not an option.\nThese perspectives are described in the special report titled Structure of Global Power in 2043, prepared by the Center of Future Studies, Thai National Intelligence Agency (NIA), which analysed the structure of the multipolar world over the next two decades. It must be said that the report is a rare revelation from the country's top intelligence agency. But given the recent developments in the global strategic landscape, including the post-Covid-19 world, the Russia-Ukraine war, and the Israel-Hamas conflict, the Thai public's interest in foreign affairs has been boosted dramatically due to their impacts on the country's economic, security and social conditions.\nIn the report, the NIA envisages three scenarios that Thailand will encounter. The first is a familiar one-world with two systems -- one led by the US and the other by China. Their rivalries will continue to reign as before. The US-led liberal-democratic world will link with like-minded countries in the form of mini-lateral or ad hoc groupings to mitigate China's growing influence. As trusted US partners, the European Union, UK, Australia, Japan, and South Korea will further strengthen their alliance through multilateral groupings.\nADVERTISEMENT\nOn the other hand, China continues to be a rising power. It will envelop alliances with opposite political and economic systems, such as Russia, Iran, and North Korea, which have contentious relations with the US. Their relations would be expedient as well due to their commonly perceived adversary.\nThe next scenario would be a fragmented world comprising issues-based groupings bounded by shared interests -- these countries do not have to be ideologically aligned. As such, they can cooperate and compete at the same time. Their relationship would be flexible and defined by each of national interests. The key of the issue-based group is non-alignment with any prominent power. Great powers such as the US, China, and Russia could not impose or direct ideas or diplomatic directions on this emerging new world order group.\nRELATED\nthailand\nThailand, US to resume direct flights\nbusiness\nKEX eyes net operating cash break-even in 12 months\nThe final one has been described as \"the condominium of power\", where major key state and non-state players jostle for power and influence with other players, which now include big corporations and hi-tech companies. Under these circumstances, no single group will have overwhelming power over other groups. Therefore, the balance of power and brinkmanship would be the norm for international players. Meanwhile, international organisations, while not playing leading roles or as strong as before, remain pivotal, serving as platforms for consultation on common global issues with more participation from non-state players.\nBeyond these scenarios, the NIA has also made one important observation: the Thai public must have a better awareness and knowledge of foreign powers' influence impacting their domestic economic, security, and social conditions. Each region of Thailand has different strategic assets.\nIn the country's northern region, the superpowers' rivalries could play out domestically, especially in terms of security and economic imperatives due to its strategic location. The report stressed one caveat as the weakest link -- possible future engagement and influence with external powers at the district and provincial levels. When it comes to the Northeast region, the US-China strategic competition has manifested itself through the Mekong River-related activities and programmes. Washington is keen to focus on the role of security and civic engagement, while Beijing is zeroing in on economic-oriented issues and cooperation.\nFor the Central Plains, the superpowers' conflict has taken a toll on the Thai populace via the political divide -- democracy vis-\u00e0-vis non-democracy.\nAll other temporary trends involving geopolitics also play out in the capital of the Land of Smiles. Moving to the South, the delineation is clearer -- there are two sections: the South in general and the so-called deep South of Yala, Pattani and Narathiwat -- three restive southern border areas. In southern Thailand, the whole area has a combined potential for tourism and mega-infrastructure project investment and development. On the side of the Andaman Sea, there is a need to improve and upgrade the overall standard of fishing fleets.\nIn the deep South, NIA's report projects the emerging role of non-government organisations supported by Western countries that have granted support to community-based groups in these three provinces. But foreign support in the deep South has not come from the West.\nMiddle Eastern countries -- which share religious beliefs with predominantly Islamic-Thai villagers in Yala, Pattani and Narathiwat will even pay more attention and support to nourish and cement the already strong and deep bondage with Ismanic-Thai communities in these three provinces.\nThe valid question is -- What should Thailand do? The answer is quite simple -- Thailand must adopt a pro-active strategic equilibrium without choosing the side of any dominant power. However, the Thai approach must be rules-based with the preservation of national interest in mind. Thailand must also clearly manifest its position on key global issues if necessary.\nFurthermore, it is imperative to strengthen internal resilience as well as increase the Thai people's awareness and knowledge of foreign countries' ever-present influence over the multiple aspects that contribute to social cohesion and their general welfare.\nThailand can build on its middle power's status and assume a leading role in Southeast Asia through effective Asean-led mechanisms. In addition, to further reduce the country's security risk, Thailand must diversify its external relations more than before. In a similar vein, lessening dependency on either superpower would increase Thailand's ability to face future uncertainty and fragmented world more effectively.\nKavi Chongkittavorn\nA veteran journalist on regional affairs\nKavi Chongkittavorn is a veteran journalist on regional affairs\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nHow much do hotel reviews (e.g., TripAdvisor, Google Reviews) influence your accommodation choice?\nVery important, I always check reviews before booking\nSomewhat important, I check reviews if I\u2019m unsure\nNeutral, I don\u2019t pay much attention to reviews\nNot important at all, I don\u2019t check reviews\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nTHAILAND\nSECURITY\nDo you like the content of this article?\n9\n27\nCOMMENT\n(8)",

This is often referred to as \"fixing a cursed year\". In Thai, \"cursed year\" is Pi Chong, while avoiding bad luck is Kae Chong.\nWat Mangkon Kamalawat, also known as Wat Leng Noei Yi, in the Yaowarat area of Pomprap Sattruphai district, is commonly known as Bangkok's Chinatown.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe holy site ranks as one of the most visited temples in the country, and it is a place where Thais of Chinese descent visit during the Lunar New Year to make merit and perform special rites to exorcise any portents of bad luck.\nRELATED\nopinion\nApril Fools' Day Jokes That Should Be Real\nthailand\nPraying for better times ahead\nThe temple's Cantonese name -- Leng Noei Yi, which means \"dragon lotus temple\", is expected to draw even larger crowds during this year's celebration.\n\"Every year, I come here at least once during the Chinese New Year festival,\" said visitor Kanyarat Heman.\n\"Since we don't really know what will happen to us or our loved ones, making merit and thinking about good things [at the start of the New Year] will at least make us feel more calm,\" she said.\nMaking merit makes her contemplate the mistakes she made in the past year and makes her promise she will not repeat them this year, she said.\nMs Kanyarat said she visits the temple every year because she believes that it is a sacred place -- a notion shared by others who come to make merit and wishes.\n\"This temple is best known as a holy place most suitable for performing the rite to ward off bad luck we're doomed to encounter at some point,\" said Somchai Charusomphon, a 63-year-old visitor.\n\"I come twice a year because I feel good whenever I'm here. It's just for the rite to exorcise my bad fortune,\" he said.\nHe said he has developed a strong bond with the temple as his father was a Chinese migrant who settled here years ago.\nBuilt during the reign of King Rama V, the Chinese Mahayana Buddhist temple sits at the heart of Yaowarat.\n\"Thais and Chinese are more like neighbours, so our temples share certain similarities,\" said Mr Somchai.\nThis year, he brought a friend, Suraphong Sabaichit, who was visiting the temple for the first time.\nMr Suraphong said his first impression was that the temple had beautiful Chinese architecture, which he described as being akin to an interesting art exhibition.\n\"It's much easier to get here now thanks to the access provided by the MRT underground electric train system,\" he said.\n\"And as we no longer have to worry about where to park our car, we have more time to explore Yaowarat and enjoy some of the delicious street food.\"\nTalking talismans\nApart from visiting temples, some Thai-Chinese buy talismans and other New Year gifts to ward off bad luck.\nOne man, who gave his name as Tony, 60, told the Bangkok Post he had recently purchased some dragon-shaped lanterns.\n\"I believe this Year of the Golden Dragon will bring me a big fortune, and I expect good things are in store for me this Lunar New Year,\" he said.\nHe was referring to one of the five elements -- earth, wood, metal (gold), fire and water -- that go alongside the 12 animal signs in the Chinese zodiac.\nSirikarn Ratanopap, 22, said she had snapped up an \"auspicious\" bracelet with a dragon pendant to bring her good luck.\n\"This Chinese New Year, I'm paying my respects to my ancestors who passed away while also enjoying some rest with my family,\" Ms Sirikarn said.\nSiripha Jamrunkit, 22, who also bought a dragon-themed accessory for good fortune, said she believed this would be her lucky year.\nAt the temple, she wished for health and happiness for her family for the year ahead, Ms Siripha said.\nChinese ambassador's greetings\nHan Zhiqiang, the Chinese ambassador to Thailand, sends his best wishes on the auspicious occasion of Chinese New Year.\n\"On the occasion of bidding farewell to the old year and welcoming this new year, I would like to send my sincere blessings and wishes to people in all career fields in Thailand.\"\nIn the past year, China has made strong progress in high-quality development and has achieved outstanding success in modern development as Gross Domestic Product expanded by 5.2% -- contributing more than 30% to global economic growth and remaining the most important mechanism driving the world economy.\nHan Zhiqiang, the Chinese ambassador to Thailand\nIn past years, Chinese diplomacy has played an important role and led the world towards promoting the building of a community with a shared future for humanity. Also in the past years, friendly cooperation between China and Thailand has developed in all areas. A shared future between China and Thailand has become the consensus of the people following President Xi Jinping's historic visit to Thailand in 2022 and after HRH Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn paid her 50th visit to China last year.\nPrime Minister Srettha Thavisin officially visited China just after taking office and worked with China's leaders to draft a new blueprint for developing relations between the two countries. The trade value between the two countries remains at an all-time high. Thai agricultural exports to China continue to grow. The export value of fresh durian alone is worth US$4.6 billion.\nChinese companies' investments in Thailand have developed strongly, contributing to the recovery of the economy after the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. The exchange of people between the two countries has reached nearly 4 million people. At the beginning of 2024, the two countries signed a visa exemption agreement, leading to the \"Visa Free Era\".\n\"We are full of confidence in the bright future of relations between our countries. China and Thailand are not far apart. We are like brothers and sisters. I wish good luck to the Chinese and Thai people. Be happy and healthy,\" he said.\n10 unmissable places for Chinese tourists celebrating Lunar New Year\n1. Chinatown at Yaowarat Road, Bangkok\nWith a history going as far back as a century ago, Yaowarat Road is a perfect area to experience many aspects of local examples of Chinese culture and customs all in one place, including great food and the arts. Full of character and charm, the area has been the home of generations of Chinese Thais.\nIn collaboration with the Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT), the Cultural Division of the Chinese embassy in Thailand, and the Chinese Cultural Centre, the annual Chinese New Year event will be held at Yaowarat Road over the weekend. Among the many activities will be Fujian traditional arts, lion dance performances, and Chinese lamp decoration activities.\n2. Wat Phra Kaeo and the Grand Palace, Bangkok\nThe two royal locations that share the same wall are a perfect antidote to the busyness of the city. Chinese visitors should consider visiting both places in Bangkok as they are rich in Thai traditional art, be it religious architecture or a wall painting based on the&nbsp;Ramayana&nbsp;from Indian literature, which is a huge part of the lives and beliefs of Southeast Asian countries.\nAwareness of what proper apparel should be worn at both places and about the foreigner-rate entrance fee should be considered by those interested in visiting.\n3. A cruise trip along the Chao Phraya River\nChinese visitors can enjoy a cruise trip along the broad river that slowly weaves through the city's heart. Most routes start from the Rama III Bridge and go on to the Rama VII Bridge. If on a night cruise, passengers will see the light displays along Wat Phra Kaeo and the Grand Palace riverfronts. Many cruise agencies offer great deals for tourists, including buffets and musical performances.\n4. Khao San Road, Bangkok\nNot far from Sanam Luang, visitors can take a tour of the \"International Road\" after finishing a cruise trip on the river. Khao San Road is famous among international visitors for its backpacker accommodation and vibrant nightlife where tourists can meet and mingle.\n5. Chatuchak Weekend Market, Bangkok\nFor shopaholics, this market, known locally as JJ Market, is famous for having everything that can be sold in one place, with the most popular being souvenirs, antiques, local goods, and clothing.\nAs the market covers 88.5 rai of area, divided into 27 zones, we suggest visitors decide before the trip whether to shop or just chill out. Price comparisons are also suggested for the shopping experience here, as is price bargaining, in which visitors can expect to see the item price drop by up to 60%.\n6. Train Night Market, Ratchada, Bangkok\nThe Train Night Market is a great location to buy local products and try some of the Thai street foods that the city is famous for. Easy to reach by the MRT, bus or taxi, the market is divided into zones for visitors to enjoy their shopping experience.\n7. Bangkok's department stores\nThe city is well known for its department stores (all with great air-conditioning!), such as Siam Paragon, CentralWorld, Iconsiam, and Asiatique the Riverfront. They also offer great eating options, including food courts with street food fare.\n8. Damnoen Saduak Floating Market, Ratchaburi\nIf you are interested in a one-day trip outside the city, then this floating market, located west of Bangkok, is an immersive experience with vendors on their boats. Among it all, visitors can enjoy food, including fruits, from the vendors in this riverside community.\n9. Maeklong Railway Market, Samut Songkhram\nThis famous market is also known as&nbsp;Talad Rom&nbsp;Hoop&nbsp;(Flicked Umbrellas Market) because all vendors close their umbrellas when trains pass through. Despite some public concerns over the market's location, it also displays Thai people's independent nature.\n10. The Ancient City, Samut Prakan\nThis spacious recreational park is a great way to experience recreated examples of the country's most famous historic architecture all in one location. Options for getting around the park include using a golf cart, bicycles, a motorised tram or your car. We also suggest visiting the nearby Erawan Museum to complete your trip.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nHow important are environmental sustainability practices (e.g., eco-friendly rooms, waste reduction) when choosing accommodation in Thailand?

The culmination of last year's events saw Vietnam strategically host US President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping within a short interval, symbolising the delicate balance in the Southeast Asian nation's foreign relations.\nADVERTISEMENT\nPositioned between two major powers vying for influence, Vietnam's nuanced approach underscores its adept navigation of geopolitical complexities.\nAs global dynamics evolve, Vietnam's role as a diplomatic fulcrum exemplifies the artistry of its \"bamboo\" strategy, enabling harmonious engagement with competing superpowers. While this \"bamboo diplomacy\" has proven highly effective so far, the lingering uncertainty revolves around the extent to which this strategy will continue to produce favourable outcomes in the days ahead.\nRELATED\nopinion\nVietnam's bamboo diplomacy at play\nbusiness\nTCEB eyes 23m Mice visitors\nAt the recent 32nd National Diplomatic Conference in Hanoi, General Secretary Nguyen Phu Trong highlighted the intrinsic connection between Vietnam's diplomatic tradition and the symbolism of Vietnamese bamboo. Describing this tradition as having \"firm roots\" and \"flexible branches\", Mr Trong emphasised the adaptive and flexible nature of Vietnamese diplomacy.\nRooted in the core principles of being \"firm in objectives, flexible in strategies and tactics\", Vietnam's diplomatic strategy mirrors the resilience and versatility of bamboo. Such a flexible yet firm statecraft underscores Vietnam's ability to navigate a complex geopolitical landscape with steadfast objectives while employing adaptable strategies and tactics.\nThe concept of \"bamboo diplomacy\" was coined by General Secretary Nguyen Phu Trong in 2016 and has become a defining strategy for Vietnam's statecraft since.\nMr Trong, in his second term leading Vietnam's Communist Party, introduced this diplomatic approach to address the challenges of an evolving geopolitical landscape. Since 2021, Vietnam has actively implemented this policy, showcasing a nuanced balancing act.\nA glaring example is its stance on the South China Sea, where Vietnam has been in direct conflict with China. While expressing shared concerns with the US regarding Beijing's assertiveness in the South China Sea, Vietnam maintains substantial economic ties with China. Notably, last year, Vietnam's diplomatic finesse was evident in its unprecedented double upgrade of relations with the US in September, followed by a commitment to forge a \"shared future\" with China in December. This strategic manoeuvring reflects Vietnam's adept use of bamboo diplomacy to secure its interests amidst complex global dynamics.\nIn an era marked by intense great power competition and an uncertain global future, Vietnam stands out as a notable success story in skillfully navigating the delicate balance between rival powers. The intricate dance between major players on the world stage demands extreme diplomatic finesse, and Vietnam has adeptly achieved this delicate equilibrium.\nVietnam strategically embraced the concept of a \"community of shared future\" with China, a move calculated to avoid upsetting Beijing. This diplomatic manoeuvre not only preserved crucial relations with China but, at the same time, Vietnam cautiously navigated the delicate dance of upgrading relations with the US and Japan, well aware of potential repercussions from a watchful China.\nThe US had persistently advocated for this elevation, pressuring Vietnam to choose a strategic timing to avoid provoking Beijing. The timing was crucial to avert Chinese displeasure. During Mr Xi's visit, Hanoi and Beijing inked 36 cooperation agreements spanning infrastructure, trade, and security, underscoring the complex diplomatic landscape where nuanced decisions are vital to maintaining a delicate equilibrium. Vietnam has been skillfully manoeuvring its balancing act, leveraging trade as a pivotal component of its strategy. Despite a historical rivalry, the US now stands as Vietnam's primary export destination, while China remains a crucial partner for imports. With this newfound diplomatic equilibrium, Vietnam, strategically positioned in global supply chains, anticipates a substantial influx of foreign capital.\nIn an era marked by a widening divide between the West and the China-Russia alliance, Vietnam's reliance on \"bamboo diplomacy\" also faces challenges. The emerging Cold War 2 dynamics make bamboo diplomacy harder to implement and appear insufficient to navigate the complexities of this evolving geopolitical landscape.\nAs the conflict in Ukraine reshapes global strategies, Vietnam's bid to maintain neutrality amid superpower rivalries is becoming more complex. The prospect of political shifts in the US, from a Biden administration to a potential return of Donald Trump, adds an element of uncertainty for Vietnam. Congressional displeasure or specific issues could strain Vietnam-US relations, prompting Hanoi to carefully navigate potential obstacles. Against the backdrop of the South China Sea dispute, Vietnam aims to avoid taking sides, maintaining a delicate balance.\nApparently, this stance has a short shelf-life, and it will lose its relevance soon. The existing fabric of global politics is marked by complexity and unpredictability, pointing towards the inevitability of strategic competition among major nations.\nThe imperative for Vietnam lies in adapting to these intricate geopolitical dynamics while safeguarding its national interests. In light of heightened competition between the US and China, Vietnam faces a formidable task, prompting the need for a fresh and adaptable safety net in this era of geopolitical flux.\nIn this multipolar landscape, developing countries face heightened risks, compelling Vietnam and its Southeast Asian counterparts to tread cautiously amid evolving global and regional dynamics.\nImran Khalid is a freelance contributor on international affairs based in Karachi, Pakistan.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat is your budget range for renting a condominium?\nUnder 10,000 THB/month\n10,000 - 20,000 THB/month\n20,000 - 40,000 THB/month\n40,000 - 60,000 THB/month\nOver 60,000 THB/month\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nBamboo diplomacy\nDo you like the content of this article?\n14\n2\nCOMMENT\n(4)",

Others agreed. \"It is all great,\" said another.\nOverall, Mr Xi's two-day visit last week yielded more results beyond trade and investment as both countries have further cemented and boosted their ties to a level never seen before.\nADVERTISEMENT\nDespite their disagreements and disputes, China and Vietnam, for the past 15 years, have managed their friendship quite well, nurturing their unique, comprehensive, strategic cooperative partnership in ways that no other countries could imitate.\nRELATED\nbusiness\nHong Kong airport boosts efforts to lure foreign airlines as it waits on Cathay\nthailand\n30 years of global learning\nThe countries have now attained a trust level to top up relations with a common resolution that they are ready to build a China-Vietnam community of a \"shared future\" that carries strategic significance.\nIn fact, in the Chinese language, Ming yun cong tong ti, has a deeper meaning as it encompasses all future multifaceted developments and engagement as if they are sharing the same destiny.\nReading the 5,978-word joint China-Vietnam statement carefully, one can see the most important paragraph containing 59-words appeared on the front page describing their special mutual relationship.\nThe two sides stress that they are \"good neighbours, good friends, good comrades, and good partners, and both are socialist countries under the leadership of a communist party, with similar political regimes, compatible ideology and beliefs, similar development paths, a shared vision, shared future, and common efforts for happy people and a wealthy and strong country and for the noble cause of peace and progress of mankind\".\nIndeed, such a comprehensive prognosis of bilateral ties is rare these days.\nMr Xi's visit was successful because it came at a time of great fluidity in the geopolitical landscape as countries, big or small, are trying to navigate relations in more balanced ways.\nChina and Vietnam have special relations with the US. It is imperative that these two neighbouring countries understand each other's thinking and understanding of the US ties, as it impacts their bilateral relations. Three months ago, US President Joe Biden was in Hanoi and upgraded their relations to comprehensive strategic cooperative partnership too.\nObviously, at this juncture, both superpowers are courting Vietnam. However, judging from the substantive outcomes of the two-day trip, China and Vietnam wanted their future relations stable and predictable. Truth be told, both socialist neighbours are equally anxious about what will become of their ties with Western countries and democracies in the years to come. They want to avoid any negative spill-over effects. Mr Xi's trip here bore testimony of such a pathway.\nTo understand the dynamics of Chinese-Vietnamese ties within the Asian context, three important points must be discerned:\nFirst, both nations are the two most successful communist countries operating in the capitalist-dominated world. The way they practice and implement their common ideologies has distinguished the two neighbours from the rest of the world. Indeed, their economic progress in the past four decades has dazzled democratic and capitalistic allies and friends. Their pragmatism has brought prosperity and stability to their people. Indeed, their combined economic and strategic clouts have already left strong impressions in the regional and global community.\nSecondly, apart from a shared Marxist ideology, the two countries also share common borders, history, tradition, culture, and language, with their bond and friendship dating back thousands of years. One has to live in Vietnam to realise that Chinese-Vietnamese relations have deeper roots and are intertwined beyond what the conventional knowledge holds.\nThirdly, more than officials would like to admit, their \"shared future\" will be stronger and more sustainable if they can further support each other and strengthen their cooperation in all areas. In other words, with the new resolutions enshrined in the joint statement they have the toolkit needed to deepen ties and avoid harming each other. Under current circumstances, with their socialist systems imbued with Chinese and Vietnamese characteristics, either side can afford a backsliding of fraternal ties.\nBeijing and Hanoi last week signed 36 agreements that will bolster cooperation in fields including crime prevention, multilateral trade, transportation and digital economy, cyber security, and telecoms, among others. The two sides called for cooperation between Vietnam's \"Two Corridors, One Belt\" framework for connectivity with China's Belt and Road infrastructure development programme. Furthermore, the two leaders also signed a memorandum of understanding on enhancing cooperation in the digital economy and digital data.\nAs far as the region is concerned, Vietnam's support of China's three global initiatives -- Global Security Initiative (GSI), Global Developmental Initiative, and Global Civilization Initiative -- is very significant as it will have a positive impact on Asean.\nOverall, Asean supports the development and civil proposals. However, several Asean members have yet to endorse the GSI as some of them have agreed to do further studies.\nDuring the discussion over maritime and territorial disputes, both countries stressed the need to better manage and actively address differences at sea. It was also important to note that the two countries would actively seek basic and long-term solutions acceptable to both sides under the framework of the China-Vietnam agreement on basic principles guiding the settlement of sea-related issues and international law, including the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.\nFurthermore, the two countries agreed to implement the Declaration of the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea, which Vietnam calls the East Sea. Besides the maritime disputes, both sides also discussed how to combat phone scammers as well as further cooperation in cyber security.\nIn his signed article in the Nhan Dan Daily, Mr Xi described China-Vietnam ties, reiterating that regardless of the changes in the global environment, their countries have worked together to protect peace and tranquillity, pursue development and cooperation, and promote prosperity and progress. All things considered, from now on, their ties will be more forward-looking and strategic.\nKavi Chongkittavorn\nA veteran journalist on regional affairs\nKavi Chongkittavorn is a veteran journalist on regional affairs\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat type of building do you prefer for a condominium?\nHigh-rise (more than 10 floors)\nMid-rise (5-10 floors)\nLow-rise (less than 5 floors)\nNo preference\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nGeopolitics\nDo you like the content of this article?\n4\n13\nCOMMENT\n(8)",

On this momentous occasion, we extend heartfelt greetings to the Turkish community in Thailand and the Thai Nation.\nPUBLISHED : 29 Oct 2023 at 08:00\n&nbsp; Small\n&nbsp; Medium\n&nbsp; Large\n1\nH.E. Mr. Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, President of the Republic of T\u00fcrkiye\nThe Republic of T\u00fcrkiye was founded on October 29, 1923, under the visionary leadership of our esteemed founder and the first President, Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk, hailed as the Father of the Turks. Following the triumphant conclusion of the War of Independence, Atat\u00fcrk embarked on a transformative journey, modernising the nation through revolutionary reforms. Over the past century, T\u00fcrkiye has undergone a profound metamorphosis, emerging as a modern, dynamic, and influential global player. This century has witnessed the establishment of a robust democracy, the evolution of a diverse and dynamic economy, and the promotion of education and culture.\nT\u00fcrkiye's Visionary Century\nAs we embark on T\u00fcrkiye's \"Century of T\u00fcrkiye,\" a visionary concept introduced by President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, our nation aspires to propel itself forward with renewed vigour and enthusiasm, building on the achievements of the past century. In a world marked by rapid geopolitical shifts and mounting global challenges, we are committed to fostering peace and security, strengthening international relations, promoting prosperity, and advancing our global objectives\u2014cornerstones of Turkish foreign policy in this new century.\nPursuing these goals and guided by our enduring objective, \"Peace at home, peace in the world,\" as articulated by the founder of our Republic, Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk, T\u00fcrkiye pursues an enterprising and humanitarian foreign policy. Drawing strength from our geographical location, rich historical heritage, robust institutions, skilled human resources, and dynamic economy, our comprehensive foreign policy encompasses political, economic, cultural, and multilateral dimensions.\nRELATED\nthailand\nTHAI to fly to Istanbul from Dec 1\nlife\nGuru Weekly's Buzz: Sept 8-14\nH.E. Ms. Serap Ersoy, Ambassador of the Republic of T\u00fcrkiye to Thailand\nGlobal Cooperation in a Complex World\nWithin this framework, T\u00fcrkiye has cultivated an extensive global network of cooperation, including High-Level Cooperation Councils with 30 countries, four Intergovernmental Summits, and numerous trilateral and multilateral regional initiatives. Our close ties extend to regions including the Balkans, the Middle East, North Africa, Southern Caucasus, South and Central Asia, and beyond. T\u00fcrkiye's \"Asia Anew\" initiative, launched in 2019, underscores our commitment to developing comprehensive relations with Asia and the Pacific, home to rising powers in the 21st century. We have expanded our presence in ASEAN countries, fostering strategic relations and seeking to harmonise China's Belt and Road Initiative with our Middle Corridor Initiative.\nWe also remain committed to strengthening our strategic relations with Europe, with EU membership as a strategic priority. T\u00fcrkiye maintains a vital partnership with the United States as a NATO ally, contributing significantly to security and prosperity in Europe. Our role as an energy hub and transit country further underscores our importance in European and global energy security.\nAdditionally, T\u00fcrkiye supports regional ownership and solutions for regional challenges, participating actively in various regional organisations and initiatives. In today's complex world, addressing global challenges necessitates collective efforts through cooperation and effective multilateralism, a philosophy that guides T\u00fcrkiye's active diplomacy within multilateral forums. We advocate for diplomacy over confrontation, dialogue over discord, and engagement over isolation, exemplified by our mediating role in several international conflicts. T\u00fcrkiye's active involvement in organisations such as G-20, the UN Security Council, and our advocacy for UN reform demonstrates our commitment to global peace, stability, and security.\nMustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk, founder and the first President of the Republic of T\u00fcrkiye\nT\u00fcrkiye's Compassion and Aid to the World\nAs we celebrate our centenary, T\u00fcrkiye remains dedicated to shaping a brighter and more prosperous future, fostering global cooperation, and advocating for the betterment of humanity through diplomacy, dialogue, and collaboration within the international community.\nIn addition to our enterprising foreign policy, the human element remains central to our endeavours. T\u00fcrkiye has embraced its role as a compassionate global power, exemplified by our response during the coronavirus pandemic, where we extended assistance to 160 countries and 12 international organisations. This underscores the humanitarian dimension of our foreign policy. Our commitment to humanity extends to our developmental and humanitarian aid programs, where T\u00fcrkiye stands as the world's largest humanitarian donor, with the highest per capita humanitarian spending. T\u00fcrkiye also holds the distinction of being the world's top host country for refugees, providing sanctuary to over 3.4 million Syrians under temporary protection. Our humanitarian efforts reach far beyond our borders, encompassing regions like Somalia, Yemen, and the Rohingya Refugee crisis. Through agencies like the Turkish Cooperation and Coordination Agency (TIKA) and the Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency (AFAD), we offer not only material aid but also healthcare and education, reflecting our commitment to global welfare.\nCultural Bridges and Shared Heritage\nT\u00fcrkiye's rich cultural heritage serves as a bridge between civilizations, fostering dialogue, understanding, and cooperation among nations. Our enterprising foreign policy extends beyond political spheres, touching the hearts and minds of individuals, nurturing a shared sense of humanity and mutual respect among diverse populations.\nAs we embark on the \"Century of T\u00fcrkiye,\" our determination grows stronger. We will continue to be a beacon of stability, working towards a world that is prosperous, peaceful, and just. This journey entails forging partnerships, promoting dialogue, and, above all, safeguarding the principles of humanity.\nThailand and T\u00fcrkiye: 65 Years of Friendship\n2023 also marks another significant occasion: the 65th anniversary of diplomatic relations between the Republic of T\u00fcrkiye and the Kingdom of Thailand. As we commemorate this milestone, it is an opportune moment to reflect on the journey that our nations have undertaken since 1958.\nThe bond between T\u00fcrkiye and Thailand is characterised by mutual respect, growing economic collaborations, cultural exchanges, shared values, and a common vision for regional peace and stability. This anniversary offers both countries the chance not only to celebrate their shared history but also to chart paths for future collaboration across various sectors.\nFormalising diplomatic relations in 1958 laid the foundation for a fruitful relationship that has spanned over six decades. However, interactions date back to the 19th century when Prince Damrong visited Istanbul on his way to continental Europe, establishing warm relations with Ottoman Sultan Abdulhamid II.\nSince the establishment of diplomatic relations, both nations have cooperated closely across numerous fronts, embracing diverse cultures, traditions, and values. T\u00fcrkiye and Thailand maintain friendly relations founded on partnership and mutual benefit. High-level visits have been pivotal in deepening bilateral ties, with leaders from both countries exchanging visits to bolster cooperation and explore new avenues.\nTo enhance economic cooperation, former Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs H.E. Mr. Don Pramudwinai visited T\u00fcrkiye in January this year, marking the 4th Joint Economic Commission meeting. The discussions encompassed a wide range of areas, reflecting the broad scope of T\u00fcrkiye-Thailand relations. The \"2nd Turkish-Thai Joint Action Plan 2023-2028\" was signed, encompassing various fields of cooperation and aiming to strengthen the partnership.\nT\u00fcrkiye and Thailand, both significant players in their respective regions, have consistently worked to enhance their economic and trade relations over the years. Bilateral trade reached 2.2 billion Dollars in 2022, an all-time high, covering products ranging from agricultural goods to technological and industrial products. Extensive business delegations and trade fairs have played a pivotal role in forging these connections. Favourable investment climates in both countries have facilitated mutual investments, with leading T\u00fcrkiye-based companies such as BEKO, H\u0130DROMEK, KORDSA, Hayat Kimya, Tu\u011fba Dairy, and Farplas investing in Thailand. Conversely, prominent Thai companies, CP and Indorama, have invested in T\u00fcrkiye. We encourage more Thai companies to explore investment opportunities in T\u00fcrkiye, benefiting from its dynamic economy, robust\ninfrastructure, and strategic location as a gateway to Europe, North Africa, the Mediterranean economic zone, and the Middle East. Moreover, Turkish Airlines has increased its daily direct flights between Istanbul and Bangkok to six, and a memorandum of understanding between Turkish Airlines and Thai Airways was signed in August this year, aiming to enhance cooperation through a joint venture operation.\nDigital Opportunities and Emerging Sectors\nWith the digital age reshaping global economies, emerging sectors like technology, renewable energy, green economy, and connectivity present new avenues for collaboration between our nations. The defence industry is also emerging as a promising area for future cooperation. As both countries continue to prioritise economic diplomacy, the prospects for even more significant collaboration in trade, investment, and other sectors are promising. The time is ripe for seizing these opportunities.\nCultural exchanges between T\u00fcrkiye and Thailand have played a pivotal role in fostering mutual understanding and respect for each other's heritage and traditions. Events organised by the Embassy this year, such as culinary festivals, movie screening days, and photo exhibitions commemorating the 65th anniversary of diplomatic relations, have not only promoted friendship but also strengthened people-to-people bonds.\nEducation and People-to-People Connections\nEducation serves as a vital bridge between our nations, with an increasing number of Thai students pursuing their education in T\u00fcrkiye through various scholarship programs. These connections among our young people hold the promise of a brighter future with enhanced collaboration and understanding. We will continue to encourage Thai students to explore educational opportunities in T\u00fcrkiye. In line with our growing relations in the field of education and cultural exchanges, I am pleased to announce that the Maarif Foundation has been working on establishing a school in Thailand. The Maarif Foundation has the exclusive authority to establish schools abroad on behalf of the Turkish government. Additionally, the Yunus Emre Cultural Institute, named after a prominent Turkish folk poet and mystic, plans to open an office at one of Bangkok's esteemed universities, offering Turkish language courses. These educational and cultural exchanges are vital for nurturing people-to-people connections, which form the foundation for enduring international relations.\nMultilateral Collaboration on Global Challenges\nT\u00fcrkiye and Thailand have cooperated in various multilateral platforms, aligning with shared goals in sustainable development, climate change mitigation, and the fight against global inequality, especially within the United Nations. Our collaboration on the international stage reinforces the concept of effective multilateralism and sets an example for cooperative international relations.\nRegional ownership and partnerships are among the most important aspects of enhanced cooperation and dialogue among nations, ensuring security, stability, and increased economic collaboration within their respective regions and beyond. Thailand has played a significant role in ASEAN since its inception, remaining a vital player in regional diplomacy, economic integration, cultural exchange, and security cooperation. With Thailand's support, T\u00fcrkiye has become a Sectoral Dialogue Partner with ASEAN. Recently, the Turkish Grand National Assembly obtained observer status at the ASEAN Inter-Parliamentary Assembly (AIPA). We look forward to expanding our cooperation with ASEAN into new horizons with continued support from friends like Thailand.\nhttps://www.hidromek.com.tr/products\nBuilding Prosperity Through Trade and Investment\nThe 65th anniversary of diplomatic relations between T\u00fcrkiye and Thailand is more than a commemoration of the past; it is a celebration of a future filled with possibilities. The solid foundation built over these six decades serves as a springboard for deeper engagement, not only between our governments but also between our people. In a world grappling with various geopolitical challenges, our bonds of friendship and close cooperation will continue to grow stronger with each passing year. Speaking of friendship and deep ties between our countries, I would like to take this opportunity to express our sincere gratitude once again to their Majesties, the Thai government, the private sector, and the entire Thai nation for their generosity, support, and solidarity with T\u00fcrkiye following the devastating earthquakes that occurred on February 6th in the southern part of our country. The Turkish nation will always cherish this act of friendship in the years to come.\nT\u00fcrkiye will continue to stand out as a reliable and responsible regional and global actor as it embarks on the journey into the \"Century of T\u00fcrkiye.\" Our enterprising and humanitarian foreign policy will persist in securing our national interests while simultaneously contributing to the shared goals of humanity. With these thoughts and sentiments, I commemorate with great joy and pride the 100th anniversary of T\u00fcrkiye's foundation. I also celebrate the 65th anniversary of Turkish-Thai friendship, which I am confident will grow even stronger with time. Long live Turkish-Thai Friendship, Long live the Republic of T\u00fcrkiye.

China welcomes this policy, and expects that Thailand can provide better and safer services for Chinese tourists.\nWe hope we can seize this opportunity to bring tourism cooperation to a new level.\nChina is willing to work with the government to implement the outcomes of Chinese President Xi Jinping's historic visit to Thailand in 2022.\nWe stand ready to deepen comprehensive strategic cooperation, and maintain political mutual trust. We are willing to develop economic and trade relations especially in the digital economy, green economy and scientific and technological innovation, and make new progress through the \"Belt and Road\" Initiative (BRI).\nWe are ready to deepen exchanges in culture and education, enhance friendship and mutual understanding between our peoples, especially young people. We are willing to jointly safeguard regional peace, stability and development, and build the China-Thailand community with a shared future.\nWhat are your expectations regarding the development of ties and mutually beneficial cooperation between China and Asean?\nAsean is a regional integration organisation composed of China's friendly neighbours. China has always prioritised Asean in its neighbourhood diplomacy, and China is committed to developing China-Asean friendly cooperative relations in the spirit of amity, sincerity, mutual benefit and inclusiveness.\nIn 2013, President Xi Jinping proposed building a closer China-Asean community with a shared future. Building on that in 2021, he proposed building a peaceful, safe and secure, prosperous, beautiful and amicable home that we can share together.\nChina and Asean elevated their ties to a comprehensive strategic partnership in the same year. This is not only a natural result of the all-round, high-level friendly cooperation between China and Asean, but also a blueprint for the future development of China-Asean relations.\nChina and Asean have long respected and helped each other, and have been each other's largest trading partners for three consecutive years. We can proudly say the China-Asean relationship has become the most successful and dynamic model in the Asia-Pacific region.\nBullet trains in China can run as fast as 350 km/h. These high-speed trains are seen at China Railway in Beijing.\u2009Anucha Charoenpo\nLooking into the future, China is willing to further build a consensus on cooperation, and strengthen strategic synergy with Asean in order to deliver a higher level of economic integration and interconnected development.\nWe can work together to create a more prosperous growth centre. We are willing to promote mutually beneficial cooperation between the BRI and the Asean Outlook on the Indo-Pacific.\nWe are ready to strengthen connectivity and deepen cooperation in industrial and supply chains with Asean, and will strive to conclude negotiations on the China-Asean Free Trade Area 3.0 as early as possible, which will add new momentum and create new advantages for regional development. Together with Asean, China is committed to safeguarding peace, stability and development in the region.\nWe unswervingly support Asean unity and community building, and firmly support Asean centrality in the regional cooperation architecture. China is willing to join hands with Asean to seize the trend, steer clear of disruptions, share opportunities and create prosperity. Together we can make new steps towards building a closer China-Asean community with a shared future.\nProvide an update on progress concerning the BRI. How much progress has been made so far?\nTen years after its inception, the BRI has become the most popular international public good and one of the largest international cooperation platforms. China has signed more than 200 documents on jointly building the BRI with over 150 countries and more than 30 international organisations.\nOver 90 bilateral cooperation mechanisms have been set up, and more than 3,000 projects are being implemented, mobilising nearly US$1 trillion in investment, and helping lift almost 40 million people out of poverty. The BRI is bringing tangible benefits to the development of participating countries and the improvement of people's livelihoods.\nThailand is located at a crucial point of the BRI and is an important participant and beneficiary. The China-Thailand Railway is a flagship project of the BRI. It will significantly improve the condition of Thailand's railway infrastructure once completed. It will also be connected to the China-Laos Railway, and will bring regional connectivity to a new era.\nThe third \"Belt and Road\" Forum for International Cooperation will be held in Beijing this October. We sincerely invite all partners to this event. Looking ahead, China will work with other countries and international organisations, take \"hard connectivity\" in infrastructure as an important direction, \"soft connectivity\" in rules and standards as an important support, and \"heart connectivity\" with the people of partner countries as an important foundation, to make the BRI high-standard, sustainable and people-centred.\nIs China concerned that efforts and strategies employed by certain Western countries to contain China in the Indo-Pacific region, which have raised global concerns and heightened vigilance, will affect China's strategic partnership policies in the region?\nIt is only natural that the Chinese people strive for a better life and national development through our own hard work. China adheres to peaceful development and pursues a policy of win-win cooperation. China's development is a positive energy for world peace, stability and prosperity. However, out of selfish purposes, a few countries cannot bear China's development.\nIn order to contain China, they even stir up trouble and create conflicts in our region, which jeopardise peace and stability. They use their advantages in the international economic system to launch trade wars and technological blockades, which disrupt global industrial and supply chains, and harm the world economy.\nThe \"Indo-Pacific Strategy\" of the United States is actually a policy tool to contain China. What they have done will certainly arouse serious concern and vigilance among countries in the region and even around the world.\nThere is an ancient Chinese saying that goes: \"A just cause enjoys abundant support while an unjust cause finds little support\". One cannot go against the historical trend. China firmly believes that we have the ability to independently realise Chinese modernisation and the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.\nAny attempt to deprive the Chinese people of their right to pursue a better life or curb China's development will not succeed. In the end, they will only end up shooting themselves in the foot. This is evidenced in the major scientific and technological progress China has made in recent years. China firmly believes the zero-sum mentality and the winner-takes-all hegemony run counter to the trend of history, to the progress of human society, to people's aspiration for peace and development in this region and the world.\nNo matter how it is packaged, no matter how they seduce or coerce, it will only be seen through and cast aside by the countries and people in the region.\nPresident Xi Jinping said in Bangkok last year that countries in our region should uphold international fairness and justice, stay committed to openness and inclusiveness, strive for green and low-carbon development, and bear in mind our shared future, to build an Asia-Pacific of peace and stability, common prosperity, to make it a region that is clean and beautiful, where all are ready to help each other.\nChina is willing to work with countries in Asia and the Pacific to focus on mutually beneficial cooperation, overcome disruptions and sabotage, so as to build an Asia-Pacific community with a shared future and take Asia-Pacific cooperation to a new height.\nHow do you look at the current situation regarding China's economy and can Thailand benefit from China's economic growth?\nSince the beginning of this year, with the sluggish recovery of the world economy as well as the complex and grim external environment, China's economy has also faced some unfavourable factors, but overall it has continued to recover steadily and maintained a long-term positive trend.\nIn the first half of the year, China's GDP grew by 5.5% year-on-year, ranking among the top of world major economies. China's economy has strong resilience, great potential, and huge vitality. It has bright prospects. We are full of confidence in this.\nNow China has entered a new stage of high-quality development. The focus has been shifted from speed to quality. At this stage, the growth rate may stay at 5% to 6% for some time. But if you look at China's total economic volume which accounts for $18 trillion, the annual increase would still amount to $1 trillion.\nAt the same time, China has an institutional advantage from a socialist market economy, a demand advantage from a super-scale market, a supply advantage from a complete industrial system, and a talent advantage from a large number of high-quality workers and entrepreneurs. These are all strong guarantees for China's high-quality economic growth.\nChina is an important engine of world economic growth.\nOver the past 10 years China's contribution to world annual growth has averaged at more than 30%. The International Monetary Fund projects the same level of contribution this year. China will adhere to a high level of opening up.\nWe have the confidence and competence to achieve sustained and healthy economic development. We also have the willingness and ability to share development dividends with other countries around the world, especially neighbouring countries such as Thailand.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat factor most influences your decision to choose a hotel or resort?\nPrice and discounts\nHotel reviews and ratings\nProximity to attractions\nHotel loyalty programs (e.g., points, rewards)\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nSino-Thai\nThai-Chinese\nRelation\nDo you like the content of this article?\n3\n32\nCOMMENT\n(5)",

The Middle Kingdom once again stands tall, restored to its prior glory, and having moved from their prior humiliation to a position of strength, China is vengeful and eager to act as such. Their assertiveness has positioned them within a place of global prominence, albeit doing so through largely unchecked aggression.\nAlthough the aggression has yet to lead to active measures being taken, the steps for this have seemingly been taken, through a military build-up and technological development, particularly with an expanded military presence in the Indo-Pacific region as well as in outer space. It stands to reason that China's military presence in the Atlantic Ocean is not a question of if, but when.\nADVERTISEMENT\nMore specifically, China has increased its military presence in the Himalayas in response to the territorial dispute with India, while in the South China Sea, and to a lesser extent in the East China Sea, militaristic actions through air and sea have been constantly taken to intimidate and coerce sovereign states with internationally recognised claims to the waters and the resources within.\nRELATED\nbusiness\nChina warns against \u2018worship\u2019 of faster growth\nthailand\nHM King, Queen to visit China\nAlthough there has been no official dispute between China and Asean nations with regards to management and utilisation of the Mekong River, China has been acting in a dominant manner without transparency.\nA common theme in the aforementioned examples is China's unilateral posturing. They have completely ignored the rulings of the Permanent Court of Arbitration, which held that China's historical claims over maritime areas inside their purported \"nine-dash line\" of the South China Sea are void of historical facts and evidence and have no basis in established international law. Yet despite this blatant flaunting of international doctrine, China remains a permanent member of the UN Security Council.\nOn the other hand, China has successfully propagated itself as a viable trade and socioeconomic development partner of the Global South. Its development arm, the Belt and Road Initiative has been well-recognised for both positive and negative reasons worldwide. Unfortunately, many projects and programmes that the initiative has funded have failed to live up to their desired impact or sustainability. Recipients of Chinese financial assistance have fallen into a debt trap situation, leading to them becoming what is essentially a client state instead of being a partner. Such is a reflection of emerging Chinese imperialism or neo-colonialism. In response, China's leadership must review and take stock of such an approach. Many countries in the Global South have endured periods of Western dominance and exploitation, and although they might welcome China's gesture of friendship and partnership, they do not wish to fall under the thumb of the re-emerging Middle Kingdom.\nComing back to the issue of politics and security, China's newest friends and partners mainly include the likes of Russia, North Korea and, to a lesser extent, Iran, Cuba and Venezuela. But looking out from the window of Beijing, Shanghai or Shenzhen, the Chinese leadership will surely see the strengthening of the Quad arrangement, sets of tripartite cooperation such as US-Japan-South Korea; US-Japan-the Philippines, Augus; US-Japan-India, US-Australia-India etc and the enhanced sets of bilateral relations such as India-Vietnam; India-the Philippines; Vietnam-the Philippines; and Japan-the Philippines. All of these cooperative activities have their beginnings or root causes from the assertive and aggressive stances taken by China. China has projected itself outward, and the reaction from the regent has come home back to China. It is essentially a boomerang.\nChina would do well to lessen this increased tension and confrontation by promoting diplomacy and dialogue. The Middle Kingdom should look to act in a refined and collected manner of a traditional nation-state of the past and pay homage to the Middle Kingdom not out of fear or military threat but through the respect and admiration that was once earned. The Middle Kingdom was the centre of civilisation. Acting in the interests of the greater good through civility represents the most beneficial aspect of humankind.\nKasit Piromya\nAPHR Board Member\nKasit Piromya is a Board Member of Asean Parliamentarians for Human Rights (APHR), and is a former Thai foreign minister.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat is your budget range for purchasing a condominium?\nUnder 2 million THB\n2 million - 4 million THB\n4 million - 7 million THB\n7 million - 10 million THB\nOver 10 million THB\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nPresident Xi Jinping\nMiddle Kingdom\nKasit Piromya\nChina\nPower\nGeopolitics\nDo you like the content of this article?\n53\n20\nCOMMENT\n(20)",

The US is investigating Thai exports.\nUS producers of crystalline silicon photovoltaic (CSPV) cells and modules submitted petitions on April 24, 2024 to the US Department of Commerce (DOC) and US International Trade Commission (USITC), requesting an anti-dumping (AD) and countervailing duty (CVD) investigation on solar cells and modules imported from four countries in Southeast Asia: Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam.\nThe group alleged the CSPV dumping practices of these countries undercut domestic manufacturing efforts, materially injuring the US solar manufacturing industry.\nOn May 14, in response to the petition, the DOC initiated AD and CVD investigations of solar cells, assembled and unassembled into modules, from these four countries.\nADVERTISEMENT\nOn Oct 4, the US announced preliminary affirmative determinations for the CVD probe, noting that solar cells and modules from Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam are \"being sold, or are likely to be sold\", at less than fair value in the US.\nIn addition, a preliminary affirmative determination was issued for \"whether a countervailable subsidy is being provided with respect to\" those solar cells and modules.\nRELATED\nworld\nChinese President Xi Jinping arrives in Paris with EU trade, Ukraine among hot button issues on table\nworld\nConcerns rise over China's 1 trillion yuan EV, solar, battery exports\nA final determination is scheduled to be released in February or March next year.\nQ: What are CVDs and why is Thailand subject to them for solar cell products?\nCountervailing duties (CVDs), also known as anti-subsidy duties, are trade import duties imposed under the World Trade Organization.\nThey are applied following an investigation that determines a foreign country's subsidies on exports have harmed domestic producers in the importing country.\nThese duties aim to offset or \"countervail\" the subsidies granted by the exporting country for the production or trade of the product.\nAccording to international trade agreements, a subsidy is defined as: a financial contribution, income or price support from the government that confers a benefit tailored to a specific company, industry or region.\nThe petitioner alleged the Thai government subsidised exports of CSPV cells to the US through projects such as the Board of Investment tax incentive projects and China's Belt and Road Initiative.\nQ: How will the US imposition of CVDs on Thai solar cell products affect exports?\nThe US released the preliminary CVD results on Oct 4, with the proposed tariff rates for manufacturers from the four Southeast Asian countries shown on the table.\nThe CVDs for Thai solar cell products were determined to range from 0.14-34.5%.\nThe first figure (0.14%) represents manufacturers that cooperate with the investigation.\nThe figure is below 1%, deemed a \"very low level\" and considered without a subsidy (de minimis), meaning a CVD duty will not be charged.\nThe second figure (34.5%) represents manufacturers that did not cooperate with the investigation, resulting in punitive duties imposed by the DOC.\nThe US plans to impose retroactive duties for up to 90 days at the preliminarily determined rate of subsidy.\nA tariff exemption was previously granted by US presidential order, allowing US renewable energy businesses to continue importing products from existing trading partners.\nUS clean energy investments recently increased, ignited by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. The law offers tax benefits for the business sector and rebates for households to incentivise the installation of clean energy systems, especially solar cell products, to reduce carbon emissions and electricity costs.\nThe impact of the US CVD measures may become evident this year, when US renewable energy operators could consider changing their trade partners to avoid the tariffs.\nThe extent of the impact depends on the timing and results of Thai manufacturers' submission of evidence to the US authorities in the investigation.\nAlthough some Thai solar cell manufacturers may face higher costs for export as a result of CVDs, other producers determined to have not received a subsidy can maintain their competitiveness in the export market.\nTreerat Sirichantaropas, chief executive of New Energy Plus, the distributor of solar panels made by Shanghai-based Jinko Solar Holding, said CVDs would not discourage local manufacturers from exporting solar cells products because they can export low-cost solar panels to markets other than the US.\nHe said the DOC's move is a trade barrier, similar to that imposed on electric vehicles made by Chinese companies.\nHowever, the real concern among Thai solar product manufacturers may not be the CVD probe, but rather tough competition from Chinese rivals, said Mr Treerat.\nQ: How is the Commerce Ministry reacting?\nThe Foreign Trade Department, which protects the interests of exporters, is monitoring the progress of the investigation, said Noppadon Kuntamas, deputy director-general of the department.\nIn collaboration with relevant government agencies and the private sector, the department plans to gather evidence and information to file arguments in its defence against the US allegations, working with legal advisors with extensive trade dispute experience to ensure fairness in international trade competition.\nQ: What should the Thai private sector do in response?\nThai solar cell manufacturers should provide accurate and complete information, evidence and facts to the Foreign Trade Department to protect their interests.\nEntrepreneurs should adjust their business strategies in line with the changing business landscape, in particular trade policy, including developing value-added products and differentiating their products, expanding to other markets to diversify risk, and partnering with foreign companies to access technology and gain a wider distribution network.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat is your budget range for purchasing a house in Thailand?\nUnder 3 million THB\n3 million - 5 million THB\n5 million - 8 million THB\n8 million - 12 million THB\nOver 12 million THB\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nUS solar probe\nSoutheast Asia\nThailand\nCSPV\nDo you like the content of this article?\n24\n12\nCOMMENT\n(9)",

Centuries ago, China -- going by the name of the \"Middle Kingdom\" -- was the world's most influential nation until Western European countries arrived on the shores of the Chinese empire in the early 16th century.\nIn addition to being forced to open up the country to foreign trade and Western religions and ideals -- including those that impacted the relationship between the country's ruler and its citizens, by the mid-19th century, China was also confronted by Western military aggression and the imposition of extra-territorial treaties. If that was not enough, China was defeated by Japan, a small island country existing on the fringes of Chinese civilisation. Submission to Japan and Western powers was a double humiliation for China. Loss of pride has subsequently shaped the country's pursuit to regain its top position on the global stage.\nDuring the past five decades, China has developed dramatically, recently becoming the world's second-biggest economy after the United States. The country has relentlessly strived to be the world's number one -- a coveted position that could help it vanquish the \"Century of Humiliation\" and restore its rightful place in the world.\nADVERTISEMENT\nChina's ability to be powerful and influential relies on multiple factors, including strength at home and its rapport throughout the world. Both factors allow China to share ideas and assist other countries in projects that lead to common development, prosperity and security.\nRELATED\nworld\nChinese student loses over B2.3m to Hong Kong scammers who told her to go to Thailand\nworld\nChina says&nbsp;Philippines&nbsp;has 'provoked trouble' in S.China Sea with US backing\nIn terms of its military, China has modernised its armed forces on all fronts -- not only for activities within the planet but also in outer space. The country has become the most powerful state within the Asia-Pacific region through its combination of nuclear weapons, conventional weapons and cyber-space military technologies. Additionally, it has slowly but steadily expanded its military presence from the Western Pacific through the whole of the Pacific and Indian Oceans. It would not be surprising to eventually see the Chinese fleet in the Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea.\nIn terms of trade and investment, China has expanded its impactful presence around the world through the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) by using its Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) to enhance state, investment, and people-to-people contact and exchanges.\nChinese investors and the government have together successfully positioned themselves as a global factory, with Chinese-made products being shipped with monumental scope across all continents, making China the No.1 trading partner of most countries. It has also become the top provider through a combination of grants and concession loans to many developing countries around the world. Loans and grants from China have been used for the construction and modernisation of transport infrastructure such as deep-sea ports and airports, roads, railways and public buildings.\nChina prides itself on its development model, namely a one-party authoritarian system and a mixed economy of state-led enterprises and private companies. China has promoted its model to developing countries in opposition to the Western system of multi-party competition and a market economy.\nAdditionally, China has joined hands with Brazil, Russia, India, and South Africa in forming the Brics group to enhance intra-economic activities, including the creation of the New Development Bank (NDB). Brics membership has been expanding, with multiple countries applying to join.\nTherefore, it could be said that China has been taking on a global leadership role, a challenge to the dominance of Western powers. The country is also providing alternatives for developing countries to end their reliance on the Western world. The AIIB and the NDB, as well as the programme to utilise its national currency instead of the US dollar, is a challenge to international and regional organisations founded by Western countries and alliances such as the World Bank, the IMF, the Group of Seven (G7) and the Asian Development Bank (ADB). In short, developing countries within the Global South, seeking leverage and bargaining chips, have two options -- the West's G7 or Brics.\nDespite the benefits provided by China to the Global South, not everything is roses. Offerings under the BRI and AIIB come with strings attached. There are many stories of countries going bankrupt for defaulting on loans after various infrastructure projects built by China's loans were not fiscally viable. These countries then have to give up authority and ownership to Chinese creditors to clear debts. There have been many accusations and reports of corruption and under-the-table payments that Chinese officials have given to political leaders in countries to accept these loans, although these projects were destined to fail from the start.\nWhen the international community or countries criticise China about these matters, China responds by punishing such countries economically, either through trade embargoes or the prohibition of Chinese tourists, as well as suspension of bilateral cooperative programmes and activities. Such coercive tactics are not limited to developing countries, as the international community has also witnessed similar strategies used against the Philippines and Vietnam in the South China Sea over their overlapping territorial claims, claims by each country that have been upheld in the international court of law.\nIn terms of the environment, China has been criticised for controlling international rivers flowing from it towards the Bay of Bengal and the South China Sea by constantly expanding water and dam projects upstream. These upstream water infrastructure projects allow China to utilise the flow of these essential waters as a proverbial Sword of Damocles over countries downstream.\nIt should be recalled that China previously annexed Tibet and has more or less ended any form of democratic life in Hong Kong, in spite of its agreement with the UK, while also threatening the very survival of Taiwan.\nThe international community is witnessing the two characteristics of China. On the one hand, there is a benevolent China that helps emancipate developing nations in the Global South from the grips of the Western world. On the other hand, there is a China that is aggressive and confrontational, which is not conducive to world peace and common prosperity.\nIn terms of trade, China has been criticised for not acting fairly towards its trading partners and for inducing fear and anxiety.\nChina must dispel this perception. There should be only one Chinese character, that of the kind and attentive \"uncle\" next door.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat type of building do you prefer for a condominium?\nHigh-rise (more than 10 floors)\nMid-rise (5-10 floors)\nLow-rise (less than 5 floors)\nNo preference\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nChina\nGeopolitics\nInvating\nInvate\nTrade\nNegotiation\nDo you like the content of this article?\n18\n81\nCOMMENT\n(28)",

If it is difficult to decipher the country on some fronts, there are other elements which are more accessible. While it might be easy to look at its impressive growth in recent decades as diverging from other global players in key areas, there are other areas which are mutually convergent. From the multidimensional panorama of a complex world -- the \"multiplex\" world, a preferred approach is not to generalise too much but to analyse the specifics of our times for possible confluence.\nChina's current policy and related vision towards the world community can be seen from the communique issued by the national authorities at its Third Plenum gathering in July 2024. It harks back to the earlier Five-Sphere Integrated Plan and Four-Pronged Comprehensive Strategy which project socialism with Chinese characteristics in the economic, political, civil, social and cultural development, based on harmony between societies.\nIn the background for over a decade, its Belt and Road Initiative has been a key player linking up with some 150 countries worldwide through massive infrastructure projects, such as construction of railways, and extractive industries, such as mining in various parts of the world, with Chinese finance and loans undergirding this strategic outreach.\nADVERTISEMENT\nRecently, due to critiques about environmental impacts and debt traps which await various countries borrowing too easily from their counterpart, there is now more consciousness of the need for environmental impact assessment and more rigid financial planning to address the debt issue.\nFor instance, China has now issued green finance guidelines for a more accountable process based on ESG (environmental, social, governance), as well as the opening for grievance mechanisms to accept complaints from affected communities in regard to ecological harm. There have been tens of thousands of cases in the country where communities have lodged complaints against the authorities for environmental damage, such as a key case in Gansu province where a conservation organisation took the local state enterprise to court for failing to use renewable energy -- and won.\nRELATED\nsports\nKunlavut and Pornpawee march into quarter-finals\nthailand\nThailand Debut: JY AIR Redefines Smart Electric Travel&nbsp;\nMore recently, three initiatives emerged to complement that vision: the Global Development Initiative (GDI), the Global Security Initiative (GSI), and, most recently, the Global Civilization Initiative (GCI).\nThe GDI promotes shared values premised on people, with a stronger commitment to address climate change, green development, the digital economy, and connectivity. The GSI calls for sustained security based on respect for national sovereignty and territorial integrity of states, with peaceful dispute settlement through dialogue. It tackles both traditional security (such as armed conflicts) and non-traditional security (such as the drug issue and cybercrime).\nPerhaps the most intriguing initiative is the GCI, which counters the perspective of the \"clash of civilisations\" by projecting inclusiveness among civilisations, unity in diversity, and people-to-people exchanges. It is linked with another phrase that appears in the political discourse: \"the community of common destiny\", anchored on respect for the diversity of civilisations, dialogue, common values, and innovation.\nIn a way, it envisions human rights interaction based on cooperation rather than fragmentation. Of course, all this has to be tested in reality in a multilateral setting to assess the country's substantive respect for human rights, democracy, peace and sustainable development. There is a persistent need to ensure compliance with civil and political rights in concert with economic, social and cultural rights, as well as to broaden the spaces for a variety of stakeholders, including minorities and those who have viewpoints differing from the majority or the administration.\nOn the development of trade and commerce, while it is easy to focus on trade-related conflicts based on inter-state competition and rivalry as China began to grow as a magnum force in these relations, partly as a result of its membership in the World Trade Organization (WTO), the country has been supportive of key developments in building a rules-based trading system.\nIn 2022, it supported the finalisation of the Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies. Basically, this multilateral agreement seeks to regulate harmful fisheries and the subsidies behind them, especially where they are detrimental to the environment and are exploitative of the system; this is best exemplified by action needed against illegal, unreported and unlicensed fishing. It targets action against overfished stocks and has a notification system aiming for transparency, as well as a dispute settlement mechanism.\nThis year's more recent WTO-related Investment Facilitation for Development Agreement is a plurilateral agreement with some but not all members of the WTO joining, and China has been supportive of the development. It aims to reduce paperwork to facilitate investment, thus minimising transaction costs, and promotes cross-border cooperation, even though it does not deal with market access. Its facilitative approach does not delve into the sensitive area of investor-state dispute settlement (between states and foreign investors), and this has to be dealt with by other channels. Yet, the agreement enables countries to act in concert to simplify some of the barriers facing the globalisation of investment and opens the door for more assistance to developing countries.\nThe country has also been supportive of the WTO's dispute settlement mechanism as a whole, even though the appellate process of the latter has been blocked by divergences between international stakeholders. While the country has tried to maximise its access to outside markets as it moves rapidly to a green economy, with an impressive surge of electric vehicles for exports, some importing countries claiming oversupply are imposing tariffs to counter the influx. In that relationship, China still uses the WTO as a means of dispute resolution. Most recently, in the middle of 2024, there was a complaint against the European Union regarding the latter's action against subsidies concerning imported cars. A pervasive issue is thus transparency and fair play, closely linked with the role of state enterprises and related subsidies.\nIn sum, while there are difficulties along the development path, areas of confluence are welcome, particularly with the greater call for a green transition and the economy through peaceful processes with intergenerational implications.\nVitit Muntarbhorn\nChulalongkorn University Professor\nVitit Muntarbhorn is a Professor Emeritus at the Faculty of Law, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand.

Instead, Bangladesh's prime minister resigned and fled to neighbouring India, ending her 15-year-long rule as chaos has engulfed the nation. The army wasted no time stepping in to form an interim government, although what shape that will take is still unclear.\nThe military needs to find a swift path to a peaceful transfer of power. Any delay will risk damaging the country's reputation with the international financial community even further -- at a time when Dhaka needs funds and investment to revive its flailing economy. Stability in a region that has long lived under the shadow of violent extremism is also under threat, while the chaos will present an opportunity for China, whose ambitions have so far been well-balanced against India's under Ms Hasina's regime.\nOnce among the most impoverished countries in the world, Bangladesh witnessed a remarkable turnaround in recent years. A young and energetic workforce helped make it the world's second-largest clothing exporter behind China, manufacturing for large fashion brands like Hennes &amp; Mauritz AB, Gap Inc. and Inditex SA's Zara. In 2022, it was on course to become a US$1 trillion economy by 2040, according to the Boston Consulting Group.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe good times didn't last. A combination of the pandemic and financial mismanagement took their toll on the emerging economy, and two years ago, it reached out to the International Monetary Fund and other international lenders to prevent collapse. It's the third country in the region, after Sri Lanka and Pakistan, forced to knock on the IMF's door in recent times. All the instability is adding to uncertainty in South Asia.\nRELATED\nopinion\nBangladesh's youth uprising has Arab Spring echoes\nworld\nTwelve killed as Bangladesh goes to the polls\nFinancial health was not the only issue. The protests over the last month have been a lightning rod for an array of problems from acute unemployment to a flagging private sector, Lutfey Siddiqi, visiting professor at the London School of Economics' foreign policy think tank, said. \"There's also anger at the sheer lack of empathy and condescension with which Hasina has responded to those worries.\"\nThe prime minister's ruling Awami League has been in power since 2009, but elections have been regularly boycotted by the opposition, and widely condemned as being insufficiently free and fair. She capitalised on a storied legacy as the daughter of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, Bangladesh's founding father, going on to become the world's longest-serving female leader, but in recent years has clamped down on press freedom and quashed public debate. Economic mismanagement has only made grievances worse.\nHer entrance into political life was marked by personal tragedy. Ms Hasina's father was assassinated in a coup in 1975 when she was 28. The army murdered 18 people that day, including her parents and three siblings. Ms Hasina, who was in Germany at the time, fled to India with her sister and lived in exile there until she returned home in the 1980s. She was in and out of home detention until 1996 when she first became prime minister.\nMs Hasina was credited for bringing much-needed stability and turning the economy around. But in the last decade, her rule was marked by protests against an increasingly authoritarian regime. More recently, police launched a brutal crackdown on demonstrators who have been on the streets since June to voice their discontent over a proposed government jobs quota. More than 100 people died last weekend, adding to the toll of at least 300 since citizen anger flared. The rage has morphed into something deeper -- a disillusionment with Ms Hasina's government that many among the 170 million strong population view as corrupt and ineffective. There are regional implications for Ms Hasina's dramatic exit. It puts renewed pressure on India, which has relied on her to keep potential terrorist threats at bay as well as provide a bulwark to China's growing influence in the region. New Delhi will be worried about who will replace her, what that will mean for security risks on its border, and the new government's relations with Beijing.\nChina is Bangladesh's largest trading partner. In 2022, trade between the two grew by 10.7% to $27.79 billion from $12 billion in 2014. Dhaka was the first South Asian country to join the Belt and Road Initiative, Beijing's ambitious global infrastructure programme. In July, Bangladesh asked for a $5 billion loan from Beijing to help it grow its economy. In the current power vacuum, the US will be mindful of China's appeal. American officials have for too long turned a blind eye to Ms Hasina's growing autocracy in an attempt to keep her on side. That could come back to haunt them.\nFor now though, it will be domestic considerations that will dominate -- and rightly so. The country has to begin the difficult process of rebuilding. The first tasks for a new government will be quelling the protests and steadying the economy. Negotiations with the IMF for more funds in the face of dwindling foreign exchange reserves should be a priority. The military needs to get out of the way, and convince citizens that it is serious about putting together a new administration and calling for fresh elections. The people of Bangladesh have spoken, and they want a bigger say in their future.

(Photo: Reuters)\nTensions between the United States and China continue to flare, even as Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, Secretary of State Antony Blinken, and several other senior US officials visit the country for talks. The two sides may disagree on most things, but maintaining dialogue is an essential part of geopolitics. The breakdown in communication last year, following visits to Taiwan by prominent American politicians and the US downing of a Chinese spy balloon, was dangerous and destabilising, because when adversaries do not engage, misperceptions -- and the risk of a clash -- mount.\nBut, midway through 2024, dialogue is proving unable to bridge deep divides. This major superpower conflict looks set to continue and may even worsen as positions on the war in Ukraine, national security concerns, and trade tensions harden into a long-term standoff. Global institutions, forums, and solutions will be among the biggest losers in an ongoing US-China decoupling, while regional alliances will increase in importance.\nSome weakness was evident at the World Bank and International Monetary Fund spring meetings in Washington. The International Monetary and Financial Committee did not issue a communiqu\u00e9, as it normally would, because China and its allies refused to include a reference to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. US and European shareholders, for their part, wanted to recognise the war and its impact. The resulting silence was a victory for both Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe G20 has also become more divided and less effective. In contrast to 2008-09, when G20 leaders quickly forged a coordinated response to the global financial crisis, the group currently lacks the collective will to address crises and achieve common goals. To be sure, the G20 still holds annual summits and technical experts have made progress in some areas. But Russia's invasion of Crimea in 2014 opened fissures in the group, which have only deepened in the years since. Consequently, the G20 is no longer the principal forum for global diplomacy.\nRELATED\nthailand\nEx-PM proposes reforms amid global shifts\nbusiness\nFinnomena touts US, India and Vietnam for investment\nMeanwhile, the enlarged Brics+ forum, an initiative pushed by China, seeks to counter American influence, especially now that the US is caught in what Graham Allison calls the Thucydides Trap -- the tendency towards war when an emerging power threatens to displace a regional or international hegemon.\nBy putting new Brics in the wall -- the group now includes Egypt, Ethiopia, Saudi Arabia, Iran, and the United Arab Emirates, in addition to Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa -- China is trying to build an alternative world order, in which the Global South has greater geopolitical, economic, and diplomatic heft. In 2024, the Brics+ countries account for around 36% of global GDP and 45% of the world's population. While its members do not always -- or even often -- agree, they are shifting power away from the US and its allies, especially in the IMF, the World Bank, the G20, and the United Nations, where they promote China's positions.\nThe expanded group is buttressed by the New Development Bank, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, and huge resource transfers, valued at roughly $1 trillion (36.77 trillion baht), through China's Belt and Road Initiative to partners around the world. These are part of China's efforts to construct its own global financial architecture that will support its goals and compete with the European-led IMF and the US-led World Bank.\nWhether China will succeed in coordinating the Global South is unclear. America certainly hopes not. But others see Brics+ as a new global economic paradigm. The reality is somewhere in between, although the US seems to be falling out of favour.\nTellingly, the US has responded to China's growing might by taking a step backwards and attempting to reinvigorate the G7, an unrepresentative group that is no longer as effective or relevant as it once was. To be sure, a forum for Western allies is necessary. But the notion that a group as small as the G7 can advance global goals at a time of heightened tensions and hardening stances is fanciful. Moreover, the G7 is far from united: despite US pressure, its members have been unable to agree on commandeering Russia's frozen assets.\nWhile the exact impact of the changing geopolitical balance remains unknown, it is clearly becoming an impediment to addressing global challenges, whether related to climate change, migration, disease, or other worldwide crises. We are entering a period of deteriorating US-China relations, with each side backed by its own allies and operating in its own international forums. As the risk of a great-power confrontation increases, the window of opportunity for solving humanity's most pressing problems is closing fast.\n\u00a92024 Project Syndicate\nWilliam R Rhodes, President of William R Rhodes Global Advisers LLC, is the author of 'Banker to the World: Leadership Lessons From the Front Lines of Global Finance' (McGraw Hill, 2011).

(Reuters photo)\nChinese President Xi Jinping arrived in France on Sunday to begin a closely watched three-nation tour that will see him try to improve relations with Europe amid intensifying US rivalry, with trade and Ukraine high on the agenda.\nAccompanying Xi on his first European tour in five years is his wife Peng Liyuan, chief of staff Cai Qi, and Foreign Minister Wang Yi, according to a statement from Beijing. The five-day trip will also take Xi to Serbia and Hungary.\nThe delegation is expected to spend two days in France, with Xi to meet President Emmanuel Macron and the European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen in Paris on Monday, ahead of a state dinner.\nADVERTISEMENT\nAds powered by\nMacron and von der Leyen, who has been invited by the French president to join the meeting with Xi, are expected to bring up some of the thorniest issues in China-EU relations. This includes the bloc's long-standing concerns over a nearly 300 billion euro (US$323 billion) trade deficit and alleged Chinese supplies of dual-use goods to Russia that benefit its military assaults on Ukraine.\nRELATED\nbusiness\nRestaurants worry over New Year disappointment\nbusiness\nThai stock index continues its downward trend\nThe European Union has stepped up its \"de-risking\" approach to address economic overdependence on China, and what it calls Beijing's increasing geopolitical \"assertiveness\" as relations with the West worsen.\nThe drive includes probes targeting China's clean energy industry - where it has emerged as a global leader - involving products including electric vehicles, solar panels and wind turbines, with Beijing accused of \"flooding\" the European market with heavily subsidised cheaper products.\nMacron, who is known for his pro-European approach, is a major supporter of the bloc's tougher economic measures against China. He is also believed to be a proponent of the EU's anti-subsidy probe into Chinese EVs, which has prompted Beijing to retaliate with a similar investigation into French brandy.\nIn an interview to the French newspaper La Tribune published on Saturday, Macron said he would press Xi on economic reciprocity.\n\"In Europe, we are not unanimous on the subject because certain players still see China as essentially a market of opportunities. I'm calling for an 'aggiornamento' because China is now in excess capacity in many areas and exports massively to Europe,\" Macron said, using the Italian word for update.\nMacron added that China's role was crucial on international issues where Europe needed its engagement, whether it was climate change, or security issues concerning Ukraine, North Korea or Iran. Conflicts in the Middle East are also expected to be discussed in the meeting with Xi.\n\"I am not suggesting we move away from China,\" Macron told La Tribune. However, I think that we must better protect our national security, our sovereignty, de-risk a part of our supply chains and be much more realistic in defending our interests.\"\nMacron, a defender of Europe's \"strategic autonomy\" amid the US-China rivalry, is often seen as striking a delicate balance while launching a \"charm offensive\" on China, despite US pressure.\nDuring his visit to China last year, Macron was accompanied by a large business delegation and brought home a number of significant deals in nuclear energy, aviation, and agriculture, even though he was unsuccessful in persuading Xi to jointly act on Russia.\nXi's visit will see France seek to further boost agricultural exports to China, and also repeat the plea for Beijing to use its influence on Moscow, including on negotiating a potential truce during the Paris Olympic Games starting late July, according to Macron and his officials.\nChina has yet to condemn Russia's invasion of Ukraine and is criticised by the West for siding with Moscow due to their close ties. Russian President Vladimir Putin is reportedly due to visit China shortly after Xi returns from Europe.\nChina insists it has a neutral stance in the war and is using its own methods to bring peace to Ukraine, including efforts for direct talks between the two sides at next month's global peace summit in Switzerland.\nOn Tuesday, Macron is expected to bring Xi to the Pyrenees mountains on the Spanish border, a place the French president holds dear as his grandmother's birthplace and where he spent his childhood holidays.\nAccording to French media, the personal gesture aims to echo Xi's decision to host a tea ceremony for Macron at the former residence of his father in southern China.\nIn an opinion piece published on state-run CGTN on Sunday, Chinese envoy to France Lu Shaye said relations with France were \"at the forefront of China's relations with Western countries\". It is hoped France's \"independent\" policy towards China would open up more cooperation while resolving mutual \"differences\" as the two countries mark 60 years of diplomatic ties, Lu wrote.\nChina has long called on the EU to remain strategically independent of US policy, as more members of the 27-nation bloc follow Washington in imposing economic and technological restrictions on China.\nMany see Xi's trip as an attempt by China to regain the trust of Europe, while driving a wedge between the US and its allies as cracks begin to show over US security commitment to Ukraine.\nXi's next stops - the Russia-friendly Serbia and Hungary - both have strained relations with the United States.\nXi's trip to Serbia coincides with the 25th anniversary of the Nato bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade.\nHe also aims to strengthen partnerships with both central European countries under the Belt and Road Initiative, the funding and infrastructure strategy criticised by the West as China's flagship project to reshape the global order.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat is your budget range for renting a condominium?\nUnder 10,000 THB/month\n10,000 - 20,000 THB/month\n20,000 - 40,000 THB/month\n40,000 - 60,000 THB/month\nOver 60,000 THB/month\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nChinese president\nXi\nVisit\nFrance\nEurope\nChina\nUnited States\nRelations\nRivalry\nDo you like the content of this article?\n7\n18\nCOMMENT\n(9)",

Like many infrastructure projects, it could potentially be used for military purposes and is drawing similar concerns from neighbour Vietnam.&nbsp;\nThere are worries that the project could support the transport of military ships from the Gulf of Thailand where Washington believes China is building its first overseas base in the Indo-Pacific region \u2014 and also concerns about the canal\u2019s environmental impact, including that it will direct water away from the Mekong river.\n\u201cWe urge authorities to coordinate closely with the Mekong River Commission to provide additional project details and to participate fully in any appropriate environmental impact studies to help the MRC and member countries fully understand, assess, and prepare for any possible impacts of the project,\u201d Holzer said.\nVietnam also expressed environmental concerns and said that it \u201crequests Cambodian side to coordinate closely with Vietnam and other countries in sharing information and assessing the impact of this project\u201d on water resources and the environment, Doan Khac Viet, deputy spokesperson of Vietnam\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said during a press briefing on Thursday.\nChina\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThe project comes as Prime Minister Hun Manet has deepened already close ties with Beijing since taking the reins from his father less than a year ago. Cambodia\u2019s relationship with the US remains rocky, with considerable strain over a range of issues including human rights, press freedom and the suppression of political opposition.\nWashington has repeatedly expressed concern over what it sees as the growing influence of China\u2019s military in the country, including the Beijing-supported redevelopment of the Ream Naval Base, something US Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs Daniel Kritenbrink raised with officials during a visit earlier this year.\nMilitary experts say the canal \u201cwill create the necessary depth, enough for military ships to travel from the Gulf of Thailand, or from the Ream base, deep into the interior,\u201d Vietnam\u2019s state-controlled People\u2019s Public Security Political Academy published on its website last month, citing external research. \u201cThe Funan Techo Canal is not simply a socio-economic development project but also has great military value and has a strong impact on the defence and security situation of the entire region.\u201d\nHun Sen, who is now president of Cambodia\u2019s senate, on Tuesday meanwhile dismissed unspecified \u201cslanderous reports about the presence of Chinese troops at the Ream,\u201d from \u201cnon-friends\u201d who he said are now twisting the real use of the canal.\n\u201cWhy would Cambodia bring Chinese troops into its country, which violates the constitution? And why would China bring its troops to Cambodia, which is contrary to the principle of respect for Cambodia\u2019s independence?\u201d he wrote in a post on X. \u201cThis vital infrastructure facilitates agricultural activities by providing water for crop cultivation, is good for water management during the rainy season, and increases freshwater fish production, among other benefits.\u201d\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat type of accommodation do you usually prefer when traveling in Thailand?\nLuxury hotels (5-star)\nMid-range hotels (3-4 star)\nHostels and guesthouses\nPrivate rentals (Airbnb or villas)\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nUs\nThailand\nCambodia\nVietnam\nChina\nCanal\nMilitary\nDo you like the content of this article?\n6\n26\nCOMMENT\n(10)",

Addressing this urgent issue requires a comprehensive and multi-sectoral approach that includes prioritising waste management strategies to prevent ocean-bound waste and performing regular cleanups.\nThis rationale underpins the initiative by The Ocean Cleanup, a Dutch non-profit environmental engineering organisation led by Mr. Boyan Slat, its CEO and founder. On 26 March 2024, in Bangkok, Thailand, The Ocean Cleanup, in collaboration with its first global implementation partner, The Coca-Cola Company, and various local partners, the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment, the Department of Marine and Coastal Resources, The Bangkok Metropolitan Administration (BMA), Marine Department, Expressway Authority of Thailand (EXAT), the Embassy of the Netherlands in Thailand,\nEcomarine Company Limited, Asian Marine Services Public Company Limited, and Chulalongkorn University, officially deployed the Interceptor\nTM\n019. This solar-powered and fully automated waste capturing device was unveiled on the Chao Phraya River in Bangkok, marking a significant step forward in Thailand and the region. Interceptor\nTM\n019\u2019s deployment aims to remove waste from the Chao Phraya River and study plastic pollution in Bangkok\u2019s waterways, seeking solutions for marine pollution and waste management in Thailand.\nPol. Gen. Patcharawat Wongsuwan, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Natural Resources and Environment, stated, \u201cThe ministry is committed to incorporating environmental concerns into the national agenda for sustainable development. Initiatives like the installation of Interceptor\nTM\n019 in the Chao Phraya River are crucial in managing natural resources, protecting the environment, and addressing Thailand\u2019s plastic waste challenges.\u201d\nH.E. Mr. Remco Johannes van Wijngaarden, Ambassador of the Kingdom of the Netherlands to Thailand, commented, \u201cThis is a significant milestone. The sea is still full of plastics, and much remains to be done. The Embassy of the Netherlands is pleased to collaborate with organisations such as The Ocean Cleanup and Coca-Cola\n\u00ae\n. Through collective action and innovation, we can best tackle the challenge of marine plastic pollution.\nMr. Chadchart Sittipunt, Bangkok Governor, remarked, \u201cThe whole world is connected by waterways. The deployment of Interceptor\nTM\n019 signifies a major step toward cooperation and serves as a poignant reminder to protect our planet more diligently, recognising that every piece of trash has an owner and prompting a change in people\u2019s behaviour towards greater environmental consciousness.\u201d\nMr. Boyan Slat, Founder and CEO of The Ocean Cleanup, stated, \u201cA significant portion of marine debris originates from land-based sources, making its way into canals, rivers, and ultimately the oceans. It is estimated that approximately 1,000 rivers account for 80% of oceanic plastic pollution. To combat this, it is vital to clean up existing debris and prevent new plastic from entering the oceans. Deploying the Interceptor\nTM\n&nbsp;019 represents a crucial step towards mitigating plastic pollution in Bangkok\u2019s waters. Through collaboration with governments and the private sector, our goal is to address the top 1,000 polluting rivers worldwide by 2025.\u201d\n\u201cThis deployment is just the beginning in partnership with Bangkok authorities and our other collaborators,\u201d emphasised the CEO of The Ocean Cleanup.\nMr. Victor Wong, Vice President and General Manager of Coca-Cola Thailand, Myanmar, and Laos, remarked, \u201cWe care about the impact of every package we put into the market. As part of our \u2018World Without Waste\u2019 vision, The Coca-Cola Company is working globally to ensure the equivalent of every bottle and can we sell is collected and recycled by 2030. The partnership that we\u2019ve fostered with The Ocean Cleanup over the past two years has reached a milestone moment in Thailand with the implementation of the innovative Interceptor technology in Bangkok\u2019s renowned Chao Phraya River. The insights gained from our collaboration in Bangkok will help inform the roll-out of this technology in countries around the world. We are happy to be providing our support as we test and learn.\u201d\nThe Interceptor\nTM\n019 is the fifth installation in Southeast Asia by The Ocean Cleanup, following installations in Malaysia, Vietnam, and Indonesia. In collaboration with Coca-Cola\n\u00ae\n, The Ocean Cleanup has also installed Interceptors in Guatemala, the Dominican Republic, and Los Angeles, USA.\nSituated near the Commemoration of H.M. the King\u2019s 6\nth\nCycle Birthday Park, on Rama 3 Road, Bangkok, the Interceptor\nTM\n019 is strategically placed within a key 16-kilometre stretch of the Chao Phraya River. This area, where 61 canals converge, often carries plastic debris into the river.\nThe data collected by Interceptor\nTM\n019 will be analysed to identify the types of plastic waste in the Chao Phraya River and to develop long-term solutions for marine pollution. Additionally, methods for extracting and capturing plastic waste floating on the water\u2019s surface will be explored to prevent it from reaching the final 50-kilometre stretch of the Chao Phraya River, which flows into the Gulf of Thailand and the ocean beyond.\nDesigned for mass production and rapid deployment in the world\u2019s most polluted rivers, the Interceptor\nTM\n019, measuring 22.39 metres in length, 8.78 metres in width, and 5.58 metres in height, utilises solar energy for fully automated waste capture. This innovative machine is equipped with a conveyor belt, shuttle, lights, six dumpster bins, sensors, data transmission, and solar panels.\nAs debris flows with the river\u2019s current into the Interceptor, it collects performance data and alerts operators when the dumpsters are full. Its large storage capacity ensures efficient waste removal, allowing for the filling of entire garbage trucks in one go. Each Interceptor can collect between 50,000 to 100,000 pieces of debris daily.\nFollowing an invitation by the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment in 2019, discussions led to the successful deployment of Interceptor\nTM\n019 on the Chao Phraya River in 2024, in cooperation with the BMA. A five-year contract with Thailand has been initiated, with potential for extension.\nThe Chao Phraya River, a vital watercourse for the city, sustains the livelihoods of numerous communities and is crucial for the 11 million residents of Bangkok.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat is your budget range for purchasing a condominium?\nEkkamai-Thong Lor\nSathorn-Silom\nChidlom-Siam\nBang Na\nChinatown\nAri\nRiverside\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nDo you like the content of this article?\n31\n3\nCOMMENT\n(5)",

Indonesia is building a new capital in Nusantara on Borneo island to reduce the burden of Jakarta. (Photo: Reuters)\nHONG KONG: China is positioning itself to become one of the top foreign investors in Nusantara, the planned new capital of Indonesia that is being built from scratch over the next 20 years in the middle of forests and palm tree farms.\nThe investment is expected to become the stand-out showpiece in a growing body of work building smart cities and other landmark urban zones in other countries, analysts said.\nThe projects in turn would help China connect with friendly nations to facilitate trade, they added, giving Chinese construction firms a chance to prove themselves abroad.\nADVERTISEMENT\n\"It's fair to say that China has the strongest squad of engineers and constructors, who have benefited from the country's building boom since the mid-2000s,\" said Xu Tianchen, a senior China-based economist with the Economist Intelligence Unit.\n\"China is also experienced in providing full life cycle solutions, from financing to construction and maintenance, which make life easier for host countries.\"\nRELATED\nbusiness\nChina's BYD opens EV factory in Thailand, first in Southeast Asia\nthailand\nThe 97km that frustrate China's mastery of the Mekong\nBeijing-based state-owned builder Citic Construction has expressed interest in developing 60 residential towers in Nusantara, which is set to replace flood-prone Jakarta as the national capital.\nThe move had been delayed due to the coronavirus pandemic, but government offices may be relocated this year as officials seek to reduce the burden on Jakarta.\n\"I'm not surprised that China will invest a lot in Indonesia, including [Nusantara], because the Indonesian minister of investment has said that doing business with China is easy and they are not fussy about asking for various requirements like other countries,\" said Nukila Evanty, a Jakarta-based member of the Asia Centre research institute's \u00adadvisory board.\nBuilding cities for other countries also naturally follows China's 45-year \"leap\" in its own urban development, as well as the goals of its Belt and Road Initiative, said Victor Gao, vice-president of the Centre for China and Globalisation in Beijing.\nBeijing's signature Belt and Road Initiative has spawned China-funded infrastructure projects in scores of countries, including ports, highways and power plants.\nConstruction of smart cities - a term that usually refers to technology-aided management of traffic and urban resources - advances China's goal of increasing \"connectivity\", especially in countries near its borders such as in Southeast Asia, Gao said.\nChinese-funded projects in Nusantara - which is located on the east coast of the island of Borneo - would follow work in Africa, the Middle East and elsewhere in Asia.\nIn Egypt, Chinese contractors built much of the New Administrative Capital government centre, Egyptian Hong Kong-based consul general Baher Sheweikhi previously told the South China Morning Post. The new capital includes one of the African nation's tallest skyscrapers.\nSeveral Chinese companies are also helping construct Egypt's New Alamein, a city designed to accommodate autonomous shared cars and public transport systems, Xu added.\nChina is also taking part in the construction of Neom in Saudi Arabia, which officials call a \"futuristic\" development. Chinese firms have worked on tunnels, solar power stations and water desalination projects, Xu said.\nIn 2019, China and Kenya signed a US$665 million deal to help build \"smart cities\" in the African nation, with Chinese telecommunications equipment giant Huawei Technologies nominated to carry out the work.\nAnd in 2020, Alibaba Cloud - Alibaba Group Holding's cloud computing unit - received clearance in 2020 to install hardware for Kuala Lumpur's smart city system that is designed to collect and integrate real-time data from traffic cameras. Alibaba is the owner of the\nSouth China Morning Post\n.\nChina already ranks as Indonesia's second-largest investor after Singapore following a steep climb over the past decade, with combined direct investment from mainland China and Hong Kong in 2023 of US$13.9 billion.\n\"Chinese construction companies are increasingly competitive worldwide, in terms of expertise,\" said Zha Daojiong, an international studies professor at Peking University.\nAnd while countries have their own property developers, Chinese firms may carry out higher-quality work, Gao added.\nThe output value of China's construction industry topped 31 trillion yuan (US$4.3 trillion) in 2022, according to\nPeople's Daily\n.\nThe projects in Nusantara are also significant for China because Indonesia is Southeast Asia's largest country, a member of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership trade pact and an original member of the Belt and Road Initiative, said Zhao Xijun, a finance professor at Renmin University in Beijing.\nAnd a US$7.3 billion, 142km high-speed railway built by a Chinese-invested consortium on the populous island of Java, which opened last year, should be seen as a \"model\" for what China can do, Zhao added.\n\"That's a very successful cooperation project in terms of investment in Indonesia,\" Zhao said.\nThe Nusantara Capital City Authority estimated that domestic firms have committed US$2.2 billion toward building the future capital versus a total cost of about US$30 billion - leaving plenty of space for foreign investors.\nBut Chinese investments in the development of foreign cities comes with risks of delays, overruns, financing and social stability, analysts added.\nOfficials in Beijing are watching Belt and Road Initiative partners for any \"country-specific risks\", linked to economic trends and social stability, Zhao said, although Indonesia is considered \"low risk\", he added.\nBut China would still stay on alert for \"significant delays and cost overruns\" on the Indonesian capital construction projects, Xu said.\nChinese contractors experienced delays and overruns on the Java high-speed railway, he added.\nHe said some Indonesian citizens and officials already resent China over past disputes over mining projects.\nBeijing's role in Nusantara would face particular scrutiny if the Indonesian government provides the public little information about Chinese investment, Evanty added, pointing to a perception that Chinese workers take jobs away from locals.\n\"A few people tend to be xenophobic towards workers from China, especially in disadvantaged areas where unemployment and poverty are high and where there is Chinese investment,\" she said.\n//////////\nTrucks are seen near a palm oil plantation at a village located near Indonesia's projected new capital, known as Nusantara National Capital, in Sepaku, East Kalimantan province, Indonesia, on March 8 2023.

(Photo: Bloomberg)\nWASHINGTON - An ambitious project to link the emerging industrial powers of South Asia with Europe and beyond is moving at two speeds, illustrating the difficulty of aligning aspirations for one of the world\u2019s longest trade routes during a period of geopolitical turmoil.\nAfter signing on to the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC) agreement at the Group of 20 meetings in New Delhi in September, governments in the United States, the European Union (EU) and several European nations are bogged down financially and preoccupied diplomatically by two wars.\nMeanwhile, India and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) \u2014 two additional parties to the IMEC pact whose geopolitical alliances differ from those in Brussels and Washington \u2014 have taken swift action on infrastructure projects. Those include locking in a swath of port, railway and digital work during India Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s visit to Abu Dhabi in mid-February. India is pushing on domestic projects like a western railway to help move its exports swiftly to the Middle East.\nADVERTISEMENT\nFrom the UAE's perspective, talks about the trade corridor are still ongoing and progressing, according to a person familiar with the matter, having not been derailed by the Israel-Hamas war. The Gulf nation will aim to build on its relationships with all involved countries and particularly India, the person said, taking advantage of both existing and new infrastructure.\nThe UAE's Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not respond to a request for comment.&nbsp;\nRELATED\nbusiness\nSET lacks catalysts until year-end\nbusiness\nIEAT unveils plan to attract Chinese investment to Thailand\nThe ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict effectively stalled broader IMEC conversations as of Oct 7, especially as the normalisation of Israel-Saudi relations was a key goal to the US-led deal.&nbsp;\nWith the US mired in domestic debate over whether and how to secure more funding for Ukraine\u2019s defence against Russia, European officials are siphoning every bit of available funds to the cause. That leaves both with little energy and resources to devote to pressing ahead with IMEC. European officials have privately affirmed that there are other priorities in the Middle East right now.\nThe White House's National Security Council declined to comment.\nThe two conflicts are huge hurdles for the US and European goal of re-affirming the Western-led global order and offering an alternative to China, which has long made inroads in courting Global South countries on infrastructure.\n\"The EU needs to turn the project into a success as part of its efforts to counterbalance China's BRI \u2014 but it is struggling to dedicate financing and diplomatic firepower to move it along decisively,\" said Rym Momtaz, a Paris-based researcher for the International Institute for Strategic Studies, referring to China's Belt &amp; Road Initiative (BRI).\nIndia, the UAE, and other Middle Eastern nations are moving ahead for the economic benefits of securing fresh trade routes \u2014 especially as conflict in the Middle East that\u2019s stalled the project also has made IMEC ever more critical to supply chain resiliency.\nModi's outreach\nModi met with UAE leader Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan last month in Abu Dhabi, where the war and conflict in the Red Sea featured heavily in discussions, according to India's Foreign Secretary Vinay Kwatra.&nbsp;\nIndia's Prime Minister Narendra Modi addresses his supporters in Ahmedabad, India, on Tuesday. (Photo: Reuters)\nIn the same week, AD Ports Group, the Abu Dhabi logistics company, announced an agreement with the Indian transportation firm RITES Ltd and the Gujarat Maritime Board. The three agreed to develop new ports, railways and other infrastructure, as well as explore joint opportunities related to IMEC, AD Ports said in a statement.\nIndia also has cut deals and moved to shore up domestic infrastructure in the name of fulfilling their part of the IMEC vision.&nbsp;\nDP World Ltd signed a 250-billion-rupee (US$3.02-billion) contract in January to upgrade port infrastructure in Gujarat, including deep-draft ports, a special economic zone, and a private freight station. An India Mart facility in the UAE that Indian officials say will be ready by year's end would allow 40,000 Indian firms to pre-position goods. And a 1,506-kilometre (936-mile) rail line connecting northern India to ports in western India, part of which is already operational, is expected to keep goods flowing from production hubs to ports.\nTo be sure, the IMEC project has not garnered support from all countries that it affects. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, for one, has said it cannot exist without his sign-off, which he has withheld.&nbsp;&nbsp;\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron also is seeking to host a first meeting to lay the groundwork of IMEC, his special envoy for the project, Gerard Mestrallet, told Bloomberg.\nBut that proposal has been privately questioned by other countries on the grounds that France did not have a primary role ahead of the IMEC announcement, according to officials from two countries that are party to the agreement and who declined to be identified discussing the topic publicly.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhich app or platform do you usually use to book accommodations?\nBooking.com\nAgoda\nAirbnb\nTrip.com\nTraveloka\nExpedia\nSkyscanner\nDirectly with the accommodation\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nTrade\nAsia\nEurope\nEu\nUnited states\nDo you like the content of this article?\n3\n5\nCOMMENT\n(1)",

        "content": "Thailand\nPR News\nIndonesia\u2019s Economic Vision: A Global Force by 2045\nPUBLISHED : 26 Feb 2024 at 12:01\n&nbsp; Small\n&nbsp; Medium\n&nbsp; Large\nPermataBank CEO Ibu Meliza Rusli outlines Indonesia\u2019s growth drivers and pivotal global trade role, emphasising digitalisation and sustainability.\nIn an insightful conversation with the Bangkok Post, Meliza Rusli, President Director of PermataBank, highlights the key drivers poised to propel Indonesia into a leading global and regional trading power by 2045, including the nation\u2019s vibrant startup ecosystem, burgeoning middle class, and strategic investments in sectors like digitalisation and renewable energy. In so doing, she sheds light on Indonesia\u2019s ambitious journey towards becoming the 4th largest economy in the world.\nWhat are the key drivers of Indonesia\u2019s economy moving forward and what role do you see the country playing in global and regional trade?\nWe believe Indonesia will play an increasingly important role in both trade within Southeast Asia and with the region\u2019s key trading partners. We are Southeast Asia\u2019s largest economy with a clear vision to become the 4th largest single economy in the world within 2045, driven by factors such as positive demographics, a growing middle class, a vibrant startup scene and abundant natural resources. This puts us on a path to deliver consistent future growth and to offer great potential in the digitalisation, renewable energy, healthcare, supply chain and manufacturing sectors. New growth areas, such as electric vehicle (EV) production provide fertile ground for investment. These are some of the factors that led Bangkok Bank to acquire PermataBank in 2020, which was the largest intra-ASEAN banking acquisition in history. We celebrate the fourth anniversary of our acquisition in the coming May.\nOur economy proved itself to be robust and resilient throughout the coronavirus pandemic, recovering faster than average compared to other countries. This helps create confidence in our position as a reliable, major producer of raw materials for other industries within the ASEAN region and beyond. Going forward, the development and economic integration of the greater Asian region, spanning from China and Japan, through ASEAN countries to Indonesia, will be a driving force for the economies of Southeast Asian nations. We are well placed to support development programmes such as the Belt and Road Initiative and the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity.\nRELATED\nthailand\nWarmest congratulations to INDONESIA on her Independence Day\nbusiness\nThai banks stay the course\nThe region\u2019s economic growth prospects remain relatively high, coupled with strong regional stability, making it attractive for investors. Moreover, with the trend of diversifying manufacturing value chains in addition to China, ASEAN countries are emerging as potential destinations for investors, offering relatively high growth, cost-effective production, and labour, and a consistently growing market.\nHow important is ASEAN to Indonesia\u2019s growth?\nASEAN plays a highly significant role in our economy, both as a trade partner and a source of foreign direct investment. ASEAN is Indonesia\u2019s second-largest trading partner after China, accounting for 21% of our total trade value in 2022. Trade between Indonesia and ASEAN is on an upward trend and reached US$111.4 billion in 2022.\nBy being part of ASEAN, Indonesia gains broader market access for our products, and similarly, ASEAN countries can market their products in Indonesia. With the increasingly integrated global manufacturing production chains, Indonesia and ASEAN countries can collaborate to enhance their roles in the global manufacturing production chain, which is already evident in the automotive industry.\nA key driver of our ability to support such developments is Bangkok Bank Group\u2019s Connecting ASEAN strategy, which focuses on building the partnerships and facilitating the trade and investment needed to deliver sustainable growth across the region. Bangkok Bank has been building its regional and international network since 1954 and this enables us to tap into unparalleled expertise, experience, and advice on how to help businesses invest and grow across the region.\nWe are working to help customers understand the importance of having a regionalisation strategy. Currently, most Indonesian companies are focused on our domestic market because it offers so much growth potential, a key factor in attracting investment from other ASEAN markets such as Thailand. However, we believe those local companies that develop a regionalisation strategy now will gain significant long-term advantages over those who decide to wait longer.\nConnecting ASEAN goes beyond trade and investment to facilitating regional financial connectivity, interoperability, and cross border payment. We have worked with Bangkok Bank to achieve good successes through the use of QR code cross-border payment as well as trade finance.\nWhat are you seeing in terms of trade and investment between Thailand and Indonesia?\nDirect investment and trade value from Thailand into Indonesia has been steadily increasing over the past 20 years. Foreign direct investment (FDI) from Thailand to Indonesia has grown from $16 million in 2003 to $186 million in 2023. Moreover, total trade value between Thailand and Indonesia also rose significantly, from $3.1 billion in 2003 to $19.2 billion in 2022.\nPermataBank, Indonesia\u2019s 8th largest bank by assets, can support companies wanting to invest or expand into Indonesia by providing a full range of corporate banking services. We can also support the investors\u2019 and their employees\u2019 deposit and wealth banking needs served through our digital platform and 216 domestic branches.\nWe are also concentrating on facilitating business matching to help PermataBank and Bangkok Bank customers find the right partner to expand their endeavours. At the same time, we are striving to provide cross-selling synergy to both banks\u2019 customers and accelerate cross-border trade through the support of ASEAN member governments.\nWe are also working with Bangkok Bank Group customers in Thailand. Recently PermataBank collaborated with The Mall Group in Thailand to deliver real value to PermataBank credit card customers who can access discounts and special prices when using their PermataBank cards at The Mall Group outlets in Thailand.\nHow are Indonesia\u2019s government, regulators and businesses doing in terms of adopting ESG and transitioning to net zero? What are the key challenges they are facing?\nIndonesia is taking sustainability very seriously. We have a diverse ecosystem, abundant natural resources, and a fast-growing population, so it is critical that we develop sustainably to safeguard the future for generations to come.\nPresident Jokowi\u2019s government committed to achieving net zero within 2060. To support this, the Financial Services Authority (OJK) developed the Sustainable Finance Roadmap 2021-2025 and published the Green Taxonomy in 2022. These initiatives help provide a regulatory ESG framework for finance which can help attract both domestic and foreign investment to help the country to achieve its sustainability objectives.\nThis relatively new focus on sustainability and sustainable finance has been received positively in Indonesia. More green financing products such as green bonds, sustainability bonds, sustainability-linked loans, social impact bonds, and SME loans, as well as sustainable investment funds, are being developed. There\u2019s also increasing focus on the social aspect of ESG in terms of expanding financial inclusion to unbanked and underbanked people.\nWhile Indonesia has started its sustainability journey, we know we will face challenges along the way. We are the world\u2019s fourth-largest emitter of greenhouse gases and Southeast Asia relies on fossil fuels for about 80% of the region\u2019s energy production. It is important that we help facilitate a just transition which balances the demand for an affordable, reliable supply of electricity to households with the pace of decarbonisation.\nInitiatives, such as Indonesia\u2019s Just Energy Transition Partnership, are already in place to mitigate such challenges. The partnership will mobilise $20 billion in public and private financing to decarbonise Indonesia\u2019s energy sector through decarbonisation of coal power plants, expanding renewable energy capacity and infrastructure, and developing a green ecosystem. While this is a good start, it falls well short of the investment that will be required.\nTransition requires funds and innovation, and this will also lead to new opportunities for investment and job creation in the sustainability space, such as green infrastructure, electric vehicles, environmentally friendly transportation, renewable energy, waste management, sustainable buildings, and sustainable tourism.\nAs part of Bangkok Bank Group, PermataBank is able to draw on the group\u2019s experience and expertise both in terms of providing transition finance as well as advising corporate customers on how they can seek new opportunities in the sustainability space, identify and manage ESG-related risks and adapt their business models to comply with increasingly stringent ESG regulations. Bangkok Bank is a leading financier of green/renewable energy and transition finance in ASEAN as well as the leading underwriter of green and ESG bonds in Thailand.\nWhat impact do you think the recent elections will have on Indonesia\u2019s economic strategy and direction?\n(This interview was conducted before the official result of the election was announced)\nThe official results will be released by 20 March, so we do not have confirmation of the winner yet. We are the world\u2019s third largest democracy with more than 200 million eligible voters and the elections for more than 20,000 seats across more than 17,000 islands were conducted in a free and fair way. Whoever is officially declared the winner, we expect key economic and sustainability policies and commitments to remain largely intact. While the different presidential candidates proposed different policies, in terms of the business and economic environment, we expect continuity in the approach to creating a transparent and welcoming investment environment. We are all committed to helping Indonesia grow in an equitable and sustainable manner.\nwww.permatabank.com\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nHow much do hotel reviews (e.g., TripAdvisor, Google Reviews) influence your accommodation choice?\nVery important, I always check reviews before booking\nSomewhat important, I check reviews if I\u2019m unsure\nNeutral, I don\u2019t pay much attention to reviews\nNot important at all, I don\u2019t check reviews\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nPermataBank\nDo you like the content of this article?\n3\n0",

(Supplied photo)\nThe government has vowed to go ahead with the 1-trillion-baht Land Bridge megaproject after the House of Representatives endorsed a feasibility study on the project last week.\nThe study was conducted by a special House committee.\nThe scheme is high on the Pheu Thai-led government's agenda. It is among the major investment schemes the government is trying to promote among potential foreign investors.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThose who support the Land Bridge project said it would help improve the economy, but those against the project are concerned about its environmental impact and financial costs.\nRELATED\nproperty\nCPN allots B1bn to enlarge Phuket mall\nbusiness\nFinance Minister Pichai sees B3tn for stimulus funds\nSome people want the government to conduct a well-rounded survey on the project to lessen the environmental and livelihood impacts.\nPrime Minister Srettha Thavisin has said previously the government is trying to create a climate fitting for foreign investment as it plans roadshows overseas to draw more attention from foreign investors.\nThe Land Bridge is the country's largest investment project in 20 years after the construction of Suvarnabhumi airport, he said.\nThe 1-trillion-baht megaproject aims to develop a logistics network connecting Ranong along the Andaman Sea to Chumphon along the Gulf of Thailand.\nThe project comprises deep-water ports in both provinces, a motorway cutting across the land to connect the two provinces and a railway system.\nTouted benefits\nThe study suggested investment for the project should be carried out under a public private partnership (PPP) model, allowing the private sector to invest in the construction and management of the project for 50 years.\nAccording to the study, Thailand's geographical position makes the country an ideal site for the project as the country serves as a gateway for transport and trade in the region as well as links with other continents.\nThe Land Bridge project will become a new logistics and transport hub as well as a new route for shipping, serving as an alternative to the existing route for the shipment of goods from the Indian Ocean to the Pacific Ocean through the Strait of Malacca.\nIt will help cut travel time from nine days through the Strait of Malacca to five days, reducing costs, according to the study.\nThe project's net present value (NPV) is estimated at more than 257 billion baht and the project's payback period is 24 years, according to the study. The payback period is the length of time an investor needs to recover an investment or reach a breakeven point.\nThe project is expected to create 130,000 jobs in Ranong, 150,000 jobs in Chumphon and to increase GDP from an earlier estimate of 4% per year by the National Economic and Social Development Council, to 5.5%, according to the study.\nIt forms part of the development of the Southern Economic Corridor, which comprises parts of Chumphon, Ranong, Surat Thani and Nakhon Si Thammarat provinces, the study said.\nThe study also suggested that since the Land Bridge is such a massive investment project, a special law is need for its implementation, as in the case of the Eastern Economic Corridor (EEC) project, while an environmental impact assessment is also required.\nThe study noted the private sector still expresses concern about the impact of the project on communities as a result of land expropriation.\nThe private sector suggested the government should offer appropriate compensation to ease the plight of people affected by the project and also upskill local labourers to prepare for the Southern Economic Corridor and the Land Bridge project, as well as plans to protect the environment and natural resources.\n\"It is necessary for the government to provide locals with clear information and allow them a say in the project,'' the study suggested.\nTransport Minister Suriya Juangruangreangkit said the Land Bridge project is part of the Southern Economic Corridor which will boost logistics, connectivity and trade with member countries of the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation -- Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Myanmar, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Thailand.\n\"Several countries are keeping an eye on how Thailand will carry out the Land Bridge project while some countries have expressd interest in investing,\" he said.\n\"The project will benefit from Thailand's geopolitical advantage as the country is located between the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean, with sea routes on both sides. Apart from benefits in terms of transport, investments in related industries will take place in local areas,\" Mr Suriya said.\nSuriya: Set to boost logistics and trade\nMFP's objections\nHowever, Deputy Move Forward Party leader and list MP Sirikanya Tansakun has raised objections to the project.\nShe was among four MFP MPs who quit the House committee studying the megaproject. They said they do not want to rubber-stamp a project they disagree with.\nShe said she quit because it accepted the content of a report prepared by the Office of Transport and Traffic Policy and Planning (OTP) without thorough scrutiny.\nMs Sirikanya said they had repeatedly asked the OTP to clarify the project's cost-effectiveness, the type of ships that would use the services provided by the project, and the volume of goods expected to go through ports.\nHowever, the OTP did not give a reply, she said, adding the study by the House committee was based on the OTP's report. She insisted the MFP agrees with the government's southern economic development plan, but officials must quell all doubts before concluding whether investing in the project is worth it or not.\n\"I am not attempting to obstruct development in the South. But I am ready to support the project if the report from the OTP and the House committee's study is revised or a new study is conducted to ensure cost-effectiveness,\" she said.\nSirikanya: Questions cost-effectiveness\nThirarat Samretwanich, a Pheu Thai MP for Bangkok and spokeswoman for the special House committee studying the project, said the study has been sent back to the cabinet after the House of Representatives endorsed it.\nThe cabinet will now act on the recommendations provided in the study and find ways to address any concerns raised before resubmitting it to parliament, she said.\nResponding to criticism on the project's cost-effectiveness, Ms Thirarat said the Land Bridge project requires an investment of about 1 trillion baht, and it will come entirely from the private sector. She said it is up to potential investors to consider whether the project is worth investing in.\n\"If they find that using the&nbsp;shipping route will save their costs, they will decide to invest. They can decide on the cost-effectiveness themselves,\" she said, adding that bidding for the project is expected next year.\nThirarat: Study sent back to cabinet\nWeighing impacts\nAssoc Prof Somjai Phagaphasvivat, an independent political and economic analyst, told the Bangkok Post the Pheu Thai-led government is determined to push for the project alongside the ruling party's digital wallet scheme.\nHowever, he said the Land Bridge megaproject requires a substantial sum of money, will take a long time to materialise and it must be undertaken in phases.\n\"The project may take at least 10 years before it can materialise as it involves attracting investors, analysing the budget, infrastructure and utilities,\" he said. \"The project will also connect with the Greater Mekong Subregion, Europe, and China's Belt and Road Initiative,\" Assoc Prof Somjai said.\nHowever, the project's potential impact on fiscal stability, society and the environment must be weighed before implementation, he said. He said the government must also convince investors that the project will help cut shipping time and costs. How the government handles the land expropriation issue and rivalry with Singapore's port will also come into play.\n\"This project is tough because it requires a huge sum of money. But the public debt-to-GDP ratio is about 61% now and investment expenditure accounts for only 20% of the annual expenditure budget.\nEconomic growth remains sluggish while the country's competitiveness is low,\" he said.\n\"It depends on the government's ability to convince investors,\" he said, adding the Land Bridge project could become a potential geopolitical flashpoint as competing powers vie for influence in the region.\nSomjai: Requires a huge sum of money\nJiraroth Sukolrat, deputy director of the OTP, said work on the required environmental impact assessment (EIA), construction design and business development model are expected to be completed in September. They will then be presented for cabinet approval in July or August of next year.\nBidding will be open by the middle of 2025 and the first phase of construction will begin in September of 2025 and could be complete in September 2030, he said, adding that as investment will come entirely from the private sector, the government will only deal with land expropriation.\nJiraroth: EIA to be done by September\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat is your budget range for purchasing a condominium?\nEkkamai-Thong Lor\nSathorn-Silom\nChidlom-Siam\nBang Na\nChinatown\nAri\nRiverside\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nLand bridge\nSouth\nProject\nBaht\nTrillion\nDo you like the content of this article?\n7\n163\nCOMMENT\n(49)",

While the country has made significant progress in socio-economic development in recent years, food insecurity is still an ongoing and serious issue amid global and regional food supply and price fluctuations. According to a recent United Nations report, about 2.5 million Cambodians -- around 15% of the population -- experience severe food insecurity.\nRELATED\nworld\nUS warship makes rare visit to&nbsp;Cambodia&nbsp;base at centre of feud\nthailand\nSEA-TEP Model: Shaping the Future of Teacher Education\nWith a population of around 16.5 million people, nearly 80% of which live in rural areas. Agriculture plays a key role in the country's economy. Cambodia's population relies heavily on agriculture and fisheries, which employs up to 49% of the country's labour force and accounts for 22% of the country's gross domestic product (GDP). Sixty-five percent of Cambodians rely on agriculture, fisheries, and forestry for their livelihoods.\nAgriculture remains largely dominated by rice (70%), the country's most important export commodity and major crop. This is followed by subsidiary and industrial crops (such as sugar cane) (20%), rubber plantations (7%), and permanent crops (such as cashew) (4%), rendering the country reliant on rice.\nHowever, its leading markets are varied, demonstrating the country's interest and willingness to pursue a diversification strategy. In 2023, Cambodia exported nearly 8.45 million tonnes of agricultural products (US$4.3 billion, or about 155.2 billion baht) to about 75 countries and regions, with China, Vietnam, and Thailand among the main markets.\nAlthough agriculture could be a strong driver of socio-economic growth and food security in Cambodia, a number of concerns must first be addressed.\nThe rise of climate-related disasters (such as severe droughts) is notably severe too. Cambodia also faces high disaster risks from flood and drought due in part to high levels of exposure and vulnerability and a low adaptive capacity. Cambodia's 4.5 million hectares of cultivated land is mainly rainfed, making it reliant on the weather and precipitation. Thus, the agriculture sector is particularly vulnerable to climate-related disasters. Increased temperatures, increasingly unpredictable weather, and shifting precipitation patterns alongside extensive damming for hydropower throughout the Mekong Basin, could impact food security and human health through reduced freshwater availability, declines in agricultural and fishery production, and increases in water-borne diseases.\nRural families, especially small-scale farmers -- who make up 75 percent of the country's 6.8 million farmers, are among the most vulnerable, given their dependence on agriculture for their livelihood.\nTo address these interlinked issues, the government and policymakers may encourage crop diversification to reduce reliance on rice, such as the cultivation of more less water-consuming resilient and climate-resistant crop varieties alongside the irrigation of land.\nEarly warning systems for weather forecasting and climate monitoring could also be implemented to help farmers take preventive measures or adjust their farming practices accordingly. Australia, which has significant experience in areas such as agricultural technologies, disaster risk management and monitoring, and climate change adaptation, can help.\nWater resources must be managed better, too. As the country experiences seasonal water scarcity and has limited potential for water harvesting and storage facilities to improve water availability due to relatively flat topography, Cambodia could look to countries like Australia where improved water use efficiency in the agricultural sector (such as through drip irrigation systems) has helped reduce water stress concerns. In recent decades, water-use productivity by Australian cotton growers has improved by 40% due to yield increases and more efficient water-management systems.\nIn addition to improving the country's production and post-harvest infrastructure, as well as transport and logistic infrastructure to strengthen agri-food value chains, access to finance and knowledge should also be improved alongside increased access to agricultural inputs and machinery for increasing labour productivity.\nCambodia's lack of further processing technology for the production of higher value-added products is another concern. Due to the limited processing capacity of Cambodian agricultural products, the majority of the country's exported goods are primary products. In response, policymakers could improve the processing capacity of Cambodian agricultural products through infrastructure, financing, and research and development (R&amp;D) for processing and product development.\nForeign direct investment (FDI) opportunities in Cambodia's agricultural sector should not be ignored either. The commercialisation and development of processing industries, for instance, could offer such opportunities. A meeting between the chairman of Asian agribusiness Wilmar International and the Cambodian prime minister earlier this year shows that there is interest in doing so.\nA growing number of countries in the region are also interested in greater agricultural and food cooperation with Cambodia. Aside from Australia, one of the country's long-standing strategic partners and major agricultural development partners, inter-regional investment remains possible. In September last year, Memorandums of Understanding on agricultural cooperation and small business development were signed by Southeast Asian states as part of broader efforts to push the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) towards stronger economic integration.\nOther countries are interested, too. For instance, Indonesia, Cambodia's sixth-largest trading partner, is eyeing potential investments in Cambodia's rice bowl. In November 2023, the first shipment of Cambodian rice reached Indonesia.\nThailand, also Cambodia's second-largest trade partner in ASEAN, aims to reach US$15 billion in bilateral trade, including agricultural trade, by 2025.\nElsewhere, import-reliant Japan remains interested in Cambodian agricultural exports, while South Korea has announced it will continue to implement joint agricultural projects with Cambodia.\nCambodia's biggest trading partner, China, is interested in agricultural investment and food security cooperation with Cambodia, a Belt and Road Initiative country. Outside of participating in the new Asean-China food security agreement, the two countries seek stronger bilateral agricultural cooperation, as recent agreements to establish a \"Fish and Rice Corridor\" and a Sino-Cambodian \"Industrial Development Corridor\" demonstrate.\nOutside of Asia, both France and Israel have expressed interest in agricultural cooperation.\nCambodia's greater emphasis on local agricultural production and grand ambition of becoming one of the world's biggest agricultural producers face numerous domestic challenges.\nWhile it is clear that the government and policymakers will face a tough battle in addressing these concerns, opportunities for international, regional, inter-regional, and bilateral agricultural and food security cooperation with the country remain.\nGenevieve Donnellon-May is a research associate at the Asia Society Policy Institute and the Asia Society Australia.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat is your budget range for purchasing a house in Thailand?\nUnder 3 million THB\n3 million - 5 million THB\n5 million - 8 million THB\n8 million - 12 million THB\nOver 12 million THB\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nCambodia\nAgriculture\nDo you like the content of this article?\n65\n5\nCOMMENT\n(4)",

But the absence of pandas does not truly mirror our close diplomatic relations with China over the past 50 years,\" he said after meeting with the Chinese minister at Government House in Bangkok.\nChiang Mai Zoo previously hosted two giant pandas, which became immediate stars after their arrival in 2003 as goodwill ambassadors.

Construction of the section in Thailand - seen by some as a \"fiscal trap\" - has been delayed in recent years for reasons ranging from cost-sharing to Covid-19.\nThailand and China must promote the early implementation of the China-Laos-Thailand connectivity concept, the Chinese Foreign Ministry cited Mr Wang as telling the prime minister.\nAccording to Thailand, construction of the first phase from Bangkok to Nakhon Ratchasima is over 15% complete, and should be operational by 2027. The second leg should be ready by 2028.\nThe Thailand section was delayed in 2016 when Bangkok rejected Chinese financing due to what it said were high interest rates.\nIt later agreed to shoulder the entire construction cost of 179 billion baht for the 252-km first phase, with China responsible for installing systems, design, and procurement of trains.\nThe second phase is to connect Nakhon Ratchasima to Nong Khai.\nThe outlook for the section connecting Bangkok with Malaysia and Singapore remains unclear after Kuala Lumpur halted the plan previously.\nThe Chinese minister sent the same message on Sunday, saying after meeting with Foreign Minister Parnpree Bahiddha-Nukara that the two countries should make progress on the rail project, which is under the Belt and Road Initiative, according to Xinhua.\nThailand and Laos agreed to\nextend railroad services\n&nbsp;from Thanaleng, the Lao border town opposite Nong Khai, to Khamsavath, a new station in southern Vientiane.\nThen-prime minister Prayut Chan-o-cha and the Chinese presient agreed last year to celebrate the&nbsp;golden jubilee of diplomatic ties with numerous activities next year.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat type of condominium are you most interested in?\nStudio\n1-bedroom\n2-bedroom\n3-bedroom\nPenthouse\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nDo you like the content of this article?\n7\n41\nCOMMENT\n(19)",

Many shipping routes may change, possibly switching to rely on the Belt and Road Initiative that utilises rail transport. In addition, the use of fuel for transport may decrease, shifting towards alternative energy sources such as electric vehicles,\" said Mr Chaichan.\n\"In terms of export markets, again it is unpredictable as Thailand's main markets may change. In the future, our key market may not be China. Everything is subject to rapid and unpredictable changes, and no one knows anything for certain.\"\nHe said if the government reduces the project size by considering global demand and develops a comprehensive development direction for the Southern Economic Corridor before building infrastructure, it would significantly reduce the investment required, increasing the chances of success for the project.\n\"Long-term investment stimulation is essential, but it must be in projects that align with the country's needs and direction. The government needs to identify the types of industries the country wants to support and potential buyers, as well as carefully evaluate the project's viability and worthiness,\" Mr Chaichan said.\n\"It is crucial that the business sector have confidence in the project's ability to generate profits or reduce its operational costs. Projects should also benefit surrounding communities, hiring and improving the skills of the local workforce to create long-term employment opportunities.\"\nMost importantly, he said the project should be developed sustainably, promoting environmentally friendly industries, supporting health tourism, and adding value to agricultural products in the project areas.\nALTERNATIVE ROUTE\nThe Land Bridge project is considered the government's largest scheme to drive the country's economy.\nAn economic development strategist who requested anonymity said dating back to the Ayutthaya period, the old capital city was equidistant between India and China, becoming a regional trade centre and an important connecting point between the two.\nGoods coming from Persia or India were routed via Dawei, then transported through Ranong and Ayutthaya.\nIn the colonial era, Myanmar and Singapore were colonised by the British, reshaping  regional trade routes through the Malacca  Strait, which has been an important maritime trade route between India and China  since then.\nThe Land Bridge project proposes to connect the Andaman Sea to the Gulf of Thailand via Ranong and Chumphon provinces as a transit hub.\nThe project involves building two deep-sea ports and 90 kilometres of road and rail lines to facilitate cargo transport between Chumphon on the eastern coast along the Gulf of Thailand to Ranong on the western coast along the Andaman Sea.\nThe project would become a new logistics and transport hub, as well as a new route for shipping, serving  as an alternative to the existing route between the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean.\nThe main selling point of the scheme is it would cut travel time from nine days to five days, thus reducing shipping expenses.\nThe initial concept involves building a transport route for goods from the Eastern Economic Corridor (EEC) at Laem Chabang port to the Andaman Coast for around 8 million tonnes annually.\nThe project would also serve as a development model for the Southern Economic Corridor.\nEconomists predict China would benefit the most from this project.\nThe bulk of freight traffic from China to Europe goes through the congested Malacca Strait between Malaysia, Indonesia and Singapore.\nSome strategists have proposed a second alternative of a cargo rail line that connects from Asia all the way to Europe.\nThe investment estimate for the project is 1 trillion baht, expected via a PPP where the private sector is the investor for the entire project.\nThis colossal undertaking would be executed in four phases, with the first estimated at 610 billion baht, the second 165 billion, the third 229 billion and the fourth 85.1 billion.\nRAISING COMPETITIVENESS\nSomjai Phagaphasvivat, an independent political and economic analyst, said in terms of economic rationality, the proposed 1-trillion-baht land bridge project is considered economically feasible and would help improve the country's competitiveness.\nMr Somjai said the project would allow other countries to use Thailand as a transport centre.\nThailand has lost competitiveness over the past two decades as the country's GDP expanded by only 2.6% on average, compared with 4.3% for Southeast Asia, he said.\nThe government needs to secure concrete investment to prevent a spike in public debt, said Mr Somjai.\nIncreasing income for the country through promoting tourism and soft power, stimulating exports, or attracting foreign direct investment will help strengthen the government's fiscal stability, he said.\nHowever, the project's potential impact on fiscal stability, society and the environment must be weighed before implementation, said Mr Somjai.\nThe public debt-to-GDP ratio is 62% now and investment expenditure accounts for only 20% of the annual expenditure budget.\nIf the project is unsuccessful, it will have an impact on the government's fiscal burden, he said.\nThere are also several uncontrollable external factors to consider that could affect the economy, such another potential pandemic or a war on the scale of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, said Mr Somjai.\nIn addition, he said the Land Bridge project has the potential to become a geopolitical flashpoint as competing powers vie for influence in the region, though Mr Srettha appears keen to sidestep such tensions by welcoming all investors.\nPrime Minister Srettha Thavisin at Laem Son National Park in tambon Muang Kluang of Ranong's Kapoe district on January 22, 2024 to inspect a construction site for the Land Bridge megaproject.\nFACTORS FOR SUCCESS\nKevalin Wangpichayasuk, deputy managing director of Kasikorn Research Center, said the proposed Land  Bridge is similar to the defunct Dawei project in that they are both massive in terms of investment and the host governments are trying to entice foreign financing.\nShe said the Dawei project failed for two reasons: political changes in Myanmar and the developer, which was a Thai company, had financial problems that hampered project development.\n\"I think the Thai government has greater capability than Myanmar to disburse budget and mobilise funding to support this project,\" Ms Kevalin told the Bangkok Post.\n\"It depends on finding the right investors and how much potential they see in this project.\"\nGiven the estimated cost of 1 trillion baht, the government should evaluate recent changes in geopolitics to ensure there is sufficient demand for shipments through this region to justify the Land Bridge, she said.\nConflicts between the US and China as well as Russia and Europe are leading to changes in global supply chain, said Ms Kevalin.\nGlobal companies and foreign investors have started to shift their investments to destinations such as India, Mexico and eastern Europe.\n\"As a result, there might be less demand for goods shipment via the regions the Land Bridge aims to serve,\" she said.\n\"With this level of investment, we need to ensure the project is worthwhile.\"\nIn addition, Ms Kevalin said the opinions of residents in the project area should be considered, comprising the provinces of Ranong, Chumphon, Surat Thani and Nakhon Si Thammarat.\nLocals should be consulted while drafting this project, and products and services from the region should be promoted, she said.\nThe Land Bridge should start as a special economic zone, similar to the Eastern Seaboard project before it expanded to the EEC, said Ms Kevalin.\nSingapore and Malaysia both have ports and similar projects under development, she said.\n\"We should not view the neighbouring projects as competitors, but rather as complements, benefiting the Southeast Asian region,\" said Ms Kevalin.\nNEW FACE OF THE SOUTH\nIf the government manages to develop the Land Bridge scheme, parts of the southern region will be moulded similarly to the Eastern Seaboard, becoming a new economic engine for the country, said Kriengkrai Thiennukul, chairman of the Federation of Thai Industries (FTI).\nHe said he believes the Land Bridge will play an important role in boosting foreign direct investment in the long term.\nInvestors from the Middle East and China are rumoured to be interested in the project, according to media reports, which can lead to the development of many industries such as oil refining and petrochemical manufacturing, said Mr Kriengkrai.\nMr Srettha said earlier Dubai Ports World, a multinational logistics company, expressed interest in investing in the megaproject.\n\"The Land Bridge will pave the way for the South to develop like the Eastern Seaboard,\" said Mr Kriengkrai.\nThe Eastern Seaboard scheme, which covers parts of Chon Buri, Rayong and Chachoengsao provinces, started in 1982 when the government wanted to develop deep-sea ports, industrial estates and facilities to support gas discovery in the Gulf of Thailand.\nWith the birth of new industries based on high technology, authorities added infrastructure to the seaboard and developed it into the EEC, which is expected to become the country's high-tech industrial hub.\nThe Land Bridge is expected to serve as a gateway linking goods shipping from Laem Chabang port, located in Chon Buri, with countries in the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation, as well as other nations.\n\"The Land Bridge is similar to the EEC, but the former is a long-term investment project with higher investment value than the latter,\" said Mr Kriengkrai.\n\"This does not mean the government has to make the whole investment by itself. It needs to partner with groups of investors.\"\nHe said he is confident the Land Bridge project has the potential to draw foreign investment.\nThe Land Bridge project is intended to connect the Andaman Sea and the Gulf of Thailand via Ranong and Chumphon provinces as a transit hub.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat factor most influences your decision to choose a hotel or resort?\nPrice and discounts\nHotel reviews and ratings\nProximity to attractions\nHotel loyalty programs (e.g., points, rewards)\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nLand bridge\nSouth\nProject\nBaht\nTrillion\nRisks\nDo you like the content of this article?\n7\n123\nCOMMENT\n(48)",

(Photo: Reuters)\nCHANCAY, Peru - In September, a group of Brazilian farmers and officials arrived in the Peruvian fishing town of Chancay. The draw: a new Chinese mega-port rising on the Pacific coast, promising to turbocharge South America\u2019s trade ties with China.\nThe $3.5-billion deepwater port, set to start operations late this year, will provide China with a direct gateway to the resource-rich region. Over the last 10 years, Beijing has unseated the United States as the largest trade partner for South America, devouring its soybeans, corn and copper.\nThe port, majority-owned by Chinese state-owned firm Cosco Shipping, will be the first controlled by China in South America. It will able to accommodate the largest cargo ships, which can head directly to Asia, cutting the journey time by two weeks for some exporters.\nADVERTISEMENT\nBeijing and Lima hope Chancay will become a regional hub, both for copper exports from the Andean nation as well as soy from western Brazil, which currently travels through the Panama Canal or skirts the Atlantic before steaming to China.\n\u201cThe Chancay mega-port aims to turn Peru into a strategic commercial and port hub between South America and Asia,\u201d Peru Trade Minister Juan Mathews Salazar told Reuters.\nRELATED\nworld\nLaos-China railway boosts trade and tourism, but also Beijing's clout\nlife\nA cultural gem in Macau\nPart of China\u2019s decade-old Belt and Road drive, the port embodies the challenge facing the United States and Europe as they look to counter Beijing\u2019s rising influence in Latin America. China\u2019s trade muscle has helped it win allies and gain leverage in political forums, finance and technology.\nFull construction started in 2018 at Chancay, some 80 kilometres north of Lima. Workers are now laying thousands of piles and breakwaters; work signs are written in white-on-red Chinese characters.\nThe first phase of Chancay is set be completed in November 2024. President Xi Jinping, expected in Peru for an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) summit that month, could inaugurate the port, a diplomatic source in Lima said.\nChina\u2019s embassy in Lima did not respond to Reuters queries.\n\u201cIt\u2019s part of China\u2019s new Silk Road,\u201d said Mario de las Casas, corporate affairs manager for Cosco Shipping, which holds a 60% stake in the port. The remainder is controlled by local miner Volcan, in which Glencore owns a stake.\nJose Adriano da Silva, a farming entrepreneur from Brazil\u2019s western Acre state who visited the port, said the project would accelerate regional development. He said talks between Peruvian and Brazilian officials were under way to resolve overland transport challenges.\nPeru\u2019s government is planning an exclusive economic zone near the port and Cosco wants to build an industrial hub near Chancay to process raw materials that could include grains and meat from Brazil before shipping them to Asia.\nBrazil\u2019s ambassador in Peru, Clemente Baena Soares, said there were plans for meetings between officials early this year to seek to resolve logistical, sanitary and bureaucratic hurdles at the border so Brazilian trucks can more easily reach the port.\n\u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity for grain and meat production \u2014 especially from Rondonia, Acre, Mato Grosso and Amazonas \u2014 to go to Asia through the port of Chancay,\u201d said Soares, who also visited Chancay in September, naming four states in western Brazil.\n\u201c(Brazilian businesses) are delighted with the possibility of not using the Panama Canal to take their goods to Asia.\u201d\nHe added there would need to be investment in an existing road known as the Interoceanic Highway \u2014 which runs from further south in Peru across the Andes to Brazil \u2014 to improve transport routes.

Under President Joe Biden the gap has widened despite attempts to reverse it.\nUS officials are now taking a different tack, arguing that the United States offers the region other things beyond trade, including investment in high-tech industries.\n\u201cI think using the metric of trade to evaluate the influence of China is not an accurate way,\u201d Juan Gonzalez, a White House adviser and the National Security Council\u2019s Western Hemisphere senior director, told Reuters in Buenos Aires.\n\u201cWe\u2019re confident in our ability to compete with China,\u201d he added, urging regional governments to ensure there were no \u201cpolitical strings attached\u201d to trade with Beijing.\nBeijing says its trade and investment in Latin America is a win-win for both sides. Some 150 countries have signed on to the Belt and Road with China, including 22 in Latin America.\nThe change over 10 years is stark.\nA decade ago, Peru, the world\u2019s second-largest copper producer, traded slightly more with the United States than China. Now, China has a more than $10-billion lead in bilateral trade, the latest annual data show.\nThat trend is playing out around the region.\nReuters interviewed two dozen officials, business leaders and trade experts, along with an analysis of ten years of trade data, revealing how China\u2019s infrastructure spending is cementing its role as the key trade and investment partner for South America, defying an economic slowdown at home and US warnings about \u201cdebt trap diplomacy\u201d.\nPart of the shift is pragmatic. Fast-growing China needs the copper and lithium from South America\u2019s Andes, along with the corn and soy from the plains of Argentina and Brazil.\nBut its widening trade lead \u2014 some $100 billion around South America in the most recent annual data \u2014 brings extra clout.\nBeijing has in the last year upgraded ties with Uruguay and Colombia to \u201cstrategic partnerships\u201d \u2014 the latter a US ally.\nArgentina\u2019s President Javier Milei, once highly critical of China, has softened his stance since taking office last month, reflecting Beijing\u2019s importance to the crisis-hit economy.\nIt is the top buyer of Argentina\u2019s soy and beef and has an $18 billion currency swap line with the country \u2014 which Argentina\u2019s cash-strapped government has tapped to pay its debt, including with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).\n\u201cThe last thing our dear Argentine friends need in these challenging times is to lose the support of an important partner like China,\u201d the Chinese ambassador in Colombia wrote on social media platform X following Milei\u2019s inauguration. (Story continues below)\nA woman stands next to an information board at the construction site of the port in Chancay, Peru. (Photo: Reuters)\n\u2018Point of leverage\u2019\nPeru\u2019s trade with China doubled in the last decade to $33 billion in 2022, driven by rising copper exports, even as its commerce flatlined with the United States. China has invested some $24 billion in Peruvian mines, the power grid, transport and hydro-electric power generation over the same period.\nExports to China grew 9.3% in the first eleven months of last year, government data show, faster than the 5.3% growth of exports to the United States. Peru has a $9.4 billion trade surplus with China and a $1.3 billion deficit the United States.\nPeru\u2019s President Dina Boluarte met China\u2019s Xi in November at the Apec forum in San Francisco. They discussed the Chancay port, which Boluarte said was a \u201csignificant boost to free trade and new Chinese investments.\u201d\nThat came after an awkward on-the-move parlay in Washington with Biden, which was not given full bilateral meeting status.\n\u201cChina is taking advantage of our absence and that\u2019s a real problem,\u201d said Eric Farnsworth, a former White House adviser and State Department official, who is now a Latin America expert at the Council of the Americas and Americas Society.\nHe said the port bolstered China\u2019s powerful position in Peru and created a \u201cpoint of leverage\u201d in the region.\nTwo regional diplomats said it also reflected a more muscular and ambitious China, often backed by deep pockets: a far cry from a wave of Chinese immigration to Peru two centuries ago when migrants came as cotton workers or to set up \u2018chifas\u2019 \u2014 Chinese food outlets.\n\u201cNow business executives or bankers come, with big projects tucked under their belts,\u201d said Juan Carlos Capu\u00f1ay, Peru\u2019s former ambassador to China.\n\u2018New battleground for minerals\u2019\nChina hasn\u2019t had things all its own way. Its Belt and Road has faced pushback in Asia and Europe \u2014 Italy recently pulled out of the initiative \u2014 while bad debts owed to China have ballooned. In Latin America, projects from Argentina to Venezuela have faced hold-ups.\nDiplomats and trade experts also cautioned that the Chancay port would only be successful if regional infrastructure including roads and railways improved to enable goods to get there, including grains from Brazil.\nCurrently, the Interocean Highway \u2014 a little-used road corridor of some 2,600km in five sections, built more than a decade ago \u2014 links the Pacific Coast in the south of Peru to Brazil\u2019s state of Acre.\n\u201cThe issue today is a lack of regional connections, which is very complex for the success of the project,\u201d said Fernando Reyes Matta, former Chilean ambassador to China.\nNonetheless, several of the people said China\u2019s rise in South America was solidifying despite these headwinds, with the region desperate for financing and foreign currency.\nA senior European diplomat based in South America said the big gap in infrastructure funding in the region made it hard for the United States to \u201cstrong arm\u201d local governments to turn down Chinese money.\nMeanwhile, global interest had grown in South America\u2019s resources such as lithium, copper and grains.\n\u201cLatin America has become a new battle ground for those minerals between the United States, Europe and China,\u201d he said.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nHow much do hotel reviews (e.g., TripAdvisor, Google Reviews) influence your accommodation choice?\nVery important, I always check reviews before booking\nSomewhat important, I check reviews if I\u2019m unsure\nNeutral, I don\u2019t pay much attention to reviews\nNot important at all, I don\u2019t check reviews\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nBelt and Road\nPeru\nChina trade\nDo you like the content of this article?\nCOMMENT\n(11)",

The region is connected to Vietnam by land, sea and air, and it is served by over 30 international cargo and passenger services which depart from its three international airports and three deep-sea ports.\nLocal authorities are hoping these facilities will attract more businesses and tourists from Southeast Asia to visit the region, and vice versa, according to Dong Changting, the deputy director of External Publicity and Exchange Department of Guangxi Zhuang Automomous Region.\nADVERTISEMENT\nGuangxi is also known for having one of the highest numbers of education institutions which provide Thai language courses to Chinese students.\nRELATED\nbusiness\nL'Or\u00e9al outlines people-driven workplace transformation\nopinion\nTowards strategic Thai-French ties\nA growing number of Chinese students are interested in taking up Thai lessons in Guangxi prior to leaving for Thailand. Similarly, a source said, an increasing number of Thais are also coming to Guangxi to learn Chinese.\nThe Chinese government is keen to facilitate language exchanges as it expands its reach in the region through its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), the source said, noting such exchanges also boost the nation's soft power capacity, which it needs to maintain its influence over its allies.\nBRI is a major infrastructure push launched by the Chinese government, which Beijing envisions would ultimately link all major trade routes across Asia, Europe and Africa.\nPrime location\nDeputy Prime Minister and Commerce Minister, Phumtham Wechayachai, has said Guangxi's location and proximity to Southeast Asia makes it an ideal gateway for Thai agricultural exports to China, such as jasmine rice, durian, grapefruit and longans.\nThe reason, he said, is because the autonomous region is well equipped to handle land and marine cargo shipments, allowing Thai products to reach the markets faster than if they had gone through a different gateway.\nRecently, authorities in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region hosted a China-Asean expo to boost cooperation between Chinese businesses and their Asean counterparts, in which they showcased the region's rapid development and modernisation.\nThe trip was organised by the Propaganda Department of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Guangxi Branch of China News Service.\nKnown for Guilin\nBefore Guangxi became a modern and popular trade hub, it was first known for its natural attractions, chief among which is Guilin, which is world-famous for its beguiling limestone karst formations.\nThe landscape around Guiling is so renowned that it is featured on the 20-yuan banknote, said Ma Tieqiao, chairman of Guilin Junda Transportation Company, which offers leisure cruises along the Li Jiang River.\nIn the past, he said, most tourists would have to get on bamboo rafts, which are only big enough for about three people, or risk getting crammed into a small boat for larger groups.\nAs the number of tourists continue to grow, in 1985 the Guilin Sightseeing Shipping Co was founded to provide improved services for local and international visitors.\nThe move proved to be successful and now scores of leisure boats cruise along the Li Jiang River everyday, he said.\nHome to high-tech industry\nNow, Guilin is increasingly becoming known as a hub for high-tech industries.\nThe rapid transformation started in 1988, when Guilin High-Tech Industrial Development Zone was established. It was upgraded into a high-tech special development zone in 1991, becoming the first national-level high-tech zone across China's five autonomous regions.\nIn just 30 years, Guilin has become one of the leaders in scientific innovation and industrial development.\nOne example of a successful company based in the region is Guangxi Guilin Zhishen Information Technology Company, which produces anti-shake tripods for cameras and other equipment for digital photography, as well as mobile phones.\nThe company has won several awards such as the iF Design Award, the Red Dot Award and the Excellent Design Award, according to the company.\nIn addition, Guigang, which is located in eastern Guangxi, has been designated as a hub for electric vehicle (EV) manufacturers. The city is home to more than 100 EV-related businesses, including e-bike producers, machine components and vehicle parts manufacturers.\nHaving an EV production base in Guigang will give China more opportunities to export its EVs to countries in Southeast Asia, said a representative of Guangxi Luyuan Electric Vehicle Company, which manufactures and distributes electric motorbikes and e-bicycles.\nHe said as the electric vehicle industry has become more popular in the world, the company expects to expand its reach to many countries in Southeast Asia.\nEVs will be a solution for the green energy ecosystem, he said.\nThe Sun and Moon Pagodas are illuminated at night in the Fir Lake, one of popular tourism sites in Guilin.

EU President Ursula von der Leyen told Chinese leader Xi Jinping on Thursday that the bloc and its biggest trading partner must address their differences, as they began the first in-person EU-China summit in over four years.\nChina and the EU have ramped up diplomatic engagement this year in an attempt to steer post-pandemic recovery and repair damaged ties, with a number of its commissioners visiting Beijing to restart high-level dialogue.\nAnd in opening remarks, von der Leyen, flanked by European Council President Charles Michel and EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell, thanked Xi for the \"warm welcome\" on what is her second trip to China this year.\nADVERTISEMENT\nAds powered by\n\"But there are clear imbalances and differences that we must address,\" she said.\nRELATED\nworld\nWar in Ukraine: latest developments\nworld\nChina policeman tells of shooting Kunming attackers\n\"At times our interests coincide,\" she said, pointing to EU-China cooperation on artificial intelligence and climate change.\n\"And when they do not, we need to address and responsibly manage the concerns that we have,\" she said.\nMichel, in turn, said the bloc was seeking a \"stable and mutually beneficial\" relationship with China.\nBut, he said, the EU would also \"promote our European values including human rights and democracy\" at the summit.\nThe bloc says it hopes the meetings will provide a chance to discuss areas of common interest.\nIn his opening remarks, President Xi told his European visitors they must \"jointly respond to global challenges\".\nThursday's talks are set to address more touchy topics too, from human rights and Beijing's continued ties with Russia despite its war in Ukraine to the yawning EU-China trade gap.\nVon der Leyen warned this week that the bloc would \"not tolerate\" that imbalance indefinitely.\n\"We have tools to protect our market,\" she told AFP.\nBeijing hit back on Wednesday, saying the bloc's efforts to curb exports of sensitive tech to China while balancing trade didn't \"make sense\".\nEuropean officials have said repeatedly this year they aim to \"derisk\" their economic ties to China after the war in Ukraine exposed the continent's energy dependence on Russia.\n- 'Zero trust' -\nBeijing's goal this week will be to \"hinder or delay derisking at a minimum cost\", Grzegorz Stec, an analyst at China-focused think tank MERICS, told a media briefing Wednesday.\nBeijing will attempt to \"project the image of a responsible global actor and to reassure European actors about the direction of the Chinese economy\", Stec said.\nBut on the eve of the summit, news broke that Italy had withdrawn from China's vast Belt and Road infrastructure initiative.\nPrime Minister Giorgia Meloni has long been opposed to Italy's participation in an initiative viewed by many as an attempt by Beijing to buy political influence -- and whose economic benefits to Rome were limited.\nAlso on the agenda at the summit will be the fighting between Israel and Hamas -- as well as Russia's war in Ukraine.\nChina, which has not condemned Moscow's February 2022 invasion of its neighbour, welcomed Russian President Vladimir Putin to Beijing in October, with Xi hailing their \"deep friendship\".\nSuch camaraderie is unlikely in Thursday's talks with EU leaders, who one analyst said had \"zero trust\" in Beijing.\n\"Both sides are unlikely to get what they want from the other side,\" Nicholas Bequelin, a senior fellow at Yale's Paul Tsai China Center, told AFP.\n- Few offramps -\nBeijing has said the meeting will \"play an important role in building on the past and ushering in the future\".\n\"China and Europe are partners, not rivals, and their common interests far outweigh their differences,\" foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said this week.\nVon der Leyen and Michel's schedule in the Chinese capital on Thursday will be tight.\nThe EU chiefs' meeting with Xi will be followed by a working lunch.\nThey will then hold talks with Premier Li Qiang before attending an official dinner and a news conference in the evening.\nThe Europeans have said they will urge Beijing to use its ties with Moscow to push it to end its war against Ukraine.\nWhile China has stopped short of providing military aid to Moscow, it has deepened economic ties as Western powers seek to isolate Russia.\nWar in the Middle East and tensions over self-ruled Taiwan will also feature prominently in the talks, the bloc has said.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat is your budget range for renting a condominium?\nUnder 10,000 THB/month\n10,000 -

What we're trying to do is change the relationship for the better,\" Biden told reporters at the White House before heading to San Francisco.\nAsked what he hoped to achieve at the meeting, he said he wanted \"to get back on a normal course of corresponding; being able to pick up the phone and talk to one another if there's a crisis; being able to make sure our (militaries) still have contact with one another.\"\nBut Biden also warned that the United States was wary of investing in China due to Beijing's business practices.\n\"I'm not going to continue to sustain the support for positions where if we want to invest in China, we have to turn over all our trade secrets,\" he said.\nThe two presidents are expected to meet for several hours Wednesday on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in San Francisco.\nThe forum brings together 21 economies, which together account for about 60 percent of the world economy.\nThey are both also expected to meet major business leaders, and hold a number of other bilateral meetings.\n- Spy balloon -\nPositive momentum from November 2022 talks between Xi and Biden in Bali was derailed when the United States shot down what it said was a Chinese spy balloon, delaying a planned visit to Beijing by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken.\nSince then, a flurry of high-level diplomacy, including Blinken's eventual trip to China in June, has signaled a willingness on both sides to mend ties.\nAsked about Beijing's expectations for the summit, a spokesman for China's foreign ministry was vague, mentioning \"in-depth communication\" and \"major issues concerning world peace.\"\nChina routinely warns it will not budge on issues it considers \"red lines,\" such as Taiwan, a self-ruling island off its coast that Beijing claims as its own territory, and its expansion into the South China Sea.\nBut Washington and Beijing have recently made some progress on trade and economic relations, and climate change talks.\nThe United States and its Western allies once viewed emerging China as a friend in waiting, believing that as it became wealthier, it would become more liberal and fit in with the US-dominated global order.\nBut over the last decade that view has all but disappeared in Western capitals as the openness that heralded its hosting of the 2008 Olympic Games has faded.\nBeijing has become more authoritarian under Xi, and has increasingly begun to throw its weight around on the international stage, including spending hundreds of billions of dollars on infrastructure development in third countries as part of its \"Belt and Road\" initiative.\nAt the same time, making nice with China has fallen out of favor in Washington, as domestic politics have taken on an increasingly protectionist bent.\nThat tendency accelerated under former president Donald Trump, who delighted his base by imposing punitive sanctions on Chinese imports in what he said was a bid to re-shore US manufacturing.\nBut the mood music has sweetened slightly in recent months, and Biden said Tuesday a less confrontational relationship with China would benefit both sides.\n\"If in fact the Chinese people, who are in trouble right now economically, if the average homeowner, if the average citizen in China, was able to have a decent paying job -- that benefits them, and benefits all of us,\" Biden said Tuesday.\nXi will have dinner with top US business leaders on his trip, and is expected to push for a relaxation of US trade curbs in his talks with Biden.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat is your budget range for renting a condominium?\nUnder 10,000 THB/month\n10,000 - 20,000 THB/month\n20,000 - 40,000 THB/month\n40,000 - 60,000 THB/month\nOver 60,000 THB/month\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nDo you like the content of this article?\n0\n2\nCOMMENT\n(1)",

They took a field trip to Urumqi, Ili and Kashgar, arranged by the State Council Information Office of China.\nRELATED\nworld\nUK should outlaw imports made by Xinjiang forced labour: lawmaker\nopinion\nPM has much to prove\nThey also attended forums to exchange knowledge with Chinese researchers about their views on Xinjiang.\nThe topics included \"Protecting the Freedom of Religion by Muslims in Xinjiang\", \"Cognitive Warfare or Journalistic Practice: Information Manipulation by Some Countries on Xinjiang Issues\" and \"Fighting Terrorism and Extremism\".\nThese seminars were aimed at showing the changes which Xinjiang has undergone in the past seven years or so.\nWith a population of more than 10 million, Xinjiang is also known as home to Uighurs, one of the Chinese autonomous region's four largest ethnic groups. Once a violence-plagued region, Xinjiang is now seen as an important economic area which serves also as a connecting hub for high-speed train routes in the BRI.\nThe Chinese hosts pointed to what they said was freedom of religious practices in Xinjiang, such as development of education, healthcare and housing welfare.\nThey were designed to counter the negative images of Xinjiang and China as a whole by some Western media giants.\nZheng Liang, a Chinese researcher, said the media had been exploited as a tool to make false accusations against China regarding its handling of violence in Xinjiang.\nHe played an audio clip containing a remark by Lawrence Wilkerson, former US chief of staff to former secretary of state Colin Powell and a retired army colonel, when he was speaking at the Ron Paul Institute in August, 2018.\n\"The third reason we were in Afghanistan is because there are 20 million Uighurs in Xinjiang. The CIA would want to destabilise China and that would be the best way to do it, to foment unrest and to join with those Uighurs in pushing the Han Chinese in Beijing,\" the colonel said in the clip.\nMr Zheng also presented an analysis of the BBC's coverage of Xinjiang's past violence which he found to be intentionally distorted.\nOn one occasion, the BBC claimed its correspondent was ordered by the Chinese police to stop filming around a factory said to be a site of forced labour against Uighurs, said Mr Zheng.\nThe truth was the police were actually security guards at the factory and were merely trying to warn the BBC team to wear a face mask during the Covid-19 pandemic.\nOn another occasion, the BBC published mugshots of what it claimed to be 2,000 Xinjiang police found involved in the mass abduction and judicial killing of more than 1,000 Uighurs, he said.\nAs it turned out, two of the mugshots actually belonged to Hong Kong actors, Donald Chow and Andy Lau, he said.\nWang Jiang, a professor and associate dean at the Institute of China's Borderland Studies, Zhejiang Normal University, admitted the reduction in violence in Xinjiang in the past seven years resulted partially from measures imposed to fight Covid-19.\nThey included China's border closures which lasted for over three years and stringent controls on the internet in China which made it almost impossible for outsiders to incite violence through the internet, he said.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat is your budget range for purchasing a condominium?\nUnder 2 million THB\n2 million - 4 million THB\n4 million - 7 million THB\n7 million - 10 million THB\nOver 10 million THB\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nXinjiang\nDo you like the content of this article?\n5\n32\nCOMMENT\n(14)",

That said, speed is not always of the essence when the project in question has a considerable impact on the country.\nOne such scheme is the land bridge, a logistic megaproject which aims to connect the Andaman Sea and the Indian Ocean to the Gulf of Thailand and, ultimately, the Pacific Ocean. The government said the project would be a boon to connectivity in the South and reduce shipping times by allowing ships to bypass the congested Strait of Malacca.\nThe cabinet approved the scheme on Oct 14, and the government plans to launch a roadshow to attract foreign investment. In fact, Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin had already launched his sales pitch at the 10th Anniversary of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) in China last week. He said the project aligns with Beijing's BRI schemes, which will improve China's connectivity to the region and beyond.\nADVERTISEMENT\nIt was reported that the government is considering granting the concession to build and operate the land bridge to a private company. It is estimated the entire project will cost at least one trillion baht to build.\nRELATED\nworld\nLast marine heat wave providing lessons for the future\nthailand\nPhatthalung to push airport plan\nWhile the project looks good on paper, the government must carefully weigh its pros and cons. It must be noted that the land bridge isn't exactly a novel idea. The first plan to carve out a route to connect Thailand's east and west coasts was conceived over 300 years ago.\nThe idea to excavate a canal across the Isthmus of Kra between Chumphon and Ranong persisted for centuries, but each time the plan resurfaced, it was struck down over national security concerns.\nAfter all, if built, the canal would physically divide the kingdom in two.\nThe Kra Canal proposal was revived by the Prayut Chan-o-cha administration, which revised it slightly to minimise the need to split the country into two parts by swapping the canal for a \"land bridge\" supported by high-speed rail and land transport connections.\nThe problem, as such, no longer concerns national security but economic viability.\nOver the past five decades, various governments have commissioned around 15 studies to look into the feasibility of building such a canal and whether or not shipping companies would use it to bypass the Malacca Strait.\nThe majority, however, concluded the scheme's economic benefits were overstated.\nThe Prayut administration also had the National Economic and Social Development Council and Chulalongkorn University conduct their own feasibility study of the project. In the end, both suggested the government improve the existing logistics infrastructure instead.\nThis time, the government must determine if the scheme is just a pipe dream or a promising logistic project. It must bear in mind that the Andaman Sea is a priceless tourism resource which must be protected from delusional mega projects.\nThat means the government needs to listen to experts' questions and criticisms.\nOne of the questions that needs to be answered is whether or not shipping companies will use the land bridge, as they must pay extra costs and spend time to load and unload containers from the docks to the land bridge before they can reach their final destination.\nThe Srettha government must not act like a salesman who focuses solely on selling goods. It needs to carefully choose which development project will benefit the country the most.\nEditorial\nBangkok Post editorial column\nThese&nbsp;editorials represent Bangkok Post&nbsp;thoughts about current issues and situations.\nEmail :\nanchaleek@bangkokpost.co.th\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat type of hotel location do you prefer in Thailand?\nBeachfront resorts\nCity-center hotels (close to shopping, restaurants, attractions\nSecluded, nature retreats\nNear airports for convenience\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nLand bridge\nDo you like the content of this article?\n58\n2\nCOMMENT\n(28)",

(Photo: Xinhua)\nChina and Serbia have agreed to remove tariffs on up to 90 per cent of each other's imported goods in a free-trade agreement signed as President Xi Jinping hailed the country as an \"ironclad friend\".\nIt marked Beijing's first free-trade deal struck with a country in Central and Eastern Europe, and the fourth with a European country after Switzerland, Iceland and Georgia.\nThe accord also came at a time when Beijing aims to widen its global trade network to counter external headwinds and ensure its footing in the global supply chain. The European Union (EU) and the US, meanwhile, are seeking to de-risk to limit their reliance on the world's second-largest economy.\nADVERTISEMENT\nAds powered by\nChina and Serbia began talk of a deal in April, including two rounds of formal negotiation and nearly 30 work-level conferences, and signed the agreement on Tuesday at the sidelines of the Third Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation in Beijing.\n\"China and Serbia will realise high-level opening up to each other via the free trade deal, set up new institutional arrangements for bilateral trade and economic cooperation, and create a more preferential, convenient, transparent and stable business environment,\" China's Ministry of Commerce said on Wednesday, adding the deal will \"promote investment, forge closer supply chains and enhance global competitiveness\".\nBilateral trade rose one-tenth in 2022 to US$3.56 billion from the previous year, official data showed. China is Serbia's second-largest trading partner, after the EU.\nChina's exports of automobiles, photovoltaic modules, lithium batteries and telecoms equipment will enjoy zero tariffs once the deal takes effect, down from the current rate of 5 to 20 per cent. Serbia's power generators, electric motors, tires, beef, honey and other agricultural products will also be free of import tariffs upon entering the Chinese market.\nSerbian President Aleksandar Vucic led a delegation to the forum, including senior economic and military officials.\nVucic said the deal will bring more jobs, increase tax revenue and grow the economy, the Chinese embassy in Serbia said on Thursday, citing a local report.\nChina has free-trade agreements with 22 countries and regions. Despite marathon talks lasting seven years, a landmark free trade and investment agreement with the European Union has been in limbo since 2021 as bilateral relations deteriorated and Beijing and Brussels exchanged sanctions over human rights issues.\nIn a move all but certain to cloud trade relations further, the EU has launched an anti-subsidy probe into Chinese exports of electric vehicles and is mulling more investigations besides, citing unfair trade practices.\nThe bloc is also attempting to lessen its reliance on China by diversifying supply chains elsewhere in a practice it terms \"de-risking\".\nIn a separate deal, Chinese railway manufacturer CRRC signed an agreement with the Serbian ministry of transport and infrastructure to sell 20 high-speed rail carriages to the country, the first Chinese exports of bullet trains to Europe.\nThe carriages will have a maximum speed of 200kph (124mph) and run on the Hungary-Serbia railway connecting Budapest and Belgrade. The rail line is a flagship European project for China's Belt and Road Initiative, a sweeping plan for infrastructure development.\nThey are expected to enter into operation in 2025, according to state media.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat is your preferred price range per night for accommodation in Bangkok?\n1,000 - 3,000 THB\n3,000 - 5,000 THB\n5,000 - 8,000 THB\nOver 8,000 THB\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nDo you like the content of this article?\n14\n17\nCOMMENT\n(1)",

This includes transport, energy, and infrastructure.\nNew technologies and digital transformation will be invaluable to this shift, but their responsible use and equitable access must be ensured, he said.\n\"For our part, Thailand is actively implementing our long-term low greenhouse gas emission development strategy. We have realigned our national energy plan to shift consumption to clean energy, and also promote energy efficiency.\n\"We aim to increase the production of zero-emission vehicles to 30% by 2030, while encouraging foreign investment in the electric vehicle sector. We also plan to scale up sustainable agronomy to reduce climate change vulnerability and improve farmers' well-being.\n\"I am optimistic that these policies will help us reach our national targets of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 40% by 2030, achieving carbon neutrality by 2050, and net-zero emissions by 2065,'' he said.\nSecond, Mr Srettha said Thailand recognises the importance of environmental and ecosystem conservation.\nA sketch by Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin shows where the Land Bridge project has been designated. He introduced it to a group of Chinese business leaders on the sidelines of the 3rd Belt and Road Forum (BRF) for International Cooperation in Beijing on Tuesday.\nHe said the country aims to expand green areas up to 55% of the country's total area. As for marine and coastal biodiversity, the nation is committed to the \"30 by 30 Target\" for protected areas, he said, citing a pledge made at COP15 in Montreal, Canada, in December 2022.\nThailand believes that sustainable blue economy will be crucial to achieve a Green Maritime Silk Road, he added.\nThird, an environmentally sound financing mechanism will be an indispensable tool for the green transition. Thailand has raised US$12.5 billion so far by issuing sustainability bonds to fund multiple projects. Soon the government will introduce sustainability linked bonds to boost the green bonds market, Mr Srettha said.\nThis will also incentivise all entities to support the private sector and MSMEs as they engage in eco-friendly businesses.\nMr Srettha said on the 10th anniversary of the BRI, he commended China for the achievements made under the wildly ambitious scheme. This globe-spanning infrastructure project, still in its early stage, has already brought prosperity to millions of people.\nDespite being a relatively small nation, Thailand aims to take lessons from this mega-project and implement these at home where possible, he said.\nJust recently, the Thai cabinet affirmed a study and implementation plan for the Land Bridge project. This will connect the Andaman Sea and the Indian Ocean to the Gulf of Thailand and the Pacific Ocean, improving connectivity in the southern Andaman region. It will also reduce commute times going via the Strait of Malacca.\nGovernment spokesman Chai Wacharonke said on Wednesday&nbsp;that China Harbour Engineering Company Limited (CHEC), one of the country's top engineering firms, is interested in joining Thailand's southern Land Bridge megaproject, worth an estimated 1 trillion baht.\nCHEC chairman Wang Tongzhou expressed interest during a meeting with Mr Srettha on the sidelines of the BRF.\nMr Srettha welcomed the firm's enthusiasm and urged it to hold talks with the Board of Investment (BOI) to learn more about investment privileges.\nHe also asked the company to consider opening a regional office in Thailand. The timeline for the project includes an overseas roadshow from November to January to drum up foreign investment.

It seems as though there is a concerted effort to cast a shadow over this monumental endeavour.\nIn the prevailing discourse on the BRI, Western think tanks have raised concerns regarding its potential environmental impact along its expansive route. They argue that the BRI must align with the Paris Agreement and prioritise environmental sustainability.\nADVERTISEMENT\nHowever, it is crucial to evaluate the BRI from a balanced standpoint that recognises its immense potential benefits, as well as China's steadfast dedication to environmental safety. While it is undeniable that the Belt and Road Initiative's construction activities may have an impact on the environment, it is essential to acknowledge that similar challenges are prevalent in all the development projects worldwide.\nChina's commitment to a green economy and its capacity to address environmental concerns along the BRI route set an example. While these concerns are valid, it is essential to recognise that construction and development projects are ongoing worldwide, irrespective of the BRI's existence. Hence, the demand for environmentally friendly policies should not be limited to the BRI alone.\nRELATED\nlife\nCelebrate a sustainable and giving festive season\nthailand\nR.X. reinforces leadership in health via RXLIFE&nbsp;at Sustainability Forum 2025\nChina, the driving force behind the BRI, is actively transitioning towards a green economy. This commitment reflects China's leadership in balancing economic development with environmental responsibility on a global scale.\nAs the BRI continues to shape the global landscape, its expansion into various dimensions, including the Digital Silk Road, Health Silk Road, and Polar Silk Road, underscores the initiative's evolving nature and commitment to addressing pressing global challenges.\nAmong these dimensions, the Green Silk Road stands out as a beacon of hope for a world grappling with environmental crises and the urgent need for sustainable development. The Green Silk Road, a crucial component of the BRI, represents China's resolute commitment to making its projects greener and more sustainable. The world is increasingly prioritising sustainable development as the need to address climate change and environmental degradation becomes more urgent. The Green Silk Road serves as an effective solution for implementing the UN's 2030 Agenda. To fulfil these ambitious targets, China recognises the importance of promoting sustainability not only within its borders but also in the regions connected through the BRI.\nChina has actively promoted the Green Silk Road through the establishment of guidelines and partnership agreements. The Green Investment Principles (GIP) for the BRI, introduced in late 2018, provide a framework for greener investments in BRI participant countries and regions. In mid-2021, China published the Green Development Guidelines for Overseas Investment and Cooperation, as well as the Guidelines for Ecological and Environmental Protection of Foreign Investment Cooperation and Construction Projects. These programmes focus on managing environmental risks associated with overseas BRI projects and supply chains, further underlining China's commitment to sustainability.\nA key aspect of China's commitment to sustainability within the BRI is the shift away from coal-related investments. Conversely, China has significantly increased its investments in renewable energy, including solar, wind, and hydropower within BRI-involved regions. In 2022, investments in these green energy sectors saw a 50% year-on-year increase. China's dominance in renewable energy manufacturing, accounting for 72% of global solar manufacturing and 50% of global wind turbine manufacturing, positions it as a crucial contributor to low-carbon technologies for BRI countries and regions.\nCollaboration between Chinese officials, local governments, and corporations in BRI-involved regions has also led to the development of green infrastructure. In the sphere of environmental conservation, China has demonstrated its commitment by engaging in approximately 50 agreements with stakeholders within the BRI framework over the past decade.\nMoreover, in 2021, China's total renewable energy use reached 750 million tonnes of standard coal, leading to a reduction of 2.1 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions. At the same time, China holds the distinction of being the global leader in the production of solar panels, wind turbines, batteries, and electric vehicles (EVs). This status uniquely positions China to facilitate the delivery of cutting-edge, low-carbon technologies to the Emerging Markets and Developing Economies (EMDEs) engaged in the BRI. Currently, the GIP boasts more than 41 signatories with combined assets exceeding US$49 trillion, providing substantial funding for BRI projects. The Green Silk Road within the BRI represents a forward-looking commitment to sustainability, environmental protection, and global cooperation. Contrary to the negative framing by Western critics, the actual reality of the BRI is quite different from this narrative. China's dedication to sustainable development through the Green Silk Road offers a compelling vision for the future of global infrastructure and connectivity.\nDr Imran Khalid is a freelance contributor based in Karachi, Pakistan.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat hotel facilities are most important to you when choosing accommodation?\nSwimming pool\nFitness center\nRestaurants and bars\nMassage and spa\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nSustainability\nDo you like the content of this article?\n6\n16\nCOMMENT",

(Photo: AFP)\nBEIJING - Chinese President Xi Jinping hailed his close friendship with Vladimir Putin on Wednesday as he hosted the Russian leader for talks that celebrated their nations' deepening political and economic ties.\nPutin, on his first trip to a major global power since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, met his \"old friend\" Xi at Beijing's Great Hall of the People on the sidelines of a major forum.\n\"The political mutual trust between the two countries is continuously deepening,\" Xi said, according to Xinhua news agency, hailing their \"close and effective strategic coordination\".\nADVERTISEMENT\nXi noted that he had met with Putin 42 times in the past decade, saying they had \"developed a good working relationship and a deep friendship\".\nRELATED\nworld\nSouth America hails new BRICS bank\nworld\nSouth America hails new BRICS bank\nPutin is the guest of honour at a summit hosted by Xi in Beijing to celebrate his Belt and Road Initiative, a vast trade and infrastructure project.\nDespite international attention focused on the Israel-Gaza conflict, neither Xi nor Putin made public comments on the war that has raged for more than 10 days.\nThe Chinese president did, however, call for joint efforts by China and Russia to \"safeguard international fairness\" and \"justice\", Xinhua said.\nChina is Russia's largest trading partner, with exchange between the nations reaching a record $190 billion last year, Beijing customs data shows.\nAnd Xi said Wednesday it was progressing towards a goal of $200 billion set by the two countries in bilateral meetings this year.\nBeijing has drawn criticism from Western countries for its stance on the Ukraine war, on which China insists it is neutral. It has refused to criticise Moscow's invasion.\nPutin is on a mission to strengthen the already strong bond with his communist neighbour, though experts say Moscow is increasingly the junior partner in the relationship.\nIn his talks with \"dear friend\" Xi, he stressed the importance of \"close coordination in foreign policy\" in \"the current difficult conditions\".\n\"And we are doing it, and today we will discuss this,\" Putin was quoted as saying in a Kremlin readout.\nChina's state broadcaster CCTV reported shortly before 3pm that the tete-a-tete had finished, carrying footage of Putin being whisked away in a motorcade.\n'Oppose unilateral sanctions'\nRepresentatives of 130 countries including Thailand are in the Chinese capital for the two-day talking shop that wraps up on Wednesday.\nEarlier Xi said in a speech to the international delegates that his country rejected \"economic coercion\" and \"bloc confrontation\".\nIn an apparent reference to China's rivalry with the United States, Xi said Beijing would not engage in \"ideological confrontation, geopolitical games or bloc confrontation\".\n\"We oppose unilateral sanctions, economic coercion, decoupling and delinking,\" Xi told delegates.\n\"Viewing the development of others as a threat and economic interdependence as a risk will not make one's own life any better or one's own development any faster,\" he said.\nInstead, Xi said, the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) would seek to \"inject new impetus into the global economy\".\n\"We deeply believe that only when there is win-win cooperation can things get done, and get done well,\" he said.\nHe also pledged to inject over $100 billion of new funding into BRI projects.\nPutin then took to the stage, hailing the infrastructure initiative as a \"success story\".\n\"Given the global dimensions of the initiative the Chinese leader launched a decade ago, frankly, one could hardly expect to make it work,\" Putin said in his address to delegates.\n\"Our Chinese friends are making it work. We are glad to see this success story as it means a lot to many of us.\"\nAt an official banquet on Tuesday, Xi delivered a toast in which he alluded to recent conflicts, but added that \"the historical (trend) of peace\" was \"unstoppable\".\nMiddle East envoy\nThe United States has asked China to use its influence to help de-escalate the Israel-Hamas conflict, which erupted after the Palestinian militant group launched an attack in Israel, killing 1,400 people.\nIsrael then launched a withering air campaign against Gaza, which has seen more than a million people in the blockaded territory flee their homes. About 3,000 Gazans have died in Israeli bombardments, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.\nChina, which brokered a detente between key Hamas backer Iran and its regional foe Saudi Arabia this year, said it would send its Middle East envoy Zhai Jun to the volatile region this week.\nNo details have been given about where or when exactly Zhai would travel, though CCTV has said he will push for a ceasefire and peace talks.\nRussia, which has traditionally maintained good relations with both Israeli and Palestinian authorities, has called for an \"immediate ceasefire\" in the conflict.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat type of house are you most interested in?\nSingle-family home\nTownhouse\nSemi-detached house\nVilla\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nDo you like the content of this article?\n2\n0\nCOMMENT",

The event, which was held on June 24-26, forged an economic network linking Chinese entrepreneurs worldwide.\u2009Apichart Jinakul\nBilateral trade ties with China will continue to deepen but the new government must strive to remain neutral in any US-China conflict, according to the president of the Thai-Chinese Chamber of Commerce (TCCC).\nIn an interview with the Bangkok Post, TCCC president Narongsak Puttapornmongkol said the Chinese economy might experience a hiccup during the ongoing conflict with the United States but the situation can also create opportunities for Thailand.\nMr Narongsak said he encourages Chinese enterprises that export to the US or Europe to expand their investment in Thailand so they can use materials in the kingdom to produce their goods. Many firms are enthusiastic about relocating to Thailand, he said.\nADVERTISEMENT\nFurthermore, some US firms are looking for new places to set up manufacturing bases, especially in Asia. Thailand should harness the opportunity, he said.\nMr Narongsak said Thailand enjoys close ties with China while Thailand and the US have always been good allies. He believes the new government led by Srettha Thavisin will help balance the power of the two global leaders and maintain positive trade ties with both.

For example, foreign companies that have a business in Thailand must let Thai shareholders control at least 51% of their company.\nThey also need to pay, except those granted tax incentives from the Board of Investment or the Eastern Economic Corridor.\n\"There is no need to be overly concerned because any business needs to pay tax. In addition, when authorities strictly enforce laws, it scares away shady Chinese businesses from coming to Thailand,\" he said.\nThe trade deficit with China is not a big issue because Thailand can use imported materials from China to produce goods and later export them to other countries.\nMr Narongsak also referred to Thai firms that want to invest in China, saying the Chinese government has special economic zones (SEZ) to welcome foreign investors such as SEZs in Hainan and Zhuhai.\nHe suggested investing in businesses that Thailand is known for, such as the food industry. If a Thai company can sell even one product in China, it would open a huge potential market because of its 1.4 billion population.\nHe also praised the government for launching a visa-exception scheme for Chinese nationals. The policy is timely as it was launched before Chinese National Day on Oct 1, which is a marked with a week-long holiday.\nMr Narongsak said the government should expedite its high-speed railway project as it has some missing segments that would link it to the China-Laos high-speed railway project built under China's Belt and Road Initiative.\n\"The high-speed project may not be finished in the term of the Srettha government. But the government should speed up a double-track railway project and urgently complete the 160km segment from Khon Kaen to Nong Khai, on the border to Laos, to improve the country's logistics crossing from Laos to China,\" he said.\nMr Narongsak said the dual-track railway system will enable passenger trains to run faster at a maximum speed of 110km per hour. Trains will not have to change tracks -- an inconvenience of the present single railway system -- while a cargo train can run at 70km/h.\nThe dual track railway system will allow trains to run at speeds almost on par with the average speed of 160km/h marked by the China-Laos high-speed train, he said.\nHe also suggested the government consider opening the customs service in Nong Khai and other border checkpoints around the clock, as well as providing a one-stop service to ease cross-border trade.\nThis step could be completed within a year, while waiting for the dual-track railway system to be finished, he said.\n\"I had a chance to talk with the premier and asked him to extend the working hours along the borders as Thailand would earn more income from collecting fees from land and sea freight,\" he said.\nMr Narongsak said the relationship between Thailand and China has improved, especially after Chinese President Xi Jinping paid courtesy calls to His Majesty the King and then Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha last year.\nMore Chinese business operators, particularly those in northern China, are aware of the advantages Thailand offers after the TCCC held the World Chinese Entrepreneurs Convention for overseas Chinese entrepreneurs in June.\nThe event attracted more than 4,000 Chinese businesspeople from 50 countries.\nThailand should also offer an attractive investment policy to compete with neighbouring countries, such as Vietnam, Indonesia, Cambodia and Malaysia.\n\"We should let Chinese investors know that they may invest in other countries but Thailand is the best because our country is stable and safe,\" Mr Narongsak said.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat is your budget range for renting a condominium?\nUnder 10,000 THB/month\n10,000 - 20,000 THB/month\n20,000 - 40,000 THB/month\n40,000 - 60,000 THB/month\nOver 60,000 THB/month\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nTrade\nThai-Chinese\nInvestment\nUS\nConflict\nChina\nDo you like the content of this article?\n4\n110\nCOMMENT\n(18)",

An example of this is China's joining of the Brics bloc (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) to counter the influence of the United States and countries in Europe, he said.\nADVERTISEMENT\nBric (without South Africa) was created in 2001, with the hopes that the four countries would dominate the global economy by 2050, he said. South Africa was added to the list in 2010, he said, adding Brics operates as a loose organisation that seeks to further economic cooperation among member nations and increase their global standing, in contrast to Western powers.\nBrics nations have offered to become a source of foreign expansion for firms with strong returns for institutional investors, he said.\nMr Pinit said in terms of power, the world no longer only has the US and Europe. These days, many countries must remain on good terms with China, especially in relation to its Belt and Road Initiative, which aims to drive trade, investments and culture across regions, he said.\nToday, even the Chinese language is popular among people, particularly in African countries and Thailand, he said.\nThis year's National Day celebration will mark China's progress in tackling past issues, such as poverty and starvation, and in becoming one of the world's leading countries, praising the leadership of founder Mao Zedong and current President Xi Jinping, he said.\nIn its prosperity, China has also provided a variety of assistance to many underdeveloped countries in Asia, the Middle East, Africa and South America, he said.\nTherefore, China has played an important role in promoting the global economy, and its policies tend to have a wide international impact, he said. Its large population also impacts the consumption trends of many products, he added.\nOver the 74 years since its founding, basic infrastructure in China has significantly improved, Mr Pinit said. China now has a 20,000 km-long high-speed railway and an expressway network of almost 50,000km, he said.\nIn terms of human resources, China has always attached importance to education, as it believes education plays a key role in shaping the future of its new generation of people of at least 4\u20135 million per year, he said.\nDue to the US-China trade war, the US banned the exports of chips and software to Chinese technology giants, but China retaliated by manufacturing a 7-nanometre chip, he said.\n\"Now, we must look to the future of China as a country that has surpassed many leading countries in technology, including electric cars,\" Mr Pinit said.\nTCCRC's mission\nAsked about the promotion of Thai-China relations via the TCCRC, Mr Pinit said the council first established ties with China in 1976 with cooperation from the Chinese government and the private sector.\nThe TCCRC has also cooperated with China to host a number of events with state officials every year to promote both Thai tourism and exchanges of culture and trade, he said.\nHe said his association has taken part in helping the Thai government promote the One Tambon One Product and Thailand's small and medium-sized enterprises in many Chinese provinces.\nIn the future, the TCCRC will help the government organise a roadshow to promote Thai products and art in Shanghai, he said.\nWhen it comes to tourism promotion, Mr Pinit said relevant state agencies and members of the private sector must help the government come up with new and effective ideas on how to attract more Chinese tourists to visit the country every year.\nHe said he agrees with the government's visa-free policy for Chinese tourists as they are more likely to go on long holidays during National Day and Chinese New Year.\nThailand's role\nAccording to the experts, Thailand must tighten its cooperation with China and its Asean and Greater Mekong neighbours, and Mr Pinit agrees.\n\"We should change the way we see China because of its advancements in technology and elevated education,\" he said.\n\"Thailand must be friendly with every country and act as a centre network to promote reconciliation.\"\nAsked about the new government's positive stance on China, Mr Pinit said Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin and Foreign Affairs Minister Parnpree Bahiddha-Nukara are competent people who understand the ins and outs of China.\nThe government should work closely with Beijing to promote Thai exports in China, he said.\n\"The government must closely work with China to promote [agricultural] products, as well as tourism between the two countries,\" he said.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat type of condominium are you most interested in?\nStudio\n1-bedroom\n2-bedroom\n3-bedroom\nPenthouse\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nDo you like the content of this article?\n2\n11\nCOMMENT",

He and other foreign leaders will meet there with Xi, Chinese state broadcaster CCTV said.\nAccording to the Syrian presidency, he will also visit Beijing.\nThe visit will be Assad's first to China since 2004.\nBeijing has long provided Damascus with diplomatic support, particularly at the UN Security Council where it is a permanent member.\nOfficials from both countries have also made visits over the years.\n\"This visit represents an important rupture in the diplomatic isolation and the political siege imposed on Syria,\" Damascus-based political scientist Oussama Dannoura told AFP.\n\"China has been breaking Western taboos that seek to prevent a number of states from dealing with countries that Washington considers isolated,\" he added.\n- Growing presence -\nThe visit comes as China expands its engagement in the Middle East.\nEarlier this year Beijing brokered a deal that saw longtime regional rivals Saudi Arabia and Damascus backer Iran agree to restore ties and reopen their respective embassies.\nThe detente was followed by Syria's return to the Arab fold at a summit in Saudi Arabia in May, ending more than a decade of Damascus's regional isolation.\nIn 2019, top diplomat Wang Yi told the country's then-foreign minister Walid Muallem that China \"firmly supports Syria's economic reconstruction\" and its efforts to \"combat terrorism\".\nSyria's war began after Assad's repression of peaceful pro-democracy protests escalated into a deadly conflict that pulled in foreign powers and jihadists.\nAssad's regime has branded all opponents -- from non-violent activists to armed rebels and jihadists -- as \"terrorists\".\n\"Assad intends for his trip to China to convey a sense of international legitimacy for his regime and paint a picture of looming Chinese support for reconstruction in Syria,\" said Lina Khatib, director of the Middle East Institute at SOAS.\nKhatib noted that the timing is significant, with Assad now facing protests calling for regime change in southern Syria.\n\"It is unlikely that either (intention) will be convincing to an increasingly restive population in Sweida,\" added Khatib, referring to a Syrian city where protests are ongoing.\n- Economic aid -\nRecent months have seen Beijing roll out the red carpet for a string of autocrats, from Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko to a delegation of officials from Afghanistan's Taliban government.\nAnd foreign minister Wang is this week in Moscow, which faces a raft of Western sanctions over its war in Ukraine.\nAfter welcoming Xi in Moscow earlier this year, Russian President Vladimir Putin is planning a visit to China in October, the Kremlin has said.\nAnalysts expect Assad's visit to China will focus, in part, on funds for reconstruction.\nSyria signed up to China's vast Belt and Road trade and infrastructure initiative in January 2022.\nHaid Haid, a Consulting Fellow at London's Chatham House, wrote on X that \"the focus of this meeting is expected to revolve around convincing China to aid Syria's economic recovery\".\nChina pledged $2 billion in investments in Syria in 2017, Haid noted -- funds that have \"yet to materialise\".\nFor Syria, joining the BRI \"hasn't resulted in significant Chinese investments in Syria, either from the Chinese government or the private sector\", he said.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat type of condominium are you most interested in?\nStudio\n1-bedroom\n2-bedroom\n3-bedroom\nPenthouse\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nDo you like the content of this article?\n0\n1\nCOMMENT\n(2)",

That helps explain why Indonesian President Joko Widodo or Jokowi has to reiterate that Asean needs an extraordinary tactical strategy to face the current global turmoil when he met on Friday with a group of high-level Asean businessmen and investors.\nIt is a well-known fact that the Asean region is and will be the world's fastest-growing economy. It is also peaceful. Therefore, it is up to Asean to draw on the group's collective wisdom, and perhaps, at the right time, it can call the shots.\nPresident Jokowi also emphasised that Asean needs solid collaboration that prioritises mutual interests, both in relations between countries, between entrepreneurs, and between communities. Indeed, at the numerous summits being held this week, Indonesia has the opportunity to show off its diplomatic clout as the world's third-largest democracy and the bloc's largest economy. Throughout past chairmanships, Jakarta has been well aware of its perceived leadership role, both within Asean and in the global context. Most importantly, Jakarta is willing to punch above its weight.\nADVERTISEMENT\nBefore the 43rd summit begins, the 10 Asean leaders will kick off the two-day Asean Indo-Pacific Forum (AIPF), its flagship event. The chair wants to implement the Asean Outlook on the Indo-Pacific (AOIP) after a delay of more than three years. The guidelines were launched in Bangkok during the Thai chairmanship in 2019, just before the Covid-19 outbreak.\nRELATED\nthailand\nNT Highlights Role as ASEAN Digital Hub at TELECOMS WORLD ASIA 2024\nworld\nIndonesia to build 75 GW of renewable energy in next 15 years\nCurrently, there are at least 12 Indo-Pacific frameworks. It is about time Asean reins this in by mainstreaming the AOIP. The AIPF is designed to serve as a platform for all high-level stakeholders, including regional and international officials and representatives, the private sector and others, to meet, connect and match. The inaugural forum will discuss and showcase projects related to infrastructure, digital transformation and the creative economy, as well as sustainable and innovative financing. It is hoped that the forum will later be expanded to cover all areas of priorities under the AOIP, which also include maritime cooperation, connectivity and economic cooperation.\nKey leaders from the dialogue partners are on the list of speakers. US Vice President Kamala Harris is scheduled to attend and give a speech to highlight the US commitment to the region. She has to carry the burden of face-saving for President Joe Biden, who decided to skip the Asean summit even though he is in the neighbourhood.\nGiven the importance of the Indo-Pacific strategy, his absence shows the White House's lack of genuine commitment. Apart from Ms Harris, the forum has lined up heads of governments from Asean's dialogue partners, including China, Japan, South Korea, Australia and Canada. These leaders, who attended the other Asean-related summit, have never missed the opportunity to rub shoulders with others to forge closer ties and cooperation. At the summit, China and Asean plan to issue a joint statement on Mutually Beneficial Cooperation between the AOIP and the Belt and Road Initiative. Although China is still reluctant to accept the concept of the Indo-Pacific, Beijing would like to cooperate with the AOIP on specific projects, especially on connectivity and sustainability. Asean and India will sign a joint statement on maritime cooperation. Before the Asean leaders meet with their dialogue partners on Thursday, they will have their own retreat touching on regional and international issues. Top of the agenda will be the crisis in Myanmar, the South China Sea, the Ukraine-Russia war, and the Korean Peninsula.\nHowever, the ongoing headlines related to Fukushima's wastewater release and the latest Chinese map could dominate Asean leaders' two-hour exchange of views. On the Myanmar quagmire, the chair is expected to issue a statement of Asean leaders' reviews and decisions on the implementation of the Five-point Consensus (5PC). Over the past nine months under Indonesian chairmanship, Asean members have been engaging with all stakeholders on both sides of the conflict. The aims are to instil trust and confidence, build a conducive environment, and narrow gaps and differences to achieve an inclusive dialogue for a comprehensive political solution. The planned statement will also contain concrete, practical and measurable indicators with specific timelines to support activities and programmes under the 5PC. Indonesia is anxious to show the progress it has made during the past nine months through the Office of Asean Special Envoy on Myanmar.\nIn Jakarta, the Asean leaders will have more than a dozen summit meetings over the two-day period with dialogue partners, including the UN and the Asean Plus Three. There will be 21 outcome documents for the Asean Summit and related meetings. The main one will be the Jakarta Declaration: Asean Matters: Epicentrum of Growth, which prescribes joint commitment to promoting Asean centrality, maintaining Asean's role in the region, and operationalising the AOIP. In addition, other documents to be endorsed by the Asean leaders are related to human rights, early childhood educational care development, assistance for people with disabilities and gender equality and family development.\nFurthermore, Canada will have its first summit with the Asean leaders to mark its new status as a strategic partner. Obviously, the global focus then will turn to the outcome of the 18th East Asia Summit (EAS), which comes two months earlier than the previous arrangement. Jakarta did so to accommodate Mr Biden's earlier proposed schedules. Therefore, given its time-sensitive nature, issues chosen by the EAS leaders will also be different and reflect the current situation as those discussed by the Asean leaders. Both the Fukushima affair and the Chinese map will certainly be taken up by some of the EAS leaders. At the EAS in Phnom Penh last year, the tense discussions over the Ukraine-Russia war failed to reach a consensus over the chairman's statement, leaving some of the EAS members to come out with their own leader statements. This time around, Jakarta is doing something different, reiterating that there will be a single EAS leaders' statement by the chair. The purpose is to end confusion and strengthen Asean centrality.\nIndeed, Asean centrality will be further bolstered if all Asean members agree to permit China to accede to the 1995 Treaty of Southeast Asia Nuclear Weapons Free Zone (SEANWFZ). China has reaffirmed time and time again its desire to do so without any reservations. Jakarta hopes Beijing's signature will pave the way for other nuclear powers to make a similar step. However, one of the chair's biggest deliverables has been dashed due to the lack of consensus.\nAsean has been trying in vain for 28 years to persuade the Big Five on the UN Security Council to join the treaty. A new idea has emerged lately after a review of China's intention to attract the remaining nuclear powers to sign up along with their often-stated reservations. All things considered, the Indonesian chair has been quite forceful in boosting the bloc's resilience and capacity to face emerging challenges or disruptions in all dimensions. The question remains whether the incoming Asean chairs will be able to stay on track with the same dynamism.\nKavi Chongkittavorn\nA veteran journalist on regional affairs\nKavi Chongkittavorn is a veteran journalist on regional affairs\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWould you consider buying a house in a gated community or as a standalone property?\nGated community\nStandalone house\nEither, depending on location and price\nNo preference\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nAsean summit\nDo you like the content of this article?\n1\n21\nCOMMENT\n(3)",

This system will be available to all sectors, including producers and partners, enhancing sustainability and transparency in the industry using world-class technology. The initiative reinforces CP\u2019s policy of \u201cno purchase or import of animal feed corn from deforested or burnt areas.\u201d\nYangon, Myanmar \u2013 October 24, 2024\nCharoen Pokphand Group (CP), through Charoen Pokphand Produce (CPP) and Bangkok Produce (BKP), has joined forces with public and private sector partners in Myanmar to launch a traceability system for corn produced by CP for animal feed. This system will be available to producers, partners, and relevant organisations across the supply chain, marking a significant step towards sustainability in Myanmar\u2019s corn industry. A press conference was held in Yangon to announce the project, which includes a pledge not to purchase corn from areas affected by burning or deforestation. The event, held under the Myanmar Corn Traceability Project, included notable attendees such as Mr Mongkol Visittsthumph, Thai Ambassador to Myanmar; Mr Akwat Thanaprasitpattan, Minister Counsellor (Commercial) in Yangon; Mr Titi Lujintanon, Chief Executive Officer of CP\u2019s Feed Ingredients Business; Mr Worrasit Sithiwichai, Chief Operating Officer of Myanmar\u2019s Integrated Crop Business; and Mr U Aye Chan Aung, President of the Myanmar Corn Industrial Association (MCIA). Myanmar corn farmers from areas such as Naung Taya, Shan State, and Mandalay, were also present. The project has garnered support from both Thai and Myanmar participants, all expressing their intent to use the traceability system to foster transparency and sustainability in the Myanmar corn industry.\nMr Mongkol Visittsthumph, the Thai Ambassador to Yangon, stated that this collaboration to enhance traceability in Myanmar\u2019s corn industry is an important step in supporting Thailand\u2019s \u201cClear Sky\u201d strategy, aimed at tackling cross-border haze and PM2.5 pollution from forest burning. The traceability systems showcase private sector responsibility towards the environment, contributing to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly by protecting terrestrial ecosystems and mitigating the effects of climate change. This commitment aligns with the Thai government\u2019s efforts to promote sustainability across the region, reflecting a genuine desire to set new standards in agricultural sectors and promote long-term sustainability.\nMr Akwat Thanaprasitpattan, Minister Counsellor (Commercial) in Yangon, emphasised the importance of traceability in building international trade confidence, saying, \u201cThe introduction of a traceability system that is accessible and beneficial to all will help Myanmar\u2019s corn gain greater acceptance in the global market, particularly in markets that prioritise sustainability and transparent production practices.\u201d\nRELATED\nthailand\nC.P. Group Partners with Zhejiang University to Drive Innovation\nbusiness\nCPF profits surge by 504%  to B7.3bn in third quarter\nAdditionally, Mr Titi Lujintanon, Chief Executive Officer of CP\u2019s Feed Ingredients Business, commented, \u201cTo ensure clarity, transparency, and alignment with CP Group\u2019s sustainable development goals, the traceability system for corn used for animal feed is a vital tool that will elevate Myanmar\u2019s corn industry to meet international standards. The system requires collaboration from all sectors, especially the MCIA, as well as Myanmar traders and farmers. We are opening this system to all sectors to participate in building a sustainable corn supply chain in Myanmar led by the Myanmar people. This is a success story of the traceability system developed by CP Group and expanded through cooperation with Myanmar.\u201d\nAs a leader in agriculture, CPP (Charoen Pokphand Produce) plays a key role in promoting sustainable farming. Mr Worrasit Sithiwichai, Chief Operating Officer of Myanmar\u2019s Integrated Crop Business, noted, \u201cCPP is committed to developing a traceability system that not only helps trace the origin of corn but also supports farmers in accessing technology and environmentally friendly farming practices. We have collaborated with BKP to integrate this system into both production and marketing, enabling farmers and corn traders to effectively connect with markets in Thailand and beyond.\u201d\nCPP, a company in CP Group\u2019s Integrated Crop Business, has also been certified by Control Union, an international organisation renowned for its stringent standards in independent audits across many industries, particularly agriculture. CPP and BKP have accordingly received Control Union certification to roll out the traceability system for corn used as animal feed in Myanmar, underlining the transparency and reliability it will bring to the supply chain.\nBy enabling the corn\u2019s origin to be tracked at every step of the production process, the adoption of this system is a clear sign of the partnership\u2019s shared commitment to operating to the highest standards of sustainable agriculture. CPP and BKP are ready to expand this system to include producers, partners, and other stakeholders, aiming to elevate regional agriculture to new levels of sustainability and transparency in the immediate future.\nCP\u2019s traceability system, open to all sectors including producers, partners, farmers, and relevant organisations, utilises technology that tracks and verifies the origin of corn used for animal feed. First developed in 2023, the system incorporates blockchain technology, satellite imagery, and satellite heat detection to monitor supply chain data, from planting to export. This ensures that buyers can confidently source corn grown in safe, ethical conditions (in accordance with GEUDR 2020 standards), rather than from traditional and protected forest areas or burned cornfields.\nFurthermore, the system promotes transparency for all involved parties. MCIA (Myanmar Corn Industrial Association) will support and encourage its members, including traders and corn exporters, to participate in the system to link purchasing data from traders and farmers within the system. This will strengthen confidence in the origin of raw corn materials and raise production standards towards sustainability.\nMr U Aye Chan Aung, President of MCIA, said, \u201cWe believe that the launch of this system presents a great opportunity to clearly demonstrate the transparency of corn sourcing to buyers, thereby enhancing market confidence both domestically and internationally. MCIA is ready to advocate full cooperation from our members to encourage all farmers to join this system.\u201d\nA representative from Naung Taya village, Shan State, who participated in the project, shared their experience, saying, \u201cJoining the system was not as complicated as we had expected. The company provided guidance and technology that allowed us to farm sustainably. Our community now enjoys more stable lines of income thanks to the clearer market access we now enjoy.\u201d\nThe announcement of this collaboration under the Myanmar Corn Traceability Project has received support from various sectors, including the public sector, private companies, local farmers, and international audit organisations. The transparent and inclusive traceability system is set to become a cornerstone of efforts to bring increased sustainability and trust to Myanmar\u2019s corn industry and is expected to serve as a model for other industries to follow.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat hotel facilities are most important to you when choosing accommodation?\nSwimming pool\nFitness center\nRestaurants and bars\nMassage and spa\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nCP\nDo you like the content of this article?\n0\n2",

This conference, held at The Athenee Hotel Bangkok, was led by Mr. Anukul Peedkaew, Permanent Secretary of MSDHS, who delivered a keynote address to local and international delegates.\nThe conference serves as a platform for showcasing and exchanging best practices in urban and housing development, with a focus on low-income and slum communities. It aims to elevate MSDHS\u2019s proactive role in regional urban development, positioning Thailand as a leader in the New Urban Agenda and Sustainable Development Goal 11, specifically Target 11.1. Participants included representatives from housing and urban development organisations, community networks across the Asia-Pacific, and policymakers from government, private sector, academia, and civil society in Thailand.&nbsp;\nIn his address, Mr. Anukul stated, \u201cThis conference presents a unique opportunity to celebrate Urban October and World Cities Day on 31 October, highlighting the pivotal role of youth as change agents for sustainable, inclusive cities. Today, regional partners come together to discuss housing as a fundamental need, underpinning security and quality of life. Providing accessible housing, especially for vulnerable groups, is a core mission of MSDHS, particularly in today\u2019s VUCA (Volatile, Uncertain, Complex, and Ambiguous) world, where demographic shifts and climate change underscore the importance of housing security. The United Nations has reported that over 1.8 billion people globally lack stable housing, with rapid urbanisation challenging the Asia-Pacific region. To address this, MSDHS has launched a long-term housing policy to ensure all Thais have quality, secure housing by 2036.\u201d&nbsp;\nADVERTISEMENT\nThis conference offers an invaluable chance for knowledge exchange on urban development, housing solutions, and community resilience across nations. \u201cLet us collaborate to ensure housing security for all. I encourage all attendees to share insights and contribute towards a future where secure housing and sustainable communities are a reality for everyone,\u201d Mr. Anukul added.&nbsp;\nRELATED\nbusiness\nThai Commerce Minister leads trade mission to Kazakhstan\nbusiness\nThailand ready to start free trade negotiations with EAEU\nAdditionally, conference participants heard messages from UN-Habitat in observance of World Habitat Day and Urban October.

He said, \u201cI have always believed that libraries and books are vital for children, as they represent the future of our nation.

The economic impact is still being assessed, he said.\nIn terms of future investment to address these issues, Mr Pornchai said in fiscal 2025, there are 3,367 water management infrastructure projects with a total budget of 111 billion baht.\nThe majority of the budget, 73.1%, is for projects related to water supply and drainage infrastructure, such as sluice gates, weirs and irrigation canals.\nAnother 19.3% is allocated for embankment protection, 7.2% for water storage and new water sources, and 0.3% for water quality management.\nHowever, in terms of specific flood management projects, the budget is only 6.07 billion baht or 5.5% of the total water management budget.\nThe province receiving the most flood prevention funds is Ubon Ratchathani, with 3.42 billion baht, followed by Kanchanaburi with 2.37 billion and Bangkok 2.33 billion.\nHe said between 2015 and 2024, excluding the pandemic years of 2020-21, the government's emergency disaster relief budget averaged 5.5 billion baht per year, which is 0.18% of the average annual government expenditure. This does not include other funds allocated by the government for disaster relief efforts.\nAs the FPO oversees fiscal policies, Mr Pornchai emphasised that maintaining fiscal stability is crucial for ensuring there are sufficient funds to respond to future natural disasters.\nA medium-term fiscal plan was developed for the next four years to ensure Thailand has enough fiscal space to implement policies that address potential natural disasters.\nThe nation experienced a major flood in 2011, when a massive volume of water from the North flowed into the central region and parts of Bangkok.\nThe National Economic and Social Development Council reported the 2011 floods caused GDP growth in the fourth quarter of that year to contract by 9.0%, resulting in GDP expansion for the year of 0.1%.\nThe University of the Thai Chamber of Commerce (UTCC) estimated the damage from that flood at 156 billion baht, with most of the damage coming from the impact on manufacturing.\nA total of 930 factories in 28 provinces were affected, including several industrial estates in Ayutthaya and Pathum Thani provinces.\nBEYOND REHABILITATION\nWhile ongoing efforts to rehabilitate businesses and households affected by severe floods in the North are urgent and crucial, authorities must start thinking of better methods to deal with disasters, which are likely to become more destructive in the future, said the Federation of Thai Industries (FTI).\nThe call comes as officials are bracing for higher rainfall, runoff from the North and high tides, which threaten to inundate portions of the central region this month.\nPreventive measures are needed, as the government cannot be complacent to avoid further damage.\nOfficials should devise long-term plans to protect people against floods, said Isares Rattanadilok Na Phuket, vice-chairman of the FTI.\n\"We need better water management and a disaster warning system easily accessible by people,\" he said.\nMr Isares suggested the government develop a warning system that can provide accurate, real-time alerts via mobile phones.\nBetter risk assessment is needed for Thailand and other tropical countries as more powerful storms are expected to increase in the region, he said.\nRising temperatures in the Pacific Ocean are a key factor leading to more frequent and intense storms, according to scientists.\nThe government needs to take more serious action to cope with floods and other damage triggered by these storms, according to the FTI.\nNATIONAL AGENDA\nIdthipol Patimavirujh, managing director of Phat Food Intelligence Co Ltd, the manufacturer of Goodwill dairy products, said the company's factory is located in Saraburi province, downstream from Pa Sak Jolasid Dam, which reduces runoff and the likelihood of flooding in the lower reaches of the Pa Sak River.\nHe said he's not worried because the plant is located on high ground with low risk of flooding.\n\"The company assessed that its supply chain is still safe from the flood,\" said Mr Idthipol.\nHowever, Phat Food is monitoring the level of the river and implementing mitigation measures by setting up sandbags around the factory in case of future flooding, he said.\n\"Water resources are vital for the agricultural sector. Thailand faces two types of water problems, alternating between floods and drought, which affect the majority of the population,\" said Mr Idthipol.\nHe said the central government should order water boards and local authorities to be responsible for the management of floods within their own territory.\nDuring the severe floods in 2011, when 65 of 76 provinces were declared flood disaster zones, water management issues were set as a national agenda item, said Mr Idthipol.\nAs time passed, he said it seems the issue has gradually diminished in importance. Flooding this year again thrust water management in the spotlight, said Mr Idthipol.\n\"The same old questions remain: how can we truly solve water management and how can we store water during the rainy season to be used in the dry season?\" he said.\n\"The government should formulate a master plan on sustainable water resource management for both urgent and long-term needs, ensuring the continuity of the country's development even with future droughts and floods.\"\nBUSINESS CONTINUITY\nSanan Angubolkul, chairman of the Thai Chamber of Commerce, said in recent years Thailand has experienced frequent and severe droughts and floods, which have seemed to intensify.\nThese extreme events have caused damages to the economy, affecting agriculture, industry and community areas.\nHe said the government needs to develop a comprehensive water management plan to mitigate the impact of floods, including measures against illegal encroachment to prevent the degradation of watershed areas.\nThe chamber and the UTCC estimate the cost of flood damage in 2024 will reach 40 billion baht, said Mr Sanan.\nAs of Oct 15, the assessment found the agricultural sector has been severely affected, with damage estimated at 27.4 billion baht, followed by the service sector (9.2 billion baht) and industrial sector (287 million baht).\nAs Thailand is entering the high season for tourism, the ongoing flooding poses a significant threat to visitor revenue, he said.\nMr Sanan said the private sector needs a business continuity management plan, setting out operational policies, standards and procedures for emergencies to allow critical business functions to continue or resume within an appropriate time frame.\nLa-iad Bungsrithong, board advisor for the Thai Hotels Association, said although the authorities warned people in Chiang Mai in advance of the floods hitting the outskirts and city centre, its rapid flow was unexpected, causing households and businesses to be unprepared.\nShe said tourism operators want the government to prepare more systematic relief measures, helping people fix damage caused by the floods to restart operations in time for the high season.\nThaneth Tantipiriyakij, president of the Phuket Tourist Association, said the key obstacle in dealing with flooding is the lack of efficient water management and the imbalance between the tiny budget allotted to infrastructure development and lucrative tourism income of around 500 billion baht, which the province projects for this year.\nLIMITED IMPACT\nApisit Anantanatarat, chief executive of Bangkok Insurance (BKI), said flood damage this year is not a big concern for insurers because the flooding is happening in limited areas, with most of the damage to cars.\nBKI's initial assessment found property damage is roughly 290 million baht, with damage to cars at 50 million baht, with some of the damage being passed on to reinsurers.\nThe company estimates the floods this year are not as severe as those in 2011.\nIn addition, industrial estates have applied preventive measures such as flood walls, which have reduced the damage considerably, he said.\nWhile the floods this year are widespread in the North, Northeast and South, they did not occur at the same time.\nIn Chiang Mai, damage caused to the city centre was minimal, said Mr Apisit.\nFloods in southern areas such as Phuket, Krabi and Koh Samui have not caused much damage to houses, he said.\n\"The frequency of natural disasters has increased, so insurance companies have to be more careful in assessing the situation, and have good risk management tools to cope with them,\" said Mr Apisit.\nFor areas with frequent flooding, the liability insurance firms shoulder is limited to only 10% of the sum incurred, with the rest shared with reinsurers.\nIn low-risk areas, insurers pay up to 50% of the incurred sum.\nBKI has a team of engineers that inspect customers' properties, such as rice mills and factories.\nThe engineers inspect the strength of factory structures to assess risk and offer knowledge to factory owners, including assessing the height of the factory site to determine risk from rising water levels, he said.\n\"Natural disasters have affected the profits of insurance companies this year, but the damage is still within the expected range and insurers have profits from investments to compensate,\" said Mr Apisit.\nPROTECT YOURSELF\nIn the industrial sector, the Industrial Estate Authority of Thailand (IEAT) has reinforced the lessons of flood prevention for its industrial complexes in the central region following the massive flooding in 2011.\nThe huge volume of water ravaged factories, including those in industrial estates. Seven industrial estates in the central region suffered severe flooding that year, according to the FTI.\nAfter the 2011 disaster, the IEAT built flood walls 7-8 metres high to protect industrial estates, especially those in Ayutthaya, where Hi-Tech Industrial Estate, Bang Pa-In Industrial Estate and Nakhon Luang Industrial Estate are located.\nThese estates should not face severe flooding caused by runoff this year, said Sumet Thangprasert, acting governor of the IEAT.\n\"We also dredged canals near the industrial estates, prepared pumps and discussed plans to protect communities located nearby,\" he said.\nMr Isares of the FTI expressed concern over light industries, including farm produce and food processing, as they are usually not in industrial estates.\nMany factories in these groups were already affected by floods and mudslides, he said, damaging their machinery and electrical systems.\nDAMAGED CARS\nAccording to new criteria from the Office of the Insurance Commission (OIC), insurance companies are required to pay for flood damage caused to cars at five different levels, starting from 8,000 baht.\nIf the repair costs exceed 70% of the current car price, insurers must pay the full amount as specified in the policy.\nMost first-class insurance coverage is calculated based on the current car price, while second- and third-class coverage is fixed and can be selected before a policy is purchased, such as 100,000 baht or 200,000 baht.\nKananusorn Theingthrakool, senior director of the Benefit Protection Department at the OIC, said paying damages for cars impaired by flooding is not required by law, but the regulator did request cooperation from insurers on speedily addressing claims.\nThe OIC coordinated with the Thai General Insurance Association, asking it to compile a list of flood damage from all insurance companies for the regulator to inspect, he said.\nChildren play in their flooded neighbourhood in tambon Tha-it of Nonthaburi, attributed to runoff from the Chao Phraya River and high tides.

A major rice producer in the world, Thailand faces environmental challenges. Traditional rice farming methods contribute significantly to greenhouse gas emissions, with water consumption and methane emissions being the main reasons.&nbsp;\nADVERTISEMENT\nExpert Insights: Solutions to Transform Agriculture\nPeter Bracher, an expert in sustainable agriculture, and Suchanya Poothong, a leader in environmentally friendly agriculture, discussed the importance of immediate action in Thailand's rice industry.&nbsp;\nBeggars arrested on Sukhumvit with B300,000 cash, B1m in bank account\nEx-minister\u2019s father held in murder of adopted son\nFresh storm alert for southern Thailand\nMr Peter Bracher introduced Alternative Wetting and Drying (AWD), a water management technique that reduces methane emissions while maintaining rice yields. While Ms Sunchanya Poothong emphasised the social and economic benefits of low-carbon rice, particularly for smallholder farmers, and encouraged students, farmers, and communities to adopt more environmentally friendly practices.\nStudents taking the lead to create awareness:\nThis seminar organised by students from Ruamrudee International School and Bangkok Patana School aimed to educate young leaders on sustainable rice production. The event highlighted the importance of young people in promoting sustainability. The founder of the \"Future of Good Life\" project, Marc Sithsakorn Jantrakul, emphasised the need to educate farmers and young people on sustainable rice production methods for a better future for agriculture and the environment in Thailand.\nInteractive discussion: real-world impact&nbsp;\nThe seminar on low-carbon agriculture was successful, with participants discussing challenges and opportunities. Students and farmers shared their perspectives, leading to new ideas for implementing these practices on a larger scale. The seminar ended with a call to action, encouraging participants to apply their knowledge.\n&nbsp;The success of the seminar was just the beginning. The Future of Good Life team plans to expand its reach and educate more schools and communities about low-carbon agriculture. They are also exploring partnerships with local governments and agricultural organisations to expand the use of sustainable practices.&nbsp;\nMarc Sithsakorn Jantrakul says:&nbsp;\"This seminar may be over, but our work is just beginning.

This marks a continuation of the mission to inspire real action through collaboration across all sectors, as 'sustainability is a shared responsibility for everyone.'\nSpeaking at the \u2018SX Launching Forward: SX 2025' session at SX Grand Plenary Hall, G Floor, the Queen Sirikit National Convention Center (QSNCC), Mr Thapana emphasised the goal of expanding partnerships with networks in all sectors. He also outlined plans to intensify activities across the five core zones\u2014SEP Inspiration, Better Me, Better Community, Better Living, and Better World\u2014over the 10-day event. The aim is to motivate everyone to take meaningful action for a sustainable future and invite them to become 'SX Shapers,' the agents of this change.\nRELATED\nlife\nPhoto exhibit celebrates a special friendship\nthailand\nThe World Bank Promotes ESG Sustainability at SX Sustainability Expo 2024\nThe Sustainability Expo (SX) , is the largest sustainability event in ASEAN, launched in 2020 by the combined efforts of five major business organisations within the Thailand Supply Chain Network (TSCN) including Frasers Property (Thailand) Public Company Limited, PTT Public Company Limited, SCG, Thai Beverage Public Company Limited, and Thai Union Group Public Company Limited, SX will be held annually until 2030, aligning with the United Nations\u2019 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the \u2018Decade of Action\u2019 to meet 17 global goals across five areas: People, Prosperity, Planet, Peace, and Partnership.\nBuilding a Sustainable Future Starts with Individual Action and Collective Collaboration\n\u201cSustainability often makes us think of global concerns, but it ultimately starts with individuals. Achieving Net Zero Carbon Emissions requires collective effort from all\u2014countries, organisations, public and private sectors, and consumers alike. The real question is, how can we collaborate to build a truly sustainable world? As we consume the Earth\u2019s natural resources, it\u2019s our duty to restore its richness for future generations,\u201d Mr Thapana explained.\nThe SX continues to embody the concept of 'Sufficiency for Sustainability,' promoting awareness of balance and moderation by following the guiding principles of H.M. King Maha Vajiralongkorn and the philosophy of the Sufficiency Economy introduced by His Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej The Great.\n\u201cIn today\u2019s business landscape, extremism is common. Consumers want the best products at the lowest prices, and we live in a consumer-driven world. The challenge is finding a way to co-exist while creating a sustainable future,\u201d he reflected.\nMr Thapana also affirmed that the event will continue through 2030, in alignment with the UN\u2019s Decade of Action, with the hope that the youth will drive the future of sustainability. SX represents a shared vision for a brighter future, and in 2025, the event will return with more dynamic activities and deeper engagement.\n\"I would like to thank all the representatives and participants for coming together today. Let\u2019s take this opportunity to learn and be part of building a sustainable future together. See you at SX 2025 at the Queen Sirikit National Convention Center,\" Mr Thapana concluded.\nMs Tongjai Thanachanan, Director of SX 2024\nMs Tongjai Thanachanan, Director of SX 2024, also reflected on this year\u2019s achievements, noting the expansion to a 10-day event covering 70,000 square metres. Now in its fifth year, SX 2024 surpassed expectations with over 700,000 attendees, including 227,452 youths aged 18-35, surpassing the original target of 500,000 participants. The SX 2024 application also recorded over 200,000 downloads.\nBeyond impressive attendance figures, SX 2024 featured more than 700 speakers and contributors who shared their expertise on sustainability, representing over 270 organisations. The event maintained its B2C2B (Business-to-Consumer-to-Business) model, encouraging consumers to adopt more sustainable habits.\nSX 2024 Drives 40 Million THB in Revenue and Strengthens Global Collaboration for Sustainability\nThroughout the 10-day expo, the SX Marketplace and SX Food Festival generated over 40 million THB in revenue for local communities and entrepreneurs. This included nearly 24 million THB from the Food Festival and over 17 million THB from the SX Marketplace, where booth space was provided free of charge.\nIn response to severe flooding in Northern Thailand, two benefit concerts were held on September 28 and October 5, raising 4.8 million THB for flood relief efforts. Media partnerships were vital in amplifying the event\u2019s impact, with over 3 million views on social media, 8 million views through online media partners, and 9.2 million views on television.\nMs Tongjai also highlighted SX\u2019s five-year track record of success saying that \u201cOver the past five years, more than 1.2 million people have engaged with sustainability themes through SX, generating over 100 million THB for local communities. The SX Market Place alone raised 18 million THB from 281 vendors. In the SX REPARTMENTSTORE, more than 4,000 donated items were sold, raising 80,000 THB. We also collected 7,146 kilogrammes of recyclable materials, including PET bottles, glass bottles, aluminum cans, and cardboard boxes, along with 5,600 kilogrammes of food waste, which helped reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 26 tonnes of CO2 equivalent.\u201d\nMs Tongjai added that \u201cIn addition to these milestones, we have strengthened frameworks for collaboration both locally and internationally. This year, over 20 international organisations participated in exhibitions. We have seen clearer, more practical examples of B2C2B (Business-to-Consumer-to-Business) collaboration, such as the partner practice declarations from the Thailand Supply Chain Network (TSCN) and the presentation of the SX TSCN Sustainability Award to 48 partners working on sustainability initiatives with TSCN co-founders. These projects produced measurable outcomes in both social and environmental dimensions. Our network partners, SCG and the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment, also returned to co-host major events like the ESG Symposium 2024 and the Thailand Climate Action Conference (TCAC) 2024, further establishing SX as a central platform for sustainability and a key learning space for organisations and educational institutions alike.\u201d\nShe also attributed the event\u2019s success to strong collaborations between the public and private sectors, as well as the support of all participants.\n\u201cThis success is a proud milestone in driving Thailand\u2019s economy forward, particularly in terms of sustainability. We look forward to welcoming everyone to Sustainability Expo 2025 or SX 2025,\u201d Ms Tongjai amplified.\nStay connected with ongoing sustainability activities and projects at\nsustainabilityexpo.com\nand on Facebook or Line Official Account: SX Official.\nwww.sustainabilityexpo.com\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nIf you were to buy real estate in Thailand outside of Bangkok, which area would be your top choice?\nChiang Mai\nPhuket\nPattaya\nKhao Yai\nKoh Samui\nHua Hin\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nSX 2024\nDo you like the content of this article?\n0\n0",

Right from the beginning, our vision has been to develop Thai brands and designers and empower them with knowledge and skills to build their own businesses. To this end, we have collaborated with both public and private organizations, as well as leading global brands, to create a knowledge base for Thai fashion development as well as provide platforms for showcasing work and retail spaces in our shopping centers, thus creating a comprehensive ecosystem for the Thai fashion\nindustry.This\necosystem has launched hundreds of leading Thai brands, from top-tier to emerging Thai designers and transformed the creativity and innovation of university students into&nbsp;sustainable businesses.

They noted that top-tier brands emphasise inheritance values, where rarity, premium quality, and timeless designs are passed on to future generations.

The omnichannel approach has streamlined shopping experiences and created opportunities for new brands to rise.

Held on the 4th floor, Zone D, the event saw a tremendous turnout from MBK employees, store owners, and customers, all eager to contribute to life-saving causes. A total of 144 units of blood were collected, and 58 participants pledged to donate their eyes, organs, and bodies, highlighting the community's commitment to making a meaningful impact through this quarterly initiative.\nMiss Sattakamol Worakul, Senior Director of Corporate Communications at Intelligent Creative and Marketing Co., Ltd., represented MBK Center's management team in welcoming the doctors, nurses, and staff from the National Blood Centre and the Thai Red Cross Organ Donation Centre. She also donated blood herself and said, \u201cMBK Center is committed to caring for society and the surrounding community, fostering a compassionate society and improving the quality of life for Thais. Under the MBK CARE concept, we organise the \"One Person Gives, Many Receive\" blood, organ, and eye donation event in collaboration with the Thai Red Cross four times a year to facilitate those who wish to donate blood. The next event will be on Thursday, December 20, 2024. I would like to invite everyone to join this great act of charity by giving life through blood, organ, and eye donation.\u201d\nMiss Sahubphak Chokvijitkul, Managing Director of MBK Center, said, \u201cToday, I came to donate organs and eyes with the Thai Red Cross Organ Donation Centre. I\u2019ve been meaning to donate for a long time but hadn\u2019t had the chance to visit the Thai Red Cross Society. This event at MBK Center was a great opportunity. Organ donation after death benefits medical students, and the organs can save other lives. Blood donation is also a great event, with many customers showing interest. The shop owners here often don\u2019t have time to visit the Thai Red Cross Society, so this event makes it convenient for both tenants and customers.\u201d\nADVERTISEMENT\nMr Veerawit, aged 68, shared, \u201cI came here today to browse for mobile phones and happened to see the organ and eye donation activity by the Thai Red Cross Society, so I inquired. I had donated my body to Phramongkutklao Hospital nearly 30 years ago and found out that I could also donate organs and eyes, so I did. I\u2019m a teacher by profession, and before becoming one, I vowed to be a teacher both in life and in death, so that my body would still be useful after I\u2019m gone. I\u2019ve also donated blood 70 times, initially four times a year, but after turning 65, I can donate only twice a year. I plan to continue as long as I can. Donating blood fills my heart with immense joy. It\u2019s a way to help others, and one blood donation can save three lives.\u201d\nMiss Tipsukon Kanponpai, a volunteer staff member at MBK, said, \u201cThis is my 40th time donating blood. I usually donate at the Thai Red Cross Society and MBK Center. The blood donation program is great and easy to participate in. One person really does give, and many people receive. My father is a regular donor, and that inspired me to do the same. In the future, it would be even better if MBK Center could have a dedicated blood donation room, so customers who come to the Center can donate blood immediately.\u201d\nRELATED\nThroughout this year, MBK Center, in collaboration with business groups in the Pathumwan and Ratchaprasong areas, has organised volunteer activities to donate blood to the National Blood Centre of the Thai Red Cross Society in honour of His Majesty the King on the auspicious occasion of his 72nd birthday. The next blood donation event at MBK Center will be held on Thursday, December 26, 2024, on the 4th floor, Zone D.\nFor more information, please contact MBK Contact Center at 1285, or follow MBK Center's activities and promotions at\nhttps://mbk-center.co.th\n/ or on the Facebook page mbkcenterth and Instagram mbkcenter.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat is your budget range for purchasing a condominium?\nEkkamai-Thong Lor\nSathorn-Silom\nChidlom-Siam\nBang Na\nChinatown\nAri\nRiverside\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nDo you like the content of this article?\n0\n0\nCOMMENT",

(Reuters photo)\nMore than 180 years of horse racing came to an end in Singapore on Saturday, as the Singapore Turf Club hosted its final race day before its track is handed back to the government to provide land for new homes.\nUnder an overcast sky, the air-conditioned VIP boxes were full of enthusiasts, socialites and expats, while the grounds and betting halls below hosted mostly older-generation punters. The sun broke through for the last race, the last-ever Grand Singapore Gold Cup. &nbsp;\nThe winner, South African jockey Muzi Yeni, echoed a feeling of loss shared by many on the day. \u201cI\u2019d like the government to look at it, if I have much say,\u201d he said in a post-race interview.\nADVERTISEMENT\nAds powered by\nThe site of more than 120 hectares (300 acres) is to be bulldozed for new public and private homes as the nation, smaller than New York City, tries to accommodate a growing population that crossed six million this year. The government has said that this is necessary to ensure \u201cthere is sufficient land for future generations\u201d. After some preparation work, the site must be returned by early 2027.\nWhile the decision to end horse racing in the city sent shock waves through the riding and training community when it was announced last year, the sport was already in decline. Spectatorship fell from a race-day average of 11,000 in 2010 to about 6,000 in 2019, before Covid cut attendance by more than half. On Saturday, about 10,000 turned up \u2014 a third of the stadium\u2019s capacity.\nRELATED\nbusiness\nNew business registrations set to top 90,000 this year\nbusiness\nThe investment lure of printed circuit boards\nYounger citizens have migrated to other sports and pastimes. Racing in the city is now dominated by the annual Formula 1 motor race, which in September attracted nearly 270,000 people to its three-day spectacle and concerts.\nHorse racing on the island has always had to contend with the need for land. The&nbsp;Singapore&nbsp;Sporting Club, founded by Scottish merchant William Henry Macleod Read, held its first competition at Farrer Road, north of the city center, in 1843, when the country was a British colony. The event was such an occasion that it was declared a public holiday.\nIn 1911, the first flight from&nbsp;Singapore, piloted by Belgian aviator Joseph Christiaens, took off from the course, one of the few available areas of flat open land.&nbsp;\nRubber plantation\nAs the city grew and interest in the sport increased, the renamed&nbsp;Singapore&nbsp;Turf Club moved to a site further out after purchasing the Bukit Timah Rubber Estate. The new track opened in 1933 and remained the home of the club until 1999, when it was repurposed for other recreational sports. It has since been earmarked for more homes.&nbsp;\nHorse racing isn\u2019t the only sport to succumb to the housing expansion. The last 18-hole public golf course closed earlier this year for redevelopment.\nThe Turf Club\u2019s final home was built as a S$500 million ($384 million) state-of-the art facility, with air-conditioned booths, floodlighting for night races and a grandstand capable of hosting 30,000 spectators.\n\u201cSingapore&nbsp;was a world leader in horse racing\u201d and the track was one of the best, said Tim Fitzsimmons, head trainer and director of Fitzsimmons Racing, who had more than 50 horses last year and is relocating back to Australia after coming to&nbsp;Singapore&nbsp;in 2007. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019ll ever come back.\u201d\nMany of the thousands who made the trip on Saturday were pensioners who had been coming to the races for decades. Chain-smoking punters cheering on the thoroughbreds, a wheelchair-bound woman chatting with her friends in a Chinese dialect, balding men scrutinising crumpled sheets of newspaper for details on the horses: All gathered for this last hurrah.\n\u201cIt is a nice and scenic place, but its glory days are over and it is too expensive to upkeep,\u201d said Song Ya Jing, a 77-year-old part-time cook who was accompanying her husband for a last series of bets. \u201cMaybe my children can live in the public housing one day.\u201d\nAt the end of the day, a brief video montage on the main screen and small pyrotechnic display brought a modest end to nearly two centuries of horse racing in&nbsp;Singapore. Most of the audience was gone before the sun set below the 41 towering light masts.&nbsp;\nAs the last stragglers took pictures amid discarded betting tickets, the screen flashed its final message: \u201cTHANK YOU.\u201d\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat is your preferred price range per night for accommodation in Bangkok?\n1,000 - 3,000 THB\n3,000 - 5,000 THB\n5,000 - 8,000 THB\nOver 8,000 THB\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nSingapore\nHorse\nRacing\nTurf club\nHousing\nDo you like the content of this article?\n27\n17\nCOMMENT\n(6)",

Held late last month across various locations including Songkhla Old Town, Samila Beach, Hat Yai and Pattani province, this year's event was more than just a festival -- it was a call to action.\nUnder the theme \"The South's Turn!\", the festival aimed to highlight the unique cultural assets and talents of the South, sparking a creative renaissance that not only energised the local economy but also improved the quality of life for its communities.\nOne of the most talked-about events at this year's festival was the Microwave Film Festival, which captivated audiences with its dynamic programming and innovative approach to cinema. Curated by Chaiyapruek Chalermpornpanit, a seasoned director of photography with decades of experience, the Microwave Film Festival was conceived as a platform to connect filmmakers from various backgrounds, both established and emerging, mainstream and independent.\nADVERTISEMENT\nChaiyapruek, who also serves as a special lecturer in film at Silpakorn and Chulalongkorn universities, emphasised the importance of bridging the gap between different generations of filmmakers.\nCreative Economy Agency (CEA)\n\"I've been involved in the Thai film industry for over a decade, from directing and producing films to teaching about film,\" Chaiyapruek shared. \"I realised that my work has always been about elevating the film industry and connecting the old with the new. That's what led to the creation of Microwave Film Festival -- a dream festival where filmmakers of all frequencies can come together to learn, share and grow.\"\nThe festival's name, Microwave Film Festival, is fitting given its mission to rapidly heat up and expand the film industry in Thailand. With a strong belief that the Thai film industry has the potential to challenge global trends, the festival provides a space where filmmakers of all kinds can come together, clash creatively and spark new ideas.\n\"We wanted to make a film festival that isn't just for filmmakers, but also an interesting festival for creative people in all fields. This is the DNA of our festival,\" Chaiyapruek pointed out.\nMicrowave Film Festival's line-up was diverse and engaging, featuring seven main activities designed to appeal to a wide range of interests. The screenings showcased a variety of films across different genres, including 20 high-quality short films from new graduates nationwide. The festival also offered classes to enhance the skills of budding filmmakers, going beyond the classroom to provide hands-on learning experiences.\n\"It's about more than just watching films,\" Chaiyapruek noted. \"It's about learning the craft, understanding the industry and pushing boundaries.\"\nMicrowave Film Festival curator Chaiyapruek Chalermpornpanit. Creative Economy Agency (CEA)\nIn addition to classes, the festival hosted conversations that delved into the intricacies of the film industry and beyond, revealing lesser-known insights and sparking meaningful discussions. Networking events connected filmmakers from across Thailand, fostering collaborations and encouraging the exchange of ideas.\nOne of the most unique aspects of the festival was the \"Living Cinema\", a series of live performances that blurred the lines between real life and cinema, creating immersive experiences that captivated audiences.\n\"We wanted to create a space where real life and cinema could intersect in unexpected ways,\" Chaiyapruek said.\nAnother innovative element of the festival was \"Living Dialogue\", an exhibition of southern Thai film scripts that sparked conversations about the region's unique storytelling traditions. The \"Sound &amp; Sight Seeing\" tours offered attendees a chance to explore the city through the eyes of filmmakers, gaining a deeper understanding of how environment and culture shape cinematic narratives.\nAmong the festival's many highlights, one that stood out was the debut of Dhutanga Cinema, a travelling movie theatre designed to bring films to communities everywhere. Created by Made By Lert, a Chiang Mai-based furniture design studio, Dhutanga Cinema is a 25-seat, mobile, modular cinema that can be easily assembled and disassembled, making it perfect for reaching remote areas that lack access to traditional cinemas.\nMovie posters for short films by new university graduates. Creative Economy Agency (CEA)\nThe concept behind Dhutanga Cinema was inspired by the idea of a dhutanga -- a Pali term for pilgrimage. This cinema on the move aims to screen a diverse range of films, both mainstream and independent, while also serving as a space for workshops and the exchange of ideas.\nChief designer Navarat Techaratanaprasert of Made By Lert explained the inspiration behind the project: \"The core of our design philosophy is versatility. All the furniture we create can be disassembled, reassembled and transformed. We love films and art, so we wanted to take this concept and expand it into a larger space. That's how Dhutanga Cinema was born.\"\nDhutanga Cinema's design reflects a deep commitment to sustainability and local craftsmanship. Constructed using materials sourced from the South, the cinema is adorned with handcrafted decorations unique to each area it visits, making each screening a celebration of local culture.\nNavarat elaborated on the design process: \"We wanted to create a space that feels intimate and special, where people can enjoy a high-quality cinematic experience, no matter where they are. This project is like an updated version of the outdoor cinema we all remember from the past, but with modern amenities and a focus on community engagement.\"\nThe mobile cinema is equipped with a high-quality visual and sound system, comparable to that of a standard multiplex cinema, ensuring that audiences have an exceptional viewing experience.\nThe mobile Dhutanga Cinema from Made By Lert. Creative Economy Agency (CEA)\n\"We wanted to provide the same quality of sight and sound as multiplex cinemas in shopping centres, but in a format that's accessible and mobile,\" Navarat said. \"It's about bringing cinema to people, rather than making them come to us.\"\nDhutanga Cinema isn't just about screening films -- it's about creating a space where people can come together to share stories, ideas and experiences. The cinema's flexible design allows it to transform into a workshop space, fostering creativity and encouraging dialogue between local communities and younger generations.\n\"Beyond screening films, we see Dhutanga Cinema as a tool for cultural exchange and education,\" Navarat explained. \"It's a place where people can learn from each other and grow together.\"\nReflecting on the future of Dhutanga Cinema, Navarat expressed hope that the project will continue to evolve and reach more communities across Thailand.\n\"We want it to be more than just a cinema,\" he said. \"We want it to be a platform for creativity, a space where people can come together to watch films, share ideas, and celebrate the magic of storytelling. The heart of making this cinema lies in the people, the sounds, the visuals, the craftsmanship -- it's all about the collective experience.\"\nAs Pakk Taii Design Week 2024 came to a close, the success of the Microwave Film Festival and Dhutanga Cinema underscored the power of creativity and community in shaping the future of southern Thailand. The festival not only showcased the region's rich cultural heritage but also highlighted the potential for innovation and collaboration to drive social and economic change.\nA talk at Microwave Film Festival. Creative Economy Agency (CEA)\nChaiyapruek Chalermpornpanit's vision for the Microwave Film Festival, combined with Navarat Techaratanaprasert's innovative design of Dhutanga Cinema, exemplifies how art and design can come together to create meaningful experiences that resonate with people from all walks of life.\nAs Chaiyapruek aptly put it: \"Our goal is to create a festival that's not just about films, but about bringing people together, inspiring creativity and celebrating the beauty of our shared stories.\"\nLooking ahead, the legacy of Pakk Taii Design Week 2024 will continue to inspire and energise the creative community in southern Thailand, paving the way for future festivals that build on this year's successes and explore new frontiers in art, culture, and innovation.\nAs Navarat reflected: \"The journey of Dhutanga Cinema is just beginning. We're excited to see where it takes us and the communities we serve. This is just the start of something truly special.\"\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat type of hotel location do you prefer in Thailand?\nBeachfront resorts\nCity-center hotels (close to shopping, restaurants, attractions\nSecluded, nature retreats\nNear airports for convenience\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nDo you like the content of this article?\n0\n0\nCOMMENT",

Its Hinghoi Project, now in its eighth year, has been presented with the AREA Awards 2024 (Asia Responsible Enterprise Awards) \u2013 the third consecutive year the project has been awarded the accolade for Social Empowerment by Enterprise Asia, a leading non-government organisation that promotes responsible enterprises in Asia.&nbsp;&nbsp;\nThis achievement is a testament to the company's commitment to leveraging its people's capabilities for social and community development. It aligns with CKPower's CSR Strategy Framework 2022\u20132026, which includes success indicators for the Hinghoi Project. The framework aims to continuously increase community access to renewable energy, in line with the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals. &nbsp;&nbsp;\nMr Thanawat Trivisvavet, Managing Director of CKPower Public Company Limited\n,\nsaid, \u201cWe are committed to leveraging our clean energy engineering capabilities to support local communities and society. This effort aligns with our CSR Strategy Framework 2022\u20132026 and contributes to the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We have consistently improved and cared for the local communities around our power plants. Our Hinghoi Project, now in its eighth year, has made a positive impact on society in multiple ways. It has increased community access to renewable energy by up to 40,330 watts. Additionally, it has enhanced knowledge of renewable energy for 4,030 leadership teachers and youths. The project has also educated 1,272 people about natural resources and environmental protection. Through these efforts, we are making steady progress in our plan to sustainably improve society's quality of life.\u201d&nbsp;\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe Hinghoi Project by CKPower began in 2016. It was a collaboration of CKPower\u2019s employees, local communities and networks to leverage the know-how and expertise in power production engineering of the company\u2019s personnel to develop society and local communities, especially in solving power shortages. The Hinghoi Project, in its eighth year, recently supported the development of the Ban Mae Mu Nai Border Patrol Police Learning Centre under CKPower\u2019s patronage, where the company led its engineers and staff to design and construct a library in the form of an energy-saving building to reduce power consumption while using locally sourced materials in harmony with the local landscape for ease of future maintenance. There are plans for CKPower\u2019s employees to improve the landscape and decorate the library with a renewable energy theme, while encouraging children and youth to learn and understand renewable energy as well as to lead sustainable lives.&nbsp;\nCKPower's commitment through the Hinghoi Project illustrates the company\u2019s social empowerment capabilities in the four aspects evaluated by Enterprise Asia: 1) the project has leveraged the principal engineering capabilities of the organisation to develop society and local communities with far-reaching positive impact within the company\u2019s CSR Strategy Framework (Competency, Co-Creation, Cooperation, Connection); 2) the project has produced generations of leadership teachers and clean energy students to ensure sustainable renewable energy development; 3) the project has clear goals and measurable results and has consistently been executed to achieve these goals; 4) the project exemplifies sustainable development by setting up a renewable energy fund, ensuring each community has the resources to maintain company-provided equipment and to consistently follow up on what has been done. As a result, CKPower has been awarded the AREA Awards 2024 for Social Empowerment for the third consecutive year. This recognition underscores the company's ongoing commitment to social responsibility and community development.&nbsp;\nMr Thanawat added: \u201cWinning the AREA Award 2024 is a success and a testament to CKPower\u2019s intention to take care of society and local communities. We consistently follow up on the Hinghoi Project, now in its eighth year, as well as other initiatives under the Hinghoi Project\u2019s mission, such as the Empowering Kids for a Sustainable World project. This model project fulfils the need for renewable energy through solar panel installations and a renewable energy fund for schools and communities around our power plants. The initiative helps save money on electricity bills for Pakthongchai Chunhawan Wittayakarn School near the Bangkhenchai Solar Power Plant in Nakhon Ratchasima, and Udomseel Witthaya School near the Bangpa-in Cogeneration Power Plant in Ayutthaya. It also makes children and youth leaders more knowledgeable with a better understanding of renewable energy as part of our effort to pass on this knowledge to the communities around the schools, helping to build on and fulfil the goals of the Hinghoi Project in providing widespread access to renewable energy for society and local communities. Under this initiative, CKPower\u2019s volunteers have worked together to design teaching methods for over 200 renewable energy youths at the two local schools so they can pass on knowledge about renewable energy, and the protection and rehabilitation of natural resources and the environment.\u201d&nbsp;\nThe Hinghoi Project, through which CKPower has leveraged its power production engineering expertise to benefit society. The recent activity was held at the Baan Mae Mu Nai Border Patrol Police Learning Centre under CKPower\u2019s patronage in Chiang Mai, aiming to educate children and youth about renewable energy and support their sustainable quality of life.\nFor the next step, CKPower will continue the Hinghoi Project to achieve its CSR Strategy Framework goals by 2026. This will involve creating shared social value in collaboration with all power plants in Thailand and the Lao PDR to ensure sustainable project development. The initiative will also promote access to renewable energy to improve quality of life, establish renewable energy funds to support sustainable livelihoods, and expand the network of renewable energy leadership teachers and youth for a far-reaching positive impact.&nbsp;&nbsp;\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhich app or platform do you usually use to book accommodations?\nBooking.com\nAgoda\nAirbnb\nTrip.com\nTraveloka\nExpedia\nSkyscanner\nDirectly with the accommodation\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nDo you like the content of this article?\n1\n1\nCOMMENT",

Throughout her career at the e-commerce company, she has served as senior vice-president for performance marketing, senior vice-president and category director of fashion, and chief operating officer, before being appointed to chief executive earlier this year.&nbsp;\nHaving a strong and supportive mother as her first female role model, Ms Varitha &nbsp;grew up with deeply rooted values that served her well when she studied at the London School of Economics, living independently from her family at the young age of 16. Her razor-sharp focus allowed her to thrive academically while also taking on a range of leadership roles within the school and local community.\nRELATED\nbusiness\nLazTravel posts hefty growth each quarter\nbusiness\nLazada chief set for exit\nAfter graduation, her tenacity and drive powered her career trajectory, from her time in investment banking in the UK to finally deciding to return home to Bangkok to be closer to her family.\n\"After returning to Bangkok, I spent some time at an NGO with the goal of uplifting the overall education standards in Thailand. It was during my stint there that I gleaned more about my personal motivations and what I want to do next. I realized that I thrive on challenges and want to work on things that deliver real social impact.\"\n\"When I learnt about the opportunity at Lazada, I immediately saw the opportunity for me to play an active role to bolster the local SME community and help them leverage the digital economy for success.\"\nOne memorable moment she recalled was being part of the team that rolled out Lazada's first 11.11 mega shopping campaign in Southeast Asia \u2013the first double-date sales event by an e-commerce player in the region.\nAt that time, e-commerce was still in its infancy, so tremendous effort was required to prepare for the campaign from a marketing, technology, infrastructure and commercial perspective. The campaign also highlighted the need to create greater awareness and engagement among buyers and readiness among sellers.\n\"I gained significant hands-on operational experience during my past roles at Lazada, where I recognised the dynamic needs of our buyers and sellers, identified opportunities to provide them with the best possible experience, and worked with my team to deliver at speed and scale,\" she said.&nbsp;\nMs Varitha added that her hands-on experience helped her understand how Lazada operates and to connect the dots from both a business and people management perspective, enabling her to help the organization improve working processes and create long-term value.&nbsp;\nHer young age also allowed her to understand and connect well with Lazada Thailand's team members, whose average age is only around 27. This helps her foster a shared vision and a clear direction with her teams.&nbsp;\nHer ability to roll up her sleeves and keep ears to the ground allows her to stay close to the core business operations. \"I believe in people. When talented people are inspired and empowered, they can deliver the best work of their lives,\" &nbsp;Ms Varitha elaborated. \" By reaching out directly to work with employees across different teams and seniority, I was able to gain deeper insights into the business, while also acting as a mentor or big sister to support their personal aspirations and growth.\"\n\"Honestly, my career progress has been aided tremendously by Lazada's culture of diversity and how it creates opportunities, empowerment and ownership for all teams. The company also supports staff's career development through their life moments, such as providing opportunities for those returning from maternity leave to raise their hands for key projects. In my case, shortly after returning from my maternity leave, I was appointed to the Thailand CEO role. With such a culture, Lazadians are highly motivated to come up with new ideas and move things quickly,\" Ms Varitha said.\n\"I am proud to see my teams' development and growth from those early days, and to see Lazada emerge as a key training ground for talent in the technology industry,\" said Ms Varitha.&nbsp;\nWHAT GROWTH LOOKS LIKE AT LAZADA\nUnleashing the Power of Growth\nMs Varitha recognized the positive impact of Lazada on Thailand's small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), including account managers working closely with local merchants until they are finally ready to launch new products online, with several Thai brands making it to the top 10 brand rankings during the company's mega campaign events.\n\"We have stood alongside Thai SMEs through times of growth and adversity. During Covid-19, I was greatly touched to receive a note from one local SME thanking our platform for providing him with a channel through which to sell his goods to support his business and family during those difficult times,\" she said. &nbsp;\nMs Varitha shared that the dynamic evolution of e-commerce over the past 12 years calls for continuous self-development and rapid market innovations.&nbsp;\n\"My goal as Thailand CEO is to inspire and empower my teams as much as possible, support continuous improvement for us to better meet the needs of customers and sellers, and together drive Thailand's digital economy,\" said Ms Varitha.&nbsp;\nTRANSFORMING FOR THE FUTURE\nEarlier this year, Lazada underwent a transformation with the primary goal of creating an organization that is more ready for the future digital economy.&nbsp;\nMs Varitha said that the aim is also to boost the company's agility and speed and leverage the infrastructure technology of parent company Alibaba to deliver new features that better respond to customer and seller needs.&nbsp;\n\"With a more nimble and flexible organisational structure and by working closely with regional teams and Alibaba, we can leverage a wider technological infrastructure, deepening synergy and sharing market insights to achieve better business outcomes and long-term growth.\"&nbsp;\nLazada's embrace of Alibaba's artificial intelligence (AI) technology, from product search to personalisation, aims to improve and serve customer experience and also brings tools to sellers, such as real-time business sales analysis.\n\"Our AI-driven technology can automatically generate promotional banners for the sellers' storefronts based on their product text descriptions, making it easier to sell their products,\" Ms Varitha added.&nbsp;\nCUSTOMER-FIRST APPROACH&nbsp;\n\"Our mission is to maintain our leadership in the e-commerce sector. Our focus remains on our core strengths as an e-commerce platform, not emerging channels like social commerce,\" Ms Varitha noted.&nbsp;\nLazada will ensure a wide variety of product assortment and complete product offerings and LazMall will continue to be a strong channel for responding to the market with leading global and local brands that offer authentic, high-quality products, and the best shopping experience, she said.&nbsp;\n\"In the fourth quarter of this year, we will introduce more exclusive global brands to our LazMall,\" she added.&nbsp;\nShe said her priority is to lead the team to align with the company's direction and growth vision.\n\"With a customer-first approach, the team needs to have an in-depth understanding of what customers are looking for, adapt to changes, and connect the dots to reduce customers' pain points,\" she said.&nbsp;\nMs Varitha said that in the early days of e-commerce, where there was some lack of trust in online products, Lazada was a pioneer, offering the cash-on-delivery payment method to shoppers.&nbsp;\nThe company offers a faster refund if buyers are not satisfied with the products they receive. Lazada also offers a free pick-up of returned products at the customer's home, or a preferred drop-off point to make it easier to return products.\n\"We've also extended the refund period from 15 to 30 days, an approach that works well with fashion products,\" she added.\nELEVATING THE EXPERIENCE\nMs Varitha said Lazada is a pioneer in bringing new features to enhance the shopping experience. These include a \"Put in My Home\" feature that allows prospective buyers to assess how furniture items fit in their homes virtually, making it easier for them to make purchasing decisions.\nAnother feature is \"Virtual Try-On\", which is based on augmented reality technology that enables shoppers to virtually try on different lipstick colors.&nbsp;\n\"We will extend this [virtual try-on] technology to the fashion category,\" Ms Varitha said.\nThe company is also developing a concierge-like service for frequent shoppers as part of the move to upgrade its customer support service.\nShe said that in the company's customer satisfaction survey, the three factors that make shoppers choose Lazada are value for money, including low-price guarantee, fast delivery with 90% of orders delivered the next day, and faster refunds.&nbsp;\n\"In some cases, if shoppers initiate a refund, we return their money even before the product is returned,\" she added. &nbsp;&nbsp;\nShe sees Thailand's e-commerce as continuing to grow even amid economic challenges. According to a Google, Temasek and Bain &amp; Co study, the value of the market is expected to maintain 16% growth, reaching US$30 billion, or over 1 trillion baht, by 2025. &nbsp;\nMoreover, households with a high level of income are expected to fuel the growth of e-commerce over the next five years.&nbsp;\nA Euromonitor report projects the continuous growth of Thai consumers, based on the upper-middle income ($10,000-25,000 per year) and high income (more than $25,000 per year) categories.&nbsp;\nEMPOWERING LOCAL SELLERS\nLazada also focuses on broadening opportunities for local businesses. In addition to selling products, it has added flight and accommodation booking services to its platform.\nMs Varitha said that by year-end, Lazada plans to expand export opportunities for local sellers, enabling them to reach customers across Southeast Asia in five of its regional markets.&nbsp;\n\"We recognise that fashion and beauty are consistently the top-selling categories across Southeast Asia, particularly among young buyers aged 18-24. Leveraging this insight, our teams are incorporating campaigns and activities that are more engaging for younger generations, to better connect them with local and global brands that meet their tastes,\" she said.&nbsp;\nLazada also continues to provide opportunities to sellers by introducing a range of e-commerce tools to assist them in reaching more customers and growing their business, Ms Varitha added.&nbsp;\n\"By the end of this year, Lazada plans to expand export opportunities for local sellers, enabling them to reach customers across Southeast Asia in five of our regional markets. We foresee that this move will drastically reduce the barrier of entry into overseas markets and increase sellers' revenue.\"\nMoreover, it has introduced a sponsored media programme that allows Lazada's sellers to market products outside its platform.\nLazada has collaborated with Meta to introduce \"Lazada Sponsored Media\", a comprehensive solution designed to empower businesses to amplify their reach and drive sales. &nbsp;This tool lets sellers integrate their marketing campaigns with Meta's advertising platforms, including Facebook, Instagram, Messenger and Audience Network.\nMs Varitha added that Lazada is committed to driving the sustainable growth of Thai businesses by equipping its sellers with tools, knowledge, and new skills and campaigns, which contributed to a 121% average growth in the gross merchandise value of its small sellers from early 2023 to June 2024. &nbsp;\n\"As Lazada defines the next era of e-commerce, the focus will be on creating real value to sellers, shoppers, and partners. This means investing in the long game, putting our resources into initiatives and innovations that generate customer-centric outcomes and win-win scenarios for the entire ecosystem.\"\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat type of hotel location do you prefer in Thailand?\nBeachfront resorts\nCity-center hotels (close to shopping, restaurants, attractions\nSecluded, nature retreats\nNear airports for convenience\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nVaritha Kiatpinyochai\nLazada\nThailand\nDo you like the content of this article?\n8\n9\nCOMMENT\n(3)",

(Photo: Bloomberg)\nThe Asia and the Pacific region stand at a critical juncture, positioned both as a significant contributor to global\ngreenhouse gas emissions\nand a potential leader in transformative climate action. The Asian Development Bank (ADB), alongside our member countries, is steering the region towards a sustainable future through support for a just transition. Our vision aims to reorient economic and social frameworks to foster low-carbon, climate-resilient growth that enhances prosperity and inclusion.\nThe need for a just transition, one that puts people at the centre of the shift to net zero, cannot be overstated. Asia and the Pacific account for over half of the world's annual greenhouse gas emissions, driven by its dependence on fossil fuels. At the same time, more than 200 million people in the region are impoverished, with many lacking access to basic electricity and relying on traditional biomass for cooking and heating. Women are particularly affected and often face disproportionate impacts.\nAs Asia and the Pacific's climate bank, ADB prioritises an inclusive approach to ensure the costs and benefits of the transition to net zero are fairly distributed. Achieving net zero requires us to restructure our economies and change the way we live and work. It is paramount that in this process, the burdens of change are not imposed on the most vulnerable and that the benefits of a low-carbon economy are both maximised and shared equitably. Ensuring that all segments of society, including women, share in these benefits is critical to the success of our just transition efforts.\nADVERTISEMENT\nTo create opportunities for inclusive and sustainable growth, ADB works with partners to implement robust policy frameworks, enhance institutional capacities and engage stakeholders through participatory processes. These just transition efforts align with global commitments such as the Paris Agreement, and at the country level, we support our developing members in crafting policies and programs that respond to their unique climate challenges and development needs.\nRELATED\nthailand\nBIG and Delta Pioneer the First Low-Carbon Nitrogen  in Thailand's Electronics Industry\nlife\nTurning trash to cash\nAt COP27, ADB launched a Just Transition Support Platform to help drive a just transition within our developing member countries. This platform focuses on supporting countries to incorporate just transition into their institutional and policy frameworks and identify innovative financing approaches that attract public and private capital for a just transition. The platform also supports the mainstreaming of just transition in ADB's operations.\nMoreover, at COP28, ADB launched an inclusive process to design a Just Transition Finance Facility that will provide targeted finance to address the socio-economic challenges of the transition to net zero. It will help countries realise the economic and social benefits of the transition and ensure these benefits are inclusive and widespread, ultimately supporting a robust and equitable shift to low-carbon and resilient economies.\nJust transition is also a core part of ADB's Energy Transition Mechanism (ETM). Developed in partnership with ADB countries, ETM is a scalable initiative that has the potential to be one of the largest carbon-reduction schemes in the world. Under it, public and private investments finance country-specific ETM funds. These funds are designed to retire or repurpose coal power assets on an earlier schedule compared with a business-as-usual timeline.\nJust transition principles are a cornerstone of ETM's implementation, helping us to ensure that potential negative socio-economic impacts are minimised through policies and programmes. For example, retraining and reskilling programmes provide new opportunities for women and vulnerable workers in emerging industries.\nThe importance of managing the social impacts associated with the transition to net zero can be seen in ADB's work on the Cirebon 1 coal-fired power station in Indonesia. This plant serves as an ETM pilot, for which ADB completed a preliminary just transition assessment earlier this year -- the first of its kind for ADB and the region. The assessment utilised a comprehensive methodology to identify impacts along the coal value chain and within the community and surrounding areas. It also established a process to assess and develop a plan to manage impacts at the appropriate project stages.\nJust transition offers a compelling vision for green and inclusive development across Asia and the Pacific. Its promise lies not only in avoiding the worst impacts of climate change but in creating a more equitable social order that values well-being and gender equality, provides decent work, and ensures sustainable economic growth.\nWe must encourage optimism and concerted effort from all sectors of society to embrace the principles of justice and inclusivity that will be needed for a low-carbon, climate-resilient future. This journey faces challenges but is also filled with opportunities for transformative change that can forge a healthier, more equitable and prosperous world. The path we chart now will determine the climate legacy we leave for future generations.\nMasatsugu Asakawa is President of the Asian Development Bank.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat is your budget range for purchasing a house in Thailand?\nUnder 3 million THB\n3 million - 5 million THB\n5 million - 8 million THB\n8 million - 12 million THB\nOver 12 million THB\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nGas emissions\nClimate change\nDo you like the content of this article?\n2\n10\nCOMMENT\n(2)",

The event, filled with happiness, smiles, and heartfelt connections, took place at the Siam Kempinski Hotel in Bangkok. Professor Jennifer Mnookin, Chancellor of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, expressed her admiration for Thailand, the Land of Smiles, and her deep gratitude for the royal benevolence of Her Royal Highness Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn, who graciously granted an audience to the university's delegation during their visit to Thailand to celebrate the 175th anniversary of the University of Wisconsin-Madison in Bangkok.\n\"The University of Wisconsin-Madison was founded in 1849 with a mission to develop society through education, research, and public service under the concept of 'The Wisconsin Idea.' This concept's impact is evident in the success of its alumni, the advancements of its researchers, and the institution's engagement with communities both domestically and internationally. In Thailand, Chuang Kaset Silapakarn (Chuang Lochaya), the first Thai student to study at the university in 1921, greatly contributed to modern agriculture and agricultural education in Thailand.\nWe are grateful to many alumni who have built upon this idea to achieve success and become leaders in various fields at the international, national, and community levels. Most importantly, Her Royal Highness has supported various projects that have fostered strong relations between the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Thailand. One such project is the Thai Pavilion in Madison, Wisconsin, USA, gifted by the Thai government and the Wisconsin Alumni Association in Thailand. This pavilion symbolises the relationship between the two and promotes Thai art, culture, and architecture. Her Royal Highness's visit to the pavilion was a source of great pride for the University of Wisconsin-Madison and the Thai community in Wisconsin.\"\nADVERTISEMENT\nAssoc. Prof. Dr. Jomphong Mongkhonvanit, President of the University of Wisconsin Alumni Association in Thailand, stated, \"Today, we not only honour the remarkable journey of our beloved alma mater but also the enduring bonds that connect us as proud Badgers. This place has shaped, challenged, and prepared us to make our mark on the world.\"\n\"It is a great honour to welcome Professor Jennifer Mnookin, the 30th Chancellor in the 175-year history of the university, who has dedicated herself to elevating the university to new heights of excellence. She has invigorated and expanded the Wisconsin Idea, a commitment to innovation for the public good, by launching the Wisconsin RISE initiative for Research, Innovation, and Scholarly Excellence. This initiative expands educational and research opportunities to address significant and complex challenges affecting Wisconsin and our world. This has positioned the university as a national hub for innovation and economic prosperity, recognised as one of the leading institutions in the country for opening doors to new career opportunities in today's sustainable global trends.\"\n\"In an era where trends and forecasts emphasise environmental sustainability, with new opportunities becoming the trends of the future, significant changes in the world of work are emerging. These changes encompass knowledge, technology, and innovation, with businesses adapting well to future global scenarios. The University of Wisconsin has opened doors to five popular and trending career fields:\nData Science: Our world increasingly relies on data and computers for knowledge production and decision-making, encompassing data science and computer science.\nComputer Science: One of the fastest-growing majors, essential for acquiring the skills necessary to succeed in the digital age.\nConsumer and Market Behaviour Studies: Crucial for boosting revenue and understanding market trends.\nPsychology: With a continued demand for psychologists, addressing global mental health concerns is vital, spanning healthcare, law, business, education, conservation, and more.\nGlobal Health: Encompassing life sciences and public health, related to climate change, food systems, disease ecology, and collaborative efforts for well-being.\"\nVarawut Silpa-archa, Minister of Human Security and Social Development, stated, \u201cThe University of Wisconsin remains the institution that laid a strong foundation during the best period of my life. It completely transformed my worldview, taking me from engineering to a master's degree in business. This place not only imparts knowledge but also produces many individuals who have created and are creating quality growth opportunities for all of you, helping you become the best version of yourselves and making our world a better place. A shining example is Singapore\u2019s new Prime Minister, Lawrence Wong. I am confident that Thailand will progress through our alumni network and educational institutions.\u201d\n\u201cMoreover, we are leaders in combating climate change in our region. As a Thai alumnus, I, along with the UW community, want to assure everyone of our commitment and dedication. As the university celebrates its 175th anniversary, it will play a crucial role in driving the global community towards a more sustainable and brighter future.\u201d\nRenuka Weerakul, a senior representative of current students, 4th grade, at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, majoring in Economics, shared that she likes to think broadly, analyse, and reason logically, which led her to choose this field of study.\n\"I am interested in finance and management and see economics as a very fascinating subject, especially in today's global economic climate where competition is fierce, and the economies of various countries are interconnected. Having in-depth knowledge in this area makes one highly sought after by organisations, opening many opportunities in the future.\n\"I believe what I am learning can be applied to benefit our country. Economics provides a broad perspective on national issues such as the economy, social inequality, and labour markets. These insights can be utilised in various fields, such as supporting SMEs and social enterprises, to maximise the benefits and efficiency for the well-being of people in society.\"\nThitipong Lawphongpanich graduated with a bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from the University of Wisconsin-Madison two years ago and has since joined McKinsey &amp; Company (Thailand) Ltd., the world's leading consulting firm, as a management consultant in computer engineering.\n\"Studying computer engineering at the University of Wisconsin-Madison equipped me with strong analytical and problem-solving skills, technical expertise, and a data-driven decision-making approach. These abilities enable me to diagnose business problems, provide informed recommendations, and identify opportunities for process improvements and innovation. My experience in project management, teamwork, and communication has helped me manage projects efficiently and convey complex technical concepts to clients and stakeholders. Combining these skills bridges the gap between technology and business, offering valuable insights and solutions.\"\n\"Furthermore, I have had the opportunity to assist various industries in Thailand and Southeast Asia, including finance, venture capital, and consumer goods. I have applied my knowledge to support digital transformation strategies, corporate financial strategies, organisational capability building, and business growth. As a young professional, I want to see our country support all career paths and create a culture that values all professions equally. I believe in utilising technology to enhance efficiency in every occupation, continuously developing new skills, and emphasising lifelong learning and innovation. By fostering out-of-the-box thinking and creativity, we can develop sustainable new career trends on a global scale.\"\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat is your budget range for purchasing a condominium?\nUnder 2 million THB\n2 million - 4 million THB\n4 million - 7 million THB\n7 million - 10 million THB\nOver 10 million THB\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nDo you like the content of this article?\nCOMMENT",

Dispanadda Diskul (Duke)\n, CEO of Mae Fah Luang\nFoundation under Royal Patronage and the&nbsp;President of the Sasin Alumni Association, delivered a keynote on the transformative power of social entrepreneurship. The Mae Fah Luang Foundation&nbsp;has spearheaded sustainable development in Thailand, Indonesia, Afghanistan, and Myanmar through initiatives like the Doi Tung project, which rehabilitated an opium-dependent community by promoting reforestation and alternative crops like coffee. This effort expanded into diverse enterprises including cafes, tourism, handicrafts, and horticulture. Collaborations with global brands such as Ikea and Japan Airlines underscore the foundation\u2019s partnership ethos. Innovative products like handwoven fabrics from recycled PET bottles showcase their commitment to sustainability. \u201cThe world has the technology and knowledge to overcome crises\u2014the missing piece is global commitment. While social enterprises play a role, they're a small percentage. Integrating impactful practices into larger corporations is the challenge. Beyond Thailand, we aim to show businesses can transform the world, urging larger companies to embrace sustainability,\u201d M.L. Dispanadda Diskul asserted.\nAnother visionary keynote speaker was\nMechai Viravaidya,\nformer politician, lifelong activist, and Founder and Chairman of The Population and Community Development Association (PDA) and Mechai Bamboo School, who shared an inspiring journey of&nbsp;PDA\u2019s 50 Years of Experience with Social Enterprise.\nSince 1975, the association has funded rural development without shareholder distributions, instead reinvesting profits into education, conservation, livelihoods, and charitable activities. To attract investors, the association foundation ensures contributions grow, symbolised by planting a tree for every three dollars invested. Social enterprises like restaurants, gift shops, and local produce marts, affordable hotels, resorts, and scholarships enhance community\nlivelihoods.Mr\n.

Today, Sasin continues to expand collaborations with leading universities worldwide. \u201cThere\u2019s far too much knowledge out there to learn everything. And even if you did learn everything today, it will be useless tomorrow. What we have to do is to inspire people to seek new knowledge continuously. We need to connect them to like-minded others so that together they can transform business, transform the world, transform society. And a core part of that transformation is entrepreneurship,\u201d Dr. Fenwick noted.\nDibyendu Bose\n, Deputy Director of Strategy, Innovation &amp; Impact, Sasin School of Management,\noutlined Sasin Impact Entrepreneurship Week\u2019s goal to foster innovation, inclusivity, and positive change. \u201cWe are trying to build a hub, a platform, a vibrant ecosystem where entrepreneurs, start-ups, investors, policymakers and even the public can convene to ignite innovation, champion inclusivity and drive positive change.

This will be accomplished through energy transition, the development of Carbon Capture/Utilization and Storage (CCUS) technology, and managing a 212-million-baht green fund to achieve the Net Zero 2050 goal.\nDr Chana Poomee, Chairman of the Thai Cement Manufacturers Association (TCMA) and co-host of the GCCA CEO Gathering and Leaders Conference 2024, stated that this year\u2019s conference in Thailand was a significant gathering of leading cement manufacturers from around the globe. The event aimed to drive the cement and concrete industry towards carbon emission reduction, a global priority, through the development of innovations such as Carbon Capture/Utilization and Storage (CCUS), advanced production process technologies, low-carbon products, and energy transition. Additionally, there will be close coordination with government and related agencies to jointly advance these initiatives.\nThe GCCA 2024 conference underscores the vital importance of fostering cooperation across all sectors, domestic and international. Government policy support is crucial for the successful development of technology and innovation in various fields. The green fund also plays a significant role in achieving these goals.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe green fund from Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC), valued at 8 million Canadian dollars or approximately 212 million baht, awarded to Thailand\u2019s cement industry through the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO), represents a milestone for the industry. This funding will bolster the technology and innovation ecosystem, including pilot projects that will serve as models for accelerating the decarbonization of the cement industry.\nThailand's green fund boosts net zero cement roadmap\n\u201cThanks to the Government of Canada, GCCA, UNIDO, and TCMA members who have worked diligently over the past several years, Thailand has received this green fund, leading to important progress and recognized achievements. Part of this progress includes the Thailand 2050 Net Zero Cement and Concrete Roadmap, which is linked to the national greenhouse gas reduction plan (Thailand NDC Roadmap), and the key pilot project involving public, private, and community sectors in the \u2018SARABURI SANDBOX\u2019, the first prototype of a low-carbon city in Thailand. TCMA and all Thai cement manufacturers are ready to collaborate with all sectors, including the international partner networks of GCCA and UNIDO, to transform the cement industry in accordance with the Thailand 2050 Net Zero Cement and Concrete Roadmap,\u201d said Dr Chana Poomee.\nMr Fernando Gonz\u00e1lez, President of the Global Cement and Concrete Association (GCCA), emphasized that the GCCA 2024 Conference in Bangkok played a crucial role in accelerating the progress of the GCCA Net Zero Future Roadmap. The attendance of over 200 GCCA members from across the globe underscores the industry\u2019s strong determination and cooperation in the \u2018Decade to Deliver\u2019, which aims to identify and implement strategies for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\n\u201cAs a leader in the global cement industry, GCCA is deeply committed to building a more sustainable future. The support and participation of countries worldwide, alongside collaboration with government, policymakers, international organizations, and experts from various fields, are crucial. Through initiatives like Innovandi, we are developing new technologies and innovations, supporting the energy transition, and advancing Carbon Capture/Utilization and Storage (CCUS) technologies. These efforts will remarkably reduce carbon emissions in the cement industry and enable us to achieve the GCCA Net Zero Future by 2050,\u201d said Mr Fernando A. Gonz\u00e1lez.\nDuring the conference, an on-site technical learning exchange was another key activity facilitated, underscoring the importance of advancing sustainable development within Thailand\u2019s cement and construction industries. Insights were shared by GCCA members who visited the cement industry\u2019s Research and Innovation (R&amp;I) Center in Saraburi province and the One Bangkok project, both of which stand as Thailand\u2019s foremost examples of construction progress, applied sustainability principles, and the effort to strive towards the Net Zero goal.\nGCCA members applaud Thailand\u2019s sustainable cement innovations\n\u201cI am deeply impressed by the operations of the R&amp;I Center, which is tasked to develop innovative cement and concrete products that help reduce carbon emissions, including 3D Printing technology for real building applications. I\u2019d like to thank Governor Bancha Chaowarin of Saraburi Province, and TCMA for organizing this insightful visit. As the coordinator of the energy systems and decarbonisation, UNIDO stands ready to collaborate and support the acceleration of carbon reduction in the Thai cement industry.\u201d \u2014 Ms Racha Abdrabu, Project Coordinator, UNIDO Headquarters, Vienna, Austria.\n\u201cI am inspired by the warm reception and amazed by the achievements of those involved in the development of One Bangkok. This project exemplifies Thailand\u2019s expertise in high-rise design and construction, with LEED certification affirming its adherence to sustainability and environmental standards. It not only contributes to societal improvement but also aligns with global sustainability development guidelines.\u201d \u2014 Mr Daniel Duque, Director of Research and Development, Cementos Argos, Colombia.\nThe GCCA 2024 Conference also featured the photography exhibition \u2018Concrete in Life\u2019, highlighting the dynamic relationship between humans and the concrete environment through diverse perspectives. The photos were showcased by categories, including Urban Concrete, Concrete Infrastructure, Concrete in Daily Life, and Beauty and Design. These photos symbolize the commitment of the cement and concrete industry to advancing the GCCA Concrete Future Roadmap towards sustainability and achieving Net Zero by 2050.\nThe week of the \u201cGCCA CEO Gathering and Leader Conference 2024\u201d has drawn to a successful close. TCMA, as co-host, takes pride in its contribution to hosting the global cement industry conference for the first time in Bangkok, which has brought progress and benefits to Thailand. TCMA members collaborated to ensure a warm reception, accommodating the participants\u2019 needs from their arrival, with hospitality and smiles. A welcome reception took place aboard the Chao Phraya River Cruise, featuring vibrant fireworks and traditional Thai cultural performances.\nAttendees were impressed by the souvenirs reflecting the Thai identity in the theme of \u2018Timeless Partnership\u2019. These included a unique vintage pocket watch adorned with hand-painted Thai motifs, porcelain-style, a pair of elephant-shaped salt and pepper jars crafted from Lampang ceramics, and a traditional Pha Khao Ma-handwoven traditional loincloth, a legacy of intangible Thai cultural heritage.\n\u201cTCMA remains at the forefront of the cement industry, collaborating across sectors to advance towards Net Zero 2050. The outcomes of the discussions and progress will be presented at COP29 in November 2024.

        "content": "Thailand\nPR News\nGroundbreaking Collaboration for Enhanced Haemophilia Care\nThe \"EquiStep\" project unites Novo Nordisk, Nanyang, and the Thai Haemophilia Patient Club to promote awareness and inclusive care for haemophilia in Thailand.\nPUBLISHED : 26 Jun 2024 at 19:14\n&nbsp; Small\n&nbsp; Medium\n&nbsp; Large\n11\nNovo Nordisk, a leading global healthcare company, Nanyang, a renowned Thai footwear manufacturer, and the Thai Haemophilia Patient Club, announced the pioneering \"EquiStep\" collaboration. This joint effort aims to raise awareness about haemophilia, advocate for access to care, and promote inclusivity for individuals living with this rare bleeding disorder in Thailand.\nHaemophilia is considered a rare disease, whereby the World Federation of Haemophilia has estimated the number of cases worldwide at approximately 320,000. It is estimated that Thailand has 5,750 cases of haemophilia, but in reality only 2,138 or a mere 37% of all patients are officially registered in the Thailand Haemophilia Registry. The remaining 62% of patients with mild to moderate symptoms have not been registered. In other words, the majority of patients are not able to access adequate care and efficient treatments.\nProf. Pantep Angchaisuksiri, M.D., Professor of Medicine at Ramathibodi Hospital, Mahidol University and President of the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH), highlighted the multifaceted challenges faced by haemophilia patients: \"Haemophilia, or the bleeding disorder, is a genetic condition that causes deficiency in blood clotting factors. It is passed down through an abnormal gene, with mothers being carriers who can pass it on to their children. The disorder is more common in boys than girls,\" Prof. Pantep explained. \"Frequent symptoms include joint bleeds leading to pain, and mobility issues. Muscle bleeds result in bruising. Patients can have prolonged bleeding from injuries, unexplained nosebleeds and blood in urine. Severe cases risk life-threatening internal bleeding. Early diagnosis and prophylactic clotting factor treatment are crucial to manage this lifelong genetic condition and prevent complications like chronic joint damage.\"\n\u201cAs the ISTH President, The International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) is at the forefront of addressing global healthcare disparities, especially in haemophilia care. Our commitment to research excellence and innovation drives the development of clinical guidelines that inform payer decisions and elevate equitable care. Through international collaboration, we're not just sharing knowledge\u2014we're shaping a future where every person with haemophilia has access to the treatment they need to lead fulfilling lives,\" Prof. Pantep explained.\nAs part of the \"EquiStep\" project, Nanyang will produce 1,500 pairs of shoes featuring a special design by renowned artist Kru Parn - Somnuek Klangnok or Parnarts, incorporating the \u201cCocoon\" character. \"As a 100% genuine Thai rubber footwear brand that has been alongside Thai people for over 70 years, manufacturing more than 300 million pairs of shoes and receiving quality certification from the Thai Industrial Standards Institute, Nanyang takes pride in being recognised as a 'Premium Thai Product' by the government,\" said Chakrapol Chandavimol, Ph.D., Managing Director of Nanyang Marketing Co., Ltd. \"We are proud to contribute our expertise to this meaningful cause. Our contribution underscores our commitment to fostering inclusive access to essential resources for all, as the symbolic nature of Nanyang\u2019s contribution has long represented equality.\"\n\"This multi-stakeholder partnership represents a significant stride towards ensuring equitable access to essential resources and comprehensive care for the haemophilia community in Thailand,\" said Ekawat Suwantaroj, Vice President of the Thai Haemophilia Patient Club and a person with severe haemophilia A. He expressed sincere gratitude to the government for their efforts in addressing the healthcare needs of haemophilia patients. He also shared that the Thai Haemophilia Patient Club has been established for more than 20 years and currently has over 700 members nationwide. It has 5 regional chapters across the country, coordinating with the National Haemophilia Foundation of Thailand to facilitate their activities.\nProf. Darintr Sosothikul, M.D., Professor of Paediatric and Chief of the Haematology and Oncology at Chulalongkorn Hospital, elaborated on the current standard of care for haemophilia treatment as recommended by the World Federation of Haemophilia - prophylactic treatment. \"Instead of waiting for bleeding episodes to occur, prophylaxis involves regularly infusing clotting factor concentrates, typically 1-2 times per week, to maintain adequate factor levels above 1% at all times. This preventive approach helps avoid bleeding episodes altogether and allows for near-normal musculoskeletal development and function in haemophilia patients.\"\n\"Ensuring equitable access to comprehensive haemophilia care is a top priority for Novo Nordisk,\" said Enrico Ca\u00f1al Bruland, VP &amp; General Manager, Novo Nordisk Pharma (Thailand). \"Through the 'EquiStep' project, we aim to support haemophilia patients by providing holistic resources that can improve their quality of life, in line with Novo Nordisk's policy of collaborating with all stakeholders to elevate the quality of life for patients. We hope that this collaborative project will spark everyone to see the importance of the rights that patients should have in accessing treatment, in order to create equity in access to medical care and in Thai society.\"\nThe \"EquiStep\" collaboration underscores the shared vision and ambition of Novo Nordisk, Nanyang, and the Thai Haemophilia Patient Club to fostering equity in healthcare access and improving outcomes for individuals living with haemophilia in Thailand. The shoes are designed to symbolise equality and non-discrimination, highlighting the importance of awareness about equality and underscoring the potential for patients to lead normal lives with proper treatment.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat is your budget range for purchasing a condominium?\nUnder 2 million THB\n2 million - 4 million THB\n4 million - 7 million THB\n7 million - 10 million THB\nOver 10 million THB\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nEquiStep\nDo you like the content of this article?\n0\n0",

Many Thais are returning to work in the agricultural sector there even though the Israel-Hamas war has intensified.\u2009(Photo: 123rf.com)\nAs we celebrate Israel's 76th Independence Day, we do so this year with mixed emotions of joy and solemn reflection. This milestone is a testament to our nation's enduring resilience and remarkable achievements, yet it is shadowed by the immense challenges we have faced in the past year.\nThe Oct 7 massacre has become part of the history we will forever hold in our collective memory. The pain and grief inflicted by this heinous act of terror still resonate deeply within our hearts. We mourn the lives lost and honour the bravery of those who valiantly defended our homeland. The scars left by this tragedy serve as a stark reminder of the ongoing threats aimed at undermining Israel's very existence.\nIn the aftermath of the Oct 7 terror attack, an unfortunate and unexpected bond was forged between Israel and Thailand. Thirty-nine Thai families experienced unimaginable loss, joining the community of bereaved Israeli families in mourning. Thirty-one Thai citizens were taken hostage by Hamas terrorists, enduring inconceivable trauma alongside their Israeli counterparts. Tragically, eight Thais still remain captive, held alongside 124 Israelis. The pain of their absence is felt keenly by their loved ones, in Israel and in Thailand, and our hearts are united in solidarity with them and their families. Israel remains steadfast in its commitment to securing the release of all hostages, standing shoulder to shoulder with the families of the victims, both Israeli and Thai, hoping to witness the return of all the hostages home as soon as possible.\nADVERTISEMENT\nDespite the hardships we have endured, the friendship between Israel and Thailand continues to flourish. Our shared experiences have strengthened the bonds between our two nations, fostering a spirit of solidarity and cooperation. As we look to the future, we are determined to build upon this foundation, expanding our collaboration in vital areas to both of our countries, such as food technology, agriculture, water technology, cyber security and defence.\nIn recent years, Israel and Thailand have made significant strides in strengthening their partnership across various sectors. The exchange of knowledge and expertise has benefited both countries, driving innovation and fostering investments and economic growth. Through joint initiatives and collaborative projects, we have demonstrated the power of cooperation in addressing shared challenges and seizing opportunities for mutual prosperity.\nRELATED\nbusiness\nGlobal Oil Prices Drop Amid Economic and Geopolitical Pressures\nopinion\nSyria receives another chance with Assad gone\nIn the field of food technology, Israeli innovations have helped increase agricultural productivity and enhance food security in Thailand, while Thai industry has supported the growth of Israeli startups. Our expertise in water management has played a crucial role in mitigating the impact of droughts and ensuring access to clean water for communities across the country. In the realm of defence, our close cooperation has bolstered Thailand's security capabilities, enabling the country to better defend itself against external threats.\nAs we celebrate Israel's Independence Day, we renew our commitment to pursuing peace and prosperity for all. Despite the challenges we face, we remain optimistic and steadfast in our belief that a brighter future is within reach. Together, let us forge a path forward guided by the principles of unity, resilience, and shared progress.\nIn conclusion, I extend my heartfelt gratitude to the people of Thailand for their unwavering friendship and support. As we stand together in solidarity, may our partnership continue to thrive and flourish in the years to come.\nOrna Sagiv&nbsp;is the Ambassador of Israel to Thailand and Cambodia.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nHow important are environmental sustainability practices (e.g., eco-friendly rooms, waste reduction) when choosing accommodation in Thailand?

(Photo: Chanat Katanyu)\nThe government is facing increasing pressure from pro-cannabis groups which are threatening to rally at the Ministry of Public Health from Thursday until the ministry can prove that cannabis deserves to be reclassified as a narcotic drug.\nIn the meantime, groups of farmers licensed to grow cannabis plants since before the decriminalisation of cannabis in 2022, on Sunday&nbsp;backed the government's vow to reclassify cannabis as a narcotic drug again.\nThey say the legalisation of cannabis cultivation has led to a steep fall in cannabis prices due to oversupply of the product which was once strictly controlled.\nADVERTISEMENT\nWhen the pro-cannabis groups gather at the ministry, they will ask for only one thing -- that the ministry shows scientifically the benefits and health risks of cannabis in comparison to alcohol and cigarettes, said Prasitchai Nunual, secretary-general of the Cannabis Future Network.\nRELATED\nthailand\nPeople's Party seeks a provincial win\nthailand\nTwo alleged yakuza held for abduction, extortion\nNo matter whether the ministry aims to totally or partially reclassify cannabis as a narcotic, the decision should be supported with scientific evidence, he said. The ministry will be given 15 days to prove its point and if it can convince the pro-cannabis groups, they would bow to the ministry's policy to relist cannabis as a narcotic drug, he said.\n\"Just search on the internet and you will find that [unlike alcohol and tobacco], there have been no research which show cannabis has a serous negative impact on mental health,\" he said.\n\"On the other hand, there are countless studies which demonstrate the health benefits of cannabis, which are sufficient to conclude that cannabis plants have medicinal properties,\" he said.\nAs for reports the number of young people found abusing cannabis as a recreational drug\nhas surged by 10 times\n&nbsp;since the former government's decriminalisation of cannabis, Mr Prasitchai said his network has from the beginning been fighting for a law to more effectively control the use of cannabis.\n\"We've been fighting for this law for two years since the Prayut Chan-o-cha administration; but the required law will never be passed for various political reasons,\" he said.\nThe irony is while this government has pushed to relax the state's control of alcohol sales and consumption, it is moving to impose more legal restrictions on cannabis, he said.\nPrime Minister Srettha Thavisin, meanwhile, hinted that the government might continue allowing cannabis to be used strictly for medical purposes even after it is reclassified as a narcotic drug. Public Health Minister Somsak Thepsuthin later will offer more details about this, said Mr Srettha.\nDespite its intention to relist cannabis as a narcotic, the government will listen to opinions from all sides first and leave the final decision to the Narcotics Control Board, he said.\nMontri Yiamsung-noen, president of Rak Kan community enterprise network in tambon Nong Bua Sala of Muang district in Nakhon Ratchasima, said he supports the government's new stance.\nMore than 90% of the farmland owned by the 435 farmers in the network, licensed to grow cannabis since before the last government freed up the rules, now sits idle after cannabis prices plunged due to oversupply.\nA source in a similar cannabis plant-growing community enterprise group in Sakhon Nakhon said his group shared the same position.\nBefore the 2022 cannabis decriminalisation, dried marijuana leaves used to be sold at 10,500 baht per kilogramme and orders were placed with the group a year in advance, while now the products sell for just 5 to 10 baht/kg, said the source. Worse still, several tonnes of cannabis plants which had been harvested previously remain in stock awaiting buyers, he said.\nDeputy Prime Minister and Interior Minister Anutin Charnvirakul said a formal study will be conducted and its findings reviewed by two to three panels before any decision to change the legal status of cannabis is approved.\nMr Anutin is the leader of Bhumjaithai Party, which pushed for cannabis decriminalisation during the past government.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat is your budget range for purchasing a condominium?\nEkkamai-Thong Lor\nSathorn-Silom\nChidlom-Siam\nBang Na\nChinatown\nAri\nRiverside\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nCannabis\nLaw\nDecriminalisation\nHemp\nRecriminalisation\nWeed\nDo you like the content of this article?\n104\n61\nCOMMENT\n(44)",

It also urges people living with diabetes to dispose their used insulin pens at drop off areas in six pilot hospitals; namely, Chulalongkorn Hospital, Thai Red Cross Society, Ramathibodi Hospital, Siriraj Hospital, Bangkok Metropolitan Administration General Hospital, Srinagarind Hospital in Khon Kaen, and Maharaj Nakorn Chiang Mai Hospital, which is affiliated with Chiang Mai University. This initiative has contributed in driving Thailand towards carbon neutrality by 2050 and in achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2065.\nDarawan Luyapan, Commercial Lead of General Medicines at Sanofi Thailand,\nsaid,\n\"Sanofi has transformed the practice of medicine through breakthrough science to make a positive impact on our people and the communities we serve. We have been operating in Thailand for a long time and have continuously worked with the diabetes community to provide knowledge about the disease, self-care, and insulin usage education. Of over 5.2 million people living with diabetes in Thailand, more than 800,000 use Sanofi\u2019s insulin pens annually, generating approximately 17 tons of plastic waste. Thanks to\n\u201cSanofi Planet Care Upcycling Program: Giving a New Life to Used Insulin Pens\u201d\n, this will be\nthe first time in Thailand that used insulin pens will be collected and properly recycled,\na milestone made possible through the collaboration of all sectors, recognising the importance of proper waste management and transforming it into more valuable products.\"\nDr. Suracha Udomsak, Chief Innovation Officer of SCG Chemicals Public Company Limited, or SCGC,\nsaid,\n\"Used insulin pens constitute a massive and growing volume of medical waste annually. If these are improperly disposed of or managed, they can spread infectious diseases within communities, adversely affecting public health and causing environmental pollution. SCGC leverages its expertise in green polymer innovation\nto recycle the plastic from used insulin pens into new products using advanced recycling technology.\nThis reflects our business strategy under the ESG guidelines, applying circular economy concepts in a tangible way. This project\nhelps to enhance the systematic and efficient disposal of medical waste within the country and sustainably mitigates the spread of diseases in communities.\nIt aligns with the Ministry of Public Health's roadmap for municipal waste management to develop the environment and enhance public health safety.\"\nRELATED\nthailand\nSCG: Leading Green Innovation and Empowerment\nlearning\nOne dead in Rayong gas tank blast\nThosaphol Suppametheekulwat, CEO of CirPlas Tech Company Limited,\nsaid,\n\"Cirplas is a start-up company that focuses on one-stop service solutions for plastic waste, from collecting, sorting, and recycling.

Currently, approximately 5.2 million people in Thailand are living with diabetes, and insulin is one of the important solutions to control blood sugar level. Once used, the insulin pens become waste that must be disposed of properly. The\n'Check, Remove, Dispose'\ncampaign, which involves drop off boxes for used insulin pens in hospitals, is\nhighly commendable as an act of social responsibility.\nThe Association believes that the collaboration of all parties, to collectively reduce waste management issues and environmental impacts, offers an excellent solution to improve the quality of life for people, society, communities, and the environment. This initiative also aligns with the sustainable development goals, or SDGs.\"\nSakarn Bunnag, M.D., Deputy Director General of the Department of Medical Services under the Ministry of Public Health,\nsaid,\n\"The Ministry of Public Health is aware of the dangers of global warming, which impacts people's health and quality of life.

The remaining nearly 90% contribute to environmental pollution,\ncausing contamination in the soil and water sources, affecting the quality of water for domestic and agricultural use, marine life health, and ultimately, our own health.

The main highlight was the display of electric vehicles (EVs), with a total of 47 automotive brands participating, including 35 traditional automotive brands and 12 EV brands such as BYD, Aiways, AION, FIREBRIGHT, Chang\u2019an, NETA, HONRI, POCCO, NEXPOINT, and VINFAST, all pioneers in the electric vehicle industry.\nAmong the many EV companies, FIREBRIGHT stood out as particularly unique, showcasing the company's comprehensive solutions based on multi-brand, multi-model development of swappable electric vehicles, shared and standardised universal multi-engine battery packs, and fully automated swapping stations (energy service station). This acclaimed showcase garnered significant attention among various automakers, attracting interviews from renowned automotive media and tech bloggers such as AUTOLIFE\nTHAILAND.TV\nand DriveAutoBlog. Not only did Southeast Asia witness the display of swappable electric vehicles for the first time, it was also shown the only shared battery pack and swapping facilities system that covers multiple models &amp; brands of passenger and commercial vehicles in EV industry. Local visitors also discovered that FIREBRIGHT's swappable electric solution can delay or reduce the significant investment required for grid upgrades in Southeast Asia to meet the recharging needs of electric vehicles.\nPioneering Green Mobility\nFIREBRIGHT is the first swappable electric vehicle company to enter the Southeast Asian market, setting itself apart from other electric vehicle companies in the industry. FIREBRIGHT's swappable model is more flexible and adaptable to various green travel needs. In addition to the advantages of swappable solutions already summarised in the industry, FIREBRIGHT's independently developed modular swappable solution has also addressed the biggest pain points in swapping, possessing unique and crucial advantages. This achievement has enabled the realisation of a \u201cOne for All, All for One\u201d shared swapping station and shared battery pack, compatible with multiple brands and model vehicles within the shared swapping ecosystem.\nWhen executives from FIREBRIGHT Thailand were interviewed by DriveAutoBlog at the exhibition hall, the flexibility and stability of the battery system was emphasised. \"Each battery pack, managed by Super BMS, can work independently or collaboratively, significantly enhancing the reliability of the vehicle system. Moreover, the maintenance costs are lower, the lifespan is longer, and they can be reused many times continuously.\" Therefore, FIREBRIGHT's EASY EV total solution -- through shared standardised battery packs plus swapping stations, unique high safety margins, high reliability design,-- aims to build a more optimised and sustainable ecosystem, making it more adaptable for large-scale implementation, rapidly covering various vehicle scenarios and needs with higher resource efficiency. Each aspect of this ecosystem has clear, credible, and sustainable profit expectations, attracting many potential business partners during the exhibition.\nFlexible Travel Choices\nAt this motor show, FIREBRIGHT showcased four vehicle models including electric passenger cars, electric light trucks, and the flagship product: an electric pickup truck. Among them, the electric pickup truck and electric light-duty truck were introduced for the first time in the industry in a swappable format, with the pickup truck being the first to determine battery capacity based on range. The flexible design of the battery capacity offers users two choices: one emphasising range by demand, allowing users to choose the number of swappable battery packs and swap times, and the other focusing on battery capacity by demand for on-demand electricity use.\nIn a world increasingly pursuing sustainable development and clean energy, FIREBRIGHT's presence at the Bangkok Motor Show signifies a significant step in promoting eco-friendly travel and technological innovation. This event not only showcased the latest models and technologies of FIREBRIGHT's electric vehicles but also conveyed the company's vision and commitment to future travel methods for the public, actively striving to provide a highly efficient, convenient, low-carbon, and joyful travel option for the people.\nPractitioner of Social Responsibility\nThe executives from FIREBRIGHT Thailand revealed that the company planned to build local car and battery pack factories, as well as energy services via operating battery swap stations. The company is looking forward to working with local partners, so to build a true green ecosystem in the Thailand and the South East Asia.\nFIREBRIGHT is deeply aware of the responsibilities that companies hold in social development. The company emphasises its commitment to environmental protection, aiming to support the development of local environmental projects. Through community engagement activities, FIREBRIGHT is dedicated to raising public awareness of clean energy and sustainable lifestyles.\nFurthermore, FIREBRIGHT plans to expand this model to more cities and regions in the coming years, contributing to global sustainable development efforts. The company will continue to focus on developing more clean energy technologies and intelligent transportation solutions, collaborating with global partners to collectively build a greener, smarter, and more sustainable future.\"\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat factor most influences your decision to choose a hotel or resort?\nPrice and discounts\nHotel reviews and ratings\nProximity to attractions\nHotel loyalty programs (e.g., points, rewards)\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nFIREBRIGHT\nDo you like the content of this article?",

Of note is that while there is a tendency among Thai authorities to avoid the term \"refugees\", that term is understood internationally to cover persons fleeing from their home country over a well-founded fear of persecution. In practice, this can encompass persons fleeing warfare.\nA key international rule is that they should not be pushed back into areas of danger (\"non-refoulement\") and that they should benefit from international protection offered by the international community due to the lack of national protection from the country of origin.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThere are some five different groups of entrants now at stake.\nThe first caseload is some 90,000 refugees from Myanmar who have been here for over three decades. They are mainly from ethnic groups who escaped the conflict with the authorities and are now in nine camps along Thailand's western border. Generally, they are not pushed back (\"refouler\") and are afforded safety in this country. They benefit from registration and documentation in the camps, thus enjoying a degree of transparency and protection through identification.\nRELATED\nthailand\nMarriage equality law likely by early 2025\nopinion\nOur UN obligations on disappearances\nThey are not detained as illegal immigrants under the national immigration law unless they venture outside the camps without permission. However, they are still not allowed to work in Thailand. There is a trickle of cases for third-country resettlement, but voluntary repatriation is not possible due to the intransigent situation in Myanmar, while local settlement in Thailand is not yet an available option.\nFor this group, the preferred pathway should be to ensure that the various documents concerning their status are better recognised and their access to education and other basics of life should be improved. More importantly, they should be allowed to work, instead of languishing in the camps, having little access to productive activities.\nThe second group is the Rohingya refugees. This Muslim group is mainly from Rakhine state in Myanmar and they are part of a longstanding exodus from Myanmar. The persecution they face includes the prevention of births, the blocking of freedom of movement and the non-recognition of their status resulting in statelessness. In their escape, many have been victims of trafficking and smuggling. While the biggest influxes have gone to Bangladesh, a small group have traveled through Thailand in search of refuge. In recent years, a number of those arriving by sea were pushed back out to sea instead of being granted temporary refuge. Regrettably, today several hundred (including children) are in immigration detention. This is in spite of the MoU which Thailand adopted several years ago to end the detention of children in immigration cases. A current need is thus to enable them to have access to safety and be freed from immigration detention. A possible breakthrough might be to enable the Muslim community here to help shelter them, at least as a temporary solution.\nThe preferred pathway for this group is to apply better parts of the policy already adopted for the first group of 90,000 refugees mentioned above, to benefit the Rohingya. Thus, the principle of no push-back should be abided by. There should be a guarantee to safety, temporary refuge free from immigration detention as well as documentation, assistance and protection and avenues to various solutions, such as third-country resettlement. Interestingly, a large number of Rohingya have found livelihoods in the Middle East and this can be explored further.\nThe third group is the tens of thousands who sought refuge in Thailand from 2021 to 2023 after the coup in Myanmar at the beginning of 2021. Many came from ethnic groups, displaced by warfare. The situation on this side of the fence was that they were housed in some 15 temporary safety areas run by the armed forces. However, they have been shifted back to Myanmar. The lesson learned from this group is that the principle of no push-back should have been respected more effectively, with more transparent documentation, access to assistance and protection, and strengthened temporary refuge, pending other solutions.\nCurrently, there is a fourth group at stake: those who are or might be arriving this year in the midst of the heavy fighting in Myanmar. This is compounded by the fact that there are nearly 3 million internally displaced persons in that country, some of whom may need to cross the border to access safety. Preparedness and humane response would dictate that the authorities on this side of the fence should abide by the principle of no push-back, access to safety, documentation, protection and assistance and temporary refuge in the meantime.\nThe barometer for action should be based on respect for their safety and dignity. Administratively, the task of caring for them should be based on inter-agency cooperation to ensure shared responsibility with monitoring for transparency.\nFinally, there is another group which might be arriving: fighters or combatants from the various protagonist groups in Myanmar. Since Thailand views itself as a neutral country, basic principles of neutrality guided by the age-old international law of neutrality come into play. Those combatants who come into Thai territory need to be disarmed on arrival. The wounded, sick and those who have laid down their arms need to be assisted and protected from attacks. They need to be kept away from the border, and there should be international access to monitor their well-being. Of course, no munitions should be offered or channelled from Thailand to the various warring factions.\nIn sum, various constructive practices in the past emanating from Thailand should be advanced, while opacity, neglect and negligence should be avoided. Commitment with foresight, based on buoyant leadership with policy and practice embedded in a spirit of humanity, would be much welcome.\nVitit Muntarbhorn&nbsp;is a Professor Emeritus at Chulalongkorn University.

In 2005, Malaysia helped establish the East Asia Summit (EAS), and in 2015, the Asean Community Vision 2025 was launched. Many policymakers and scholars agree that the next chairmanship is perfectly timed for Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, one of the region's most experienced leaders.\nTo showcase Malaysia, the chair revealed its logo and theme of \"Inclusivity and Sustainability\". The colourful logo depicts the country's national flower, the bunga raya. The inward-curving design symbolises the strength of Asean centrality and unity.\nMalaysia faces numerous formidable challenges. The chair must fine-tune the right approach to increasing intra-Asean cooperation in all pillars and strengthening relations with dialogue partners, especially China and the US. It will also be a landmark year as Malaysia launches the new Asean Community Vision 2045, which will chart the Asean strategic pathway in the next twenty years.\nADVERTISEMENT\nFurthermore, Asean is expected to welcome Timor-Leste as its 11th member. The chair will also broaden the engagement between Asean and other developing economies in the Global South, including the Gulf Cooperation Council and Brics.\nRELATED\nopinion\nUniting against cyber-scam gangs\nthailand\nPheu Thai's Prayuth, crusader against military coups\nAt the Brics summit in Kazan, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, and Indonesia were made Brics partners.\nAt the 46th Asean Summit scheduled for May 5-7, 2025, the Asean leaders will adopt the 1,830-word Asean Community Vision 2045. This ambitious document addresses a wide range of issues and scenarios.\nThe vision was based on input from the bloc's top bureaucrats and thinkers who understand Asean. These experts have also outlined strategic plans across the three pillars, connectivity, and improvement of the Asean Secretariat to ensure its future success. The Vision 2045 document is the product of extensive consultation involving both top-down and bottom-up processes, including input from civil society and the private sector.\nThe Asean Community Vision 2045 is a forward-looking blueprint that seeks to position Asean as a dynamic, resilient, innovative and people-centric regional organisation. Future-ready Asean will be nimble and agile. It emphasises sustainability, economic integration, human capital development, and technological innovation as future pillars.\nMost importantly, the vision recognises the changing global order, especially the shift towards multipolarity.\nIn recent months, Mr Anwar has not held back when speaking about key regional and global issues, including the Myanmar quagmire, the South China Sea dispute, the current Middle East crisis, and the ongoing US-China rivalry. His frank comments on these issues have been unusual among his Asean colleagues.\nWell before the recent chairmanship handover from Laos to Malaysia, Mr Anwar made it clear that Asean, under his leadership, would be an active player, aiming to raise the bloc's profile and relevance on the global stage.\nMr Anwar's outspoken stance on the Middle East crisis has particularly gained attention. Following the escalation of violence in Gaza, Mr Anwar condemned the large-scale civilian casualties and emphasised the need for immediate humanitarian assistance. He has called for a ceasefire and urged the US to take a more balanced approach to the conflict.\nReaffirming Asean's position on the Palestinian problem, he advocated a two-state solution that respects the rights of both Israelis and Palestinians. Mr Anwar's comments on the Middle East crisis reflect his broader foreign policy approach, which emphasises moral clarity and the pursuit of peace. He has also urged Asean members to stay united despite growing global tensions. Asean must be a stabilising force in the region.\nAs Asean chair, Mr Anwar is expected to find innovative diplomatic approaches to balance the two competing superpowers -- the US and China. The former is the region's main security guarantor, and the latter is its most important economic partner. He frequently stressed the importance of the bloc's strategic autonomy and that its members must not be drawn into the superpowers' polarisation.\n\"Anwar is an old hand. He knows the geopolitical contours of the day,\" commented Phar Kim Beng, a Malaysian scholar on international affairs.\nMalaysia is also eager to expand Asean and admit Timor-Leste. The debate is no longer about whether the world's youngest democracy is ready to join Asean but whether it should be left behind -- waiting for the full implementation of the Asean-proposed roadmap. In Vientiane, some Asean leaders sympathised with Dilli, arguing that if strict conditions remain, the country might take several years to join the Asean family.\nAs a result, there were talks about \"discounts\" on the 220 economic agreements Timor-Leste must accede to. Before joining the World Trade Organization (WTO) at the end of August, Timor-Leste submitted a note to the Asean Secretariat showing its readiness to meet 66 key agreements after the admission. The remaining agreements will be implemented within six to eight years. A compromise number of agreements must be agreed upon.\nWhen Malaysia holds its first foreign ministerial retreat in January 2025 in Langkawi to discuss and set forth the Asean agenda, they must indicate if Timor-Leste will become a full member by that year. As one seasoned Asean diplomat put it, its membership is at a \"now or never\" crossroads.\nFor the past decade, the focus has been zeroed in on Timor-Leste's preparedness to participate in Asean's three pillars: political/security, economic, and socio/cultural. Various Asean members and experts have visited the country in the past two years, preparing the roadmap for its membership.\nThe Asean leaders face a Catch-22 situation. Joining Asean in the post-pandemic era, Timor-Leste could complicate the bloc's economic integration and other decision-making processes. Dili also lacks the human resources necessary to participate in Asean's extensive meetings, which are almost on par with the United Nations in terms of frequency.\nOn the other hand, leaving Timor-Leste behind the Asean family could open the door for external powers to exert influence over the country, especially given its rich energy resources and substantial oil reserves. Truth be told, the time has come for Asean leaders to make a political decision on whether to welcome Timor-Leste into the group.\nDuring the chairmanship handover ceremony on Oct 9, Mr Anwar announced that Malaysia will host the Asean-Gulf Cooperation Council plus China Summit. This summit is one of the flagship events under his leadership. It will certainly have significant global impacts due to the bloc's role in bridging the Gulf States and China.\nLast week in Kazan, Malaysia became one of 12 Brics partners, which included three other Asean members -- Thailand, Vietnam, and Indonesia. As such, under the Malaysian chair, Asean's ability to promote communication, dialogue and cooperation with emerging economies, big and small, points to its ability to serve as a bridge between key global players, including G20, further ramping up Asean relevance.\nTo do that, the East Asia Summit (EAS), which will celebrate its 20th anniversary next year, needs fresh ideas to bolster its role as the world's top strategic forum. The latest EAS meeting showed cracks among its members, especially the eight dialogue partners, which could threaten Asean unity. If this trend continues, the future of EAS could be in jeopardy. It can weaken this strategic platform. The Jakarta-based EAS envoys accredited to Asean should have more dialogue in shepherding the EAS summit and deliverables.\nMr Anwar's experience and direct approach, especially on contentious global issues, suggest that Asean, under Malaysia's chairmanship, could see more assertive diplomacy and a greater focus on ensuring the bloc's long-term relevance. One caveat is in order, granted all favourite circumstances -- the chair must still be modest.\nKavi Chongkittavorn\nA veteran journalist on regional affairs\nKavi Chongkittavorn is a veteran journalist on regional affairs\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat is your budget range for renting a condominium?\nUnder 10,000 THB/month\n10,000 - 20,000 THB/month\n20,000 - 40,000 THB/month\n40,000 - 60,000 THB/month\nOver 60,000 THB/month\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nOpinion\nAsean\nMalaysia\nEast Asia Summit\nEAS\nAsean Community Vision 2025\nPrime Minister\nAnwar Ibrahim\n\u0e2d\u0e32\u0e40\u0e0b\u0e35\u0e22\u0e19\n\u0e21\u0e32\u0e40\u0e25\u0e40\u0e0b\u0e35\u0e22\n\u0e01\u0e32\u0e23\u0e1b\u0e23\u0e30\u0e0a\u0e38\u0e21\u0e2a\u0e38\u0e14\u0e22\u0e2d\u0e14\u0e40\u0e2d\u0e40\u0e0a\u0e35\u0e22\u0e15\u0e30\u0e27\u0e31\u0e19\u0e2d\u0e2d\u0e01\n\u0e27\u0e34\u0e2a\u0e31\u0e22\u0e17\u0e31\u0e28\u0e19\u0e4c\u0e1b\u0e23\u0e30\u0e0a\u0e32\u0e04\u0e21\u0e2d\u0e32\u0e40\u0e0b\u0e35\u0e22\u0e19 2025\n\u0e19\u0e32\u0e22\u0e01\u0e23\u0e31\u0e10\u0e21\u0e19\u0e15\u0e23\u0e35\nDo you like the content of this article?\n9\n15\nCOMMENT\n(2)",

Current US President Joe Biden assumed office as the nation's 46th president on Jan 20, 2021. He withdrew his candidacy for the election in July, endorsing his Vice-President Kamala Harris as the Democratic nominee.\nThe two candidates offer a stark contrast in policies, leading Thai economists and business leaders to predict widely varying effects on the Thai economy depending on the victor in what is expected to be a close race.\nADVERTISEMENT\nHowever on some issues, observers believe no matter who wins the election, the consequences for Thailand are unlikely to be positive.\nPROTECTIONISM TO ENDURE\nKobsak Pootrakool, chairman of the Federation of Thai Capital Market Organizations, said he does not expect there to be much difference between the candidates in terms of US protectionism.\nRELATED\nthailand\nBare-knuckle politics\nthailand\nB300bn allocated for six double-track railway projects\n\"During the Biden administration, the trade war between the US and China did not ease, as tariff hikes and other trade barriers did not decrease,\" said Mr Kobsak, who is also senior executive vice-president of Bangkok Bank.\n\"The difference is Trump has an 'America First' policy, while Kamala Harris does not,\" he said.\nIn Mr Kobsak's view, the US is clearly being defeated by China in the tech war.\n\"If this continues, the US will lose more. That's why Washington has come out with several measures to disadvantage Beijing, while the US is still the world's No.1 economy,\" he said.\nChinese companies have been expanding their businesses into several countries, notably Vietnam and Thailand, said Mr Kobsak. These overseas production facilities not only serve the Chinese market, but also export to other markets worldwide.\n\"Even Mexico welcomes Chinese companies to set up manufacturing plants in the country, exporting to the US by using tax privileges under the North American Free Trade Agreement,\" he said.\nThe London-based Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) predicts Mr Trump to win according to its baseline forecast, noting he is likely to implement \"abrupt shifts in terms of the US position towards key international conflicts\", along with relations with traditional allies and the country's approach to global trade and climate policies as he pursues the America First agenda.\nThe diffusion of global power and uncertainty over the direction of US foreign policy underpins the rise in geopolitical risk, noted the EIU.\n\"We assess that China, Germany and Mexico will be among the more affected nations owing to their trade surpluses with the US and exposure to higher US tariffs,\" reported the think tank.\nEMERGING MARKETS MAY SUFFER\nTherdsak Thaveeteeratham, executive vice-president at Asia Plus Securities (ASPS), expressed concerns over possible negative impacts if Mr Trump wins the election.\nIf Mr Trump wins, it is widely anticipated the US corporate tax rate will be cut from 21% to 15% and America First policies will return, causing the US-China trade war to escalate, he said.\nIn addition, import tariffs on Chinese goods would be hiked to 150-200%, with global currencies fluctuating and US inflation running hot for longer, while US stock markets would rally, said Mr Therdsak.\n\"Mr Trump has talked about very high import tariffs,\" he said. \"If the trade war heats up, global trade will slow, affecting the Thai economy.\"\nMeanwhile, lower US corporate tax rates would boost the earnings of companies trading on US bourses, said Mr Therdsak.\n\"US market earnings grew strongly under the Trump administration,\" he said. \"When listed US companies perform well, it could limit fund outflows from US stock exchanges to emerging markets, including Thailand.\"\nAccording to ASPS, Thailand's exports may be affected by fiercer competition with China, especially for goods subject to US tariffs policies, such as petrochemicals, electric appliances, steel products and auto parts.\nNattawut Chanthanachulphong, strategist at Krungthai X Spring Securities, said the baht would continue its slide as the dollar strengthens if Mr Trump wins.\n\"If Mr Trump wins, the US government's massive spending is likely to cause US inflation to stay at a high level, making it harder for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates. That would continue to support the dollar's strength,\" said Mr Nattawut.\nMr Trump makes a point on Oct 23 during a campaign event held in Duluth, Georgia.\nCHINA STRATEGY TO PERSIST\nSompop Manarungsan, president of the Panyapiwat Institute of Management, said if Ms Harris wins, US economic policy towards Thailand, Asean, and even China would likely continue in the same direction as the past 3-4 years, with a focus on decoupling from China.\nHe said the US believes that without such a policy, China will become a rival economically, which would impact US security.\n\"If Ms Harris becomes president, the US would intensify its anti-China policies, especially concerning Chinese goods manufactured overseas, such as those produced in Thailand and then exported to the US,\" said Mr Sompop.\nFor instance, Thailand was recently sanctioned by the US over solar panels produced here by entities that received investment from Chinese companies.\nHowever, if the US imposes more sanctions on China, it could backfire, as many US-made products rely on the Chinese market, he said. For example, Intel depends on the Chinese market for up to 21% of its sales of chips and semiconductors.\nMr Sompop said Mr Trump would primarily focus on the economy, operating on a quid pro quo basis. For instance, if a country wants something from the US, it will need to offer something in return, even in matters of security.\nMr Trump recently threatened that if China invades Taiwan, the US would impose a 200% tariff on Chinese goods, showing that he is focused on business and the economy, said Mr Sompop.\n\"Mr Trump's approach is deal-making diplomacy. If the US benefits more, he will concede. His America First policy will persist if he becomes president,\" he said.\nMr Sompop said another Trump administration would seek to revive the US real sector, moving away from a reliance on the service and financial sectors. This shift could change the direction of global trade and investment.\nIf Mr Trump wants to revive US industries, Mr Sompop said his most effective tool would be raising tariffs to restrict imports, as he has said he is ready to impose an additional 10-20% tariff on nations with significant trade surpluses with the US, referring to a surplus of more than US$30 billion. Major competitors such as China may even face tariffs as high as 60%.\nIf these policies are implemented, they will disrupt the global supply chain, affecting trade, investment, production, and services such as logistics, he said.\n\"However, I believe this issue could be negotiated with Mr Trump regarding trade with the US. I think Mr Trump will not prioritise political and security issues as dominant factors in the way that Mr Biden does,\" said Mr Sompop.\nHARRIS POSES FEWER RISKS\nAmonthep Chawla, chief economist at CIMB Thai Bank, forecasts the Thai economy will face more opportunities and challenges next year if Mr Trump wins.\nMr Amonthep said Mr Trump's economic and trade policies could lead to greater uncertainty for the global, Asean and Thai economies next year compared with a Harris administration.\nSpecifically, Mr Trump's efforts to diminish China's economic influence may put pressure on trade and investment in the region, he said.\n\"Thai GDP growth for 2025 is projected to be 2.5% under a Trump presidency, in contrast with 3.2% under a Harris presidency. The intensifying US-China tensions under Mr Trump would adversely affect Thai exports,\" said Mr Amonthep.\n\"Should Mr Trump secure the election, Thailand's export growth is expected to reach only 1% next year, compared with 2.6% under Ms Harris.\"\nDomestic demand may also weaken based on falling commodity prices, particularly for rice, rubber and cassava, he said, adversely affecting the agricultural sector, particularly low-income households in rural areas, reducing their purchasing power.\nUnder a Trump presidency, Southeast Asian nations could attract foreign capital inflows, bolstered by both foreign direct investment and portfolio investments amid heightened US-China tensions, said Mr Amonthep.\nWith Mr Trump's proposed policy to raise trade tariffs against China to 60%, Thailand may benefit from a shift in manufacturing bases from the mainland, he said.\nMr Amonthep said Thailand is poised to become a manufacturing hub for Chinese investors across various industries, including electric vehicles (EVs), electronics, textiles and machinery.\nMs Harris speaks during a CNN town hall event on Oct 23 in Delaware County, Pennsylvania.\u2009photos by REUTERS\nFOREIGN POLICY\nAdith Chairattananon, honorary secretary-general of the Association of Thai Travel Agents, said the foreign policies of the new US president would influence Thailand's tourism industry.\nMr Trump has vowed to quickly end the Russia-Ukraine war even before returning to the White House early next year if he wins, while Ms Harris has pledged to back Ukraine and Nato.\nMr Adith said if the war ends, it would benefit the aviation and tourism industry worldwide.\nHe said transport globally would grow based on fewer flight restrictions, particularly if the Israel-Hamas conflict were to end quickly, as Mr Trump has said he wants.\nHowever, with a Trump administration, Mr Adith said tensions between the US and China may escalate as happened during his first term in the White House, while Ms Harris's policy towards China might not be as aggressive as the former president.\nMr Trump's America First policy will also likely trigger higher tax rates for Chinese imports, he said, weakening China's economy, which would hamper Thailand's tourism sector as tourists from the mainland remain an important source market.\nMr Adith said he believes tensions in the South China Sea and Taiwan Strait will not escalate into a new conflict regardless of the new US president. China will continue to carry out military drills off the coast of Taiwan, but these won't develop into an attack, he said.\nIn terms of US tourist arrivals, Mr Adith said the number of visitors from this market should remain stable and could reach 1 million, which the Tourism Authority of Thailand set as its target.\nOPPORTUNITIES AND THREATS\nSanan Angubolkul, chairman of the Thai Chamber of Commerce, said the US election presents both opportunities and challenges to the Thai economy in terms of trade, investment and environmental commitments.\nThailand's government and business sectors must adjust their strategies accordingly, such as strengthening economic relations with Southeast Asian nations and supporting domestic industry to reduce risks posed by US trade policy, he said.\nIf Mr Trump returns to the White House, Mr Sanan said he is likely to stop supporting Ukraine militarily, economically and politically.\nUS ground forces might be withdrawn from Europe, or the US could possibly leave Nato, he said.\nIn the Middle East, Mr Trump has promised to take a tougher approach aimed at curtailing the conflict.\nRegarding Iran, Mr Trump pushed for returning to a policy of putting maximum pressure on the Islamic republic, perhaps to generate a new agreement with Tehran, or to further constrain it, said Mr Sanan.\nMany leaders in the Middle East, including those from the Arabian peninsula, might welcome the return of a Trump presidency, but his America First policy did not provide Arab Gulf leaders, especially Riyadh, with protection from Iran's attack on Saudi oil facilities in 2019, he said.\nMoreover, Iran's recent missile and drone attacks against Israel led to rising oil prices and shipping delays, which threaten the Thai economy by increasing the rate of inflation and reducing exports.\nA policy of higher tariffs against China would hinder Chinese exports to the US, said Mr Sanan, and could spike cheap Chinese products entering Thailand, affecting the income of Thai manufacturers.\nIf Ms Harris wins the election, a continuation of the functioning transatlantic security relations and open trade policy under President Biden seems likely, he said.\nMs Harris might seek to revive US leadership in global trade, perhaps by joining the Comprehensive and Progressive Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), giving Thailand another opportunity to consider membership to expand trade opportunities, said Mr Sanan.\nThailand may benefit from investments in Industry 4.0 and technology transfer through an intensified partnership with CPTPP member states, he said.\nGiven Ms Harris's support for a clean energy economy, this may open opportunities for Thai companies with expertise in solar, wind and biomass for joint investments in the US.\nTRADE WAR\nIf Mr Trump wins the election, countries that export products to the US, including Thailand, may see significant tariffs placed on many products as a result of the trade war with China, said Kriengkrai Thiennukul, chairman of the Federation of Thai Industries.\nThe trade war erupted during the Trump administration, as he placed high tariffs on Chinese products in response to a years-long trade deficit with China.\n\"Mr Trump announced the US will not easily accept trade deficits with other countries either,\" said Mr Kriengkrai.\nAccording to the Council on Foreign Relations, a New York-based think tank, Mr Trump wants to \"impose a 'universal' tariff on most imports, while matching higher tariffs imposed by other countries\".\nThailand had a trade surplus of around $20 billion with the US in 2020. The value later increased by 11%, making Thailand the 12th-largest current account surplus holder with the US this year, said Mr Kriengkrai.\n\"I believe Thailand may see US tariffs on its exports of 10-20% if Mr Trump is elected president,\" he said.\nHowever, trade relations may ease if Ms Harris succeeds President Biden, said Mr Kriengkrai, as a Harris administration would only increase tariffs on certain products, such as EVs produced in China.\nCOSTLIER ENERGY\nRegardless of the next US president, global energy prices are likely to increase, driven by geopolitical conflicts in the Middle East, said Praipol Koomsup, an economist at Thammasat University and a former assistant to the energy minister.\nMr Praipol said he believes Israel's attacks on Hezbollah will continue.\nAccording to the Council on Foreign Relations, Mr Trump said he supports efforts to broker a regional peace deal, while Ms Harris called for an immediate cease-fire after Israel struck Hamas in Gaza following the group's attack on Israel on Oct 7, 2023.\n\"A protracted conflict will affect oil and liquefied natural gas [LNG] supply in the future,\" he said.\nThailand is a major importer of crude oil and LNG, which is used in power generation.\nLNG imports have increased despite price fluctuations as domestic gas supply from the Gulf of Thailand dwindles.\nGlobal crude oil prices are likely to range between $70-80 per barrel, but they could surge to $100 per barrel, said Mr Praipol.\nMolpasorn Shoowong, Phusadee Arunmas, Lamonphet Apisitniran and Yuthana Praiwan\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat is your budget range for purchasing a condominium?\nEkkamai-Thong Lor\nSathorn-Silom\nChidlom-Siam\nBang Na\nChinatown\nAri\nRiverside\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nThailand\nBusiness\nPolitics\nUS\nPresidential\nElection\nEconomic\nPolicy\n\u0e18\u0e38\u0e23\u0e01\u0e34\u0e08\n\u0e01\u0e32\u0e23\u0e40\u0e21\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e07\n\u0e2a\u0e2b\u0e23\u0e31\u0e10\u0e2f\n\u0e1b\u0e23\u0e30\u0e18\u0e32\u0e19\u0e32\u0e18\u0e34\u0e1a\u0e14\u0e35\n\u0e01\u0e32\u0e23\u0e40\u0e25\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e01\u0e15\u0e31\u0e49\u0e07\n\u0e40\u0e28\u0e23\u0e29\u0e10\u0e01\u0e34\u0e08\n\u0e19\u0e42\u0e22\u0e1a\u0e32\u0e22\nImpact\nDo you like the content of this article?\n8\n24\nCOMMENT\n(43)",

(Photo: Reuters)\nTOKYO - Voters in Japan could end more than a decade of Liberal Democratic Party dominance on Sunday, forcing the ruling party into power-sharing deals that could undermine the country\u2019s leadership.\nThe general election, nine days before the US chooses a new president, adds uncertainty to an already turbulent geopolitical landscape as the Tokyo government faces growing tensions with neighbouring China and inflation squeezes Japanese households.\nPrime Minister Shigeru Ishiba\u2019s conservative LDP, in government for almost all of the postwar era, has had a majority in the lower house of parliament since 2012, ruling in coalition with Komeito, on which it depends to control the less-powerful upper house.\nADVERTISEMENT\nAds powered by\nBut discontent over an LDP political funding scandal and a rising cost of living in the world\u2019s fourth-biggest economy threatens the ruling party.\nRELATED\nsports\nIshii's army ready to strike\nbusiness\nPolitical crisis threatens South Korea\u2019s tourism, soft power gains\n\u201cPublic anger has not subsided. The election is going to be very close for the LDP,\u201d said Tomoaki Iwai, professor emeritus at Nihon University and an expert on money in politics.\nAn opinion survey in the\nAsahi\nnewspaper on Monday suggested the party could lose as many as 50 of its 247 seats in the lower chamber and Komeito could slip to fewer than 30, putting the coalition below the 233 needed for a majority.\nThe LDP will remain easily the biggest force in parliament, but many votes could go to the number two party, the opposition Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, which toppled the LDP in 2009. The CDPJ could win 140 seats, the\nAsahi\nestimated.\nIf the LDP needs to rely on Komeito to form a government, that would give the junior partner more influence.\nKomeito, affiliated with Japan\u2019s biggest lay Buddhist organisation, has been reluctant to back decisions it sees as stepping away from Japan\u2019s postwar pacifism, such as acquiring the longer-range weapons the LDP argues are needed to deter China from starting a war in East Asia.\nPossible coalition scramble\nIf the coalition loses its majority, the LDP would need the backing of at least one other party, further hemming Ishiba in on policy and possibly complicating the Bank of Japan\u2019s efforts to unwind decades of monetary stimulus.\nPotential partners include the Democratic Party for the People (DPP), which had seven lower house lawmakers going into the election and advocates for lower taxes, and the conservative Japan Innovation Party, which is defending 44 seats with a pledge of tougher donation rules to clean up politics.\n\u201cA coalition with the DPP could happen, but the challenge would be to reconcile their push for tax cuts,\u201d said Masafumi Fujiwara, an associate professor at the University of Yamanashi.\nThe DPP wants to halve Japan\u2019s 10% national sales tax and cut income tax, policies not supported by the LDP.\nDPP party chief Yuichiro Tamaki has so far rejected the idea of working with an LDP-led coalition. Innovation Party head Nobuyuki Baba has not ruled out a partnership.\nOne option for Ishiba could be to reinstate lawmakers ousted from the LDP over the scandal who run as independents in constituencies where the party is not fielding candidates.\n\u201cSeveral of those questionable candidates are expected to win, and by officially endorsing them, the LDP might narrowly secure a single-party majority,\u201d said Tadashi Mori, a political science professor at Aichi Gakuin University.\nBut this would be risky for Ishiba. The scandal over undeclared donations at fundraisers is a factor most voters are weighing, according to the Asahi survey.\nFumio Kishida stepped down as prime minister last month over the scandal, though he was not implicated. Ishiba, hoping to seize on the change and solidify the LDP\u2019s hold on power, immediately called an election, but his popularity and the LDP\u2019s prospects have slid since he took office on Oct 1.\nSupport for his cabinet fell to 41% from 44% over a week, according to a poll published by the public broadcaster NHK on Monday.\nIf the LDP cannot form a governing coalition, the centre-left CDPJ could try to cobble together an administration from a patchwork of opposition parties. The party, led by former Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda, has ruled out forming a coalition with the LDP.\n\u201cIt would be very challenging to see the CDPJ forming a government with the other opposition parties, just given how different their policy views are,\u201d said Rintaro Nishimura, an associate at the Asia Group Japan consulting firm.\n\u201cPolitical instability actually comes in regardless of who wins.\u201d\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat type of house are you most interested in?\nSingle-family home\nTownhouse\nSemi-detached house\nVilla\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nJapan\nElection\nLDP\nShigeru Ishiba\nDo you like the content of this article?\n2\n1\nCOMMENT\n(1)",

The US central bank cut interest rates by 50 basis points to a range of 4.75% to 5.00%, amid signs of continued economic strength. Economic data for September showed remarkable resilience, with non-farm payroll growth exceeding expectations, while unemployment dropped to 4.1%. Inflation has reached a three-year low at 2.4%.\nNevertheless, some caution is in order. The Fed's latest Beige Book report paints a picture of an economy showing signs of a \"soft landing\", with most activities remaining stable amid modest increases in employment and prices, coupled with slowing wage growth.\nADVERTISEMENT\nBut the report also highlights a significant trend of consumers \"trading down\" to cheaper alternatives across multiple regions. This shift in purchasing behaviour reflects growing price sensitivity among American shoppers, who are increasingly reluctant to pay full price for non-essential items.\nDifferent metropolitan areas are also experiencing varied economic conditions. In New York, the restaurant businesses shows signs of decline while Broadway theatres have seen a recovery. In Philadelphia, credit demand is slowing as borrowers anticipate further rate cuts. In Chicago and San Francisco, consumers are actively seeking discounts and lower-priced alternatives. In Dallas, requests for assistance are increasing from elderly residents due to inflation pressures, with some forced to return to work.\nRELATED\nworld\nS.Korea's Yoon faces impeachment over short-lived martial law declaration\nbusiness\nStocks tipped to surge in US, Asia in 2025\nThe report indicates a notable slowdown in credit applications, as prospective borrowers await lower interest rates. This trend suggests pressure for faster rate cuts by the Fed.\nHowever, we caution that if former president Donald Trump wins the upcoming election and imposes his proposed tariff increases on imports, it could trigger renewed inflation pressures. This scenario might constrain the Fed's ability to cut rates as expected.\nDELICATE BALANCE\nThe overall report suggests a delicate economic balance, with consumers showing increased caution in spending and investment decisions. This cautious behaviour may influence the Fed to consider continued easing in the future, though political and inflation risks remain significant factors in the decision-making process.\nThe current economic indicators align with our soft-landing scenario. But we must remain vigilant about potential inflation risks and political uncertainties that could affect the monetary policy trajectory.\nSecond, China has unleashed a comprehensive stimulus package. An extensive series of monetary and fiscal measures have been announced to combat the economic slowdown. The monetary initiatives include reductions in seven-day reverse repo rates, medium-term lending facility rates, and long-term interest rates, alongside cuts to the reserve requirement ratio for commercial banks.\nA notable 800-billion-yuan stock market stabilisation fund has also been established, complemented by property sector stimulus measures.\nThe fiscal policy response has been equally robust, featuring accelerated government investment, special infrastructure bonds and support for local government financing. These measures come as China's GDP growth reached 4.6% year-on-year, bringing the nine-month figure to 4.8%, at the lower end of annual targets.\nWhile September data showed improvements in retail sales, electrical appliance and automotive sales, significant challenges persist. These include weakening exports, deflationary pressures and an unstable real estate market, in which new home prices have declined for 16 consecutive months.\nPOTENTIAL RISKS\nWhile Beijing's recent stimulus measures demonstrate the government's commitment to economic recovery, we highlight several significant concerns about their effectiveness and potential risks. Our first concern is local governments, which serve as crucial policy implementation vehicles but are grappling with overwhelming debt burdens. This financial strain could significantly hamper their ability to execute new initiatives effectively.\nOur second concern is the property sector, with many cities still facing substantial oversupply issues that complicate recovery efforts. Lastly, commercial banks may face increased risks as they become primary instruments for economic support measures.\nHowever, September's improved data, particularly the consumption and production metrics, could indicate early signs of recovery. These may partly reflect the impact of previous stimulus measures. Hence, we need to closely monitor China's economic trajectory to evaluate whether the stimulus measures will yield positive results.\nThird, Thailand has joined the easing trend. The Bank of Thailand has reduced its policy rate from 2.50% to 2.25%, responding to tight financial conditions and concerns over credit contraction. August economic indicators showed a broad slowdown, affecting tourism, industrial production and private investment, though agricultural exports showed some improvement.\nSeptember's inflation rate came in below expectations at 0.6%, while the Producer Price Index (PPI) contracted. The INVX Financial Condition Index has reached its tightest level in 16 years, influenced by a strong baht and record-high lending rates.\nAs for investment implications, we recommend four key investment strategies:\nCompanies with strong fundamentals and consistent profit growth.

But they are as under-resourced and poorly supported by national governments as at any time in their history. Their predicament is perhaps the clearest sign that economic and financial multilateralism is fragmenting along with the global economy. Worse, this fragmentation comes at a time of rising international tensions, financial fragility, sputtering growth, rising poverty, and mounting reconstruction bills in Gaza, Lebanon, Ukraine, and elsewhere.\nBoth institutions are led by individuals who grasp the urgent need for reform to meet today's challenges. Yet they lack sufficient support from their political masters: the largest share-holding countries whose votes are crucial for reform. To overcome the longstanding international coordination problems that have undermined reform efforts, we need a revamped G20 to take the lead. With its current chair, Brazil, it is well-placed to make significant progress.\nFinancial firepower is, of course, only one measure of the effectiveness of our multinational institutions, but it is an important one given the world we live in. The resources available to the IMF represent less than 1% (specifically 0.85%) of the global economy. Yet, as the lender of last resort and a financial safety net for the world, it is expected to deal with the problems of 191 member countries, as well as joining the global response to \"non-traditional\" and \"new\" issues such as climate change, gender disparities, and inequality.\nADVERTISEMENT\nSuch underfunding contradicts the intentions of the IMF's founders, led by the United Kingdom and the United States. At its creation, the Fund could draw on resources equal to roughly 3% of global GDP to help address a mere 44 countries' monetary and balance-of-payments problems. Since then, IMF membership has grown fourfold, yet its resources have declined by more than two-thirds relative to GDP. This erosion is reflected in the Fund's waning global heft and loss of capacity to solve tricky country cases.\nRELATED\nbusiness\nBitcoin passes $100,000 milestone\nbusiness\nHong Kong airport boosts efforts to lure foreign airlines as it waits on Cathay\nConsider the following examples. Four decades ago, in the seminal restructuring of Mexico's debt, the IMF promised one-third of what Mexico needed, on the expectation that commercial creditors would contribute the remainder. That financial capability then allowed it to press the private sector to accept a solution that traded off some of the creditors' contractual claims on Mexico for an improved outlook for financial viability.\nBy contrast, after Zambia defaulted in 2020, the IMF provided it with less than 10% of its financing needs. Despite such support, Zambia has struggled through four years of negotiations with creditors to finalise restructuring agreements. While part of the challenge reflects the changing composition of both private and public creditors, much of it also stems from the diminished effectiveness of the Fund's \"carrot and stick\" approach.\nA Dangerous World\nThis is no small challenge for an institution that also plays critical surveillance and technical assistance roles, serving as the anchor of the international financial safety net. There are reasons to worry that the kind of shocks we have been experiencing (from Covid-19 to the Ukraine and Gaza wars) will become even more frequent and violent in the years ahead, not least because of the climate challenge. The disturbing inadequacy of today's safety nets, especially for the most vulnerable countries and segments of society, is proving to be an additional source of fragility and instability.\nDespite these rising challenges, the IMF's resources remain below historical levels, and the most recent quota review failed to produce a net increase in its lending capacity. In fact, between March 2020 and March 2023, the IMF committed US$191 billion (and disbursed less than $75 billion) of its trillion-dollar resource base.\nThe Fund's surveillance role also faces major challenges. Framed as a crisis-prevention tool for both individual countries and the overall system, IMF surveillance has, over decades, failed to predict and correctly frame economic shocks. Admittedly, national policymakers have failed, too. Some failures are understandable, as in the case of the pandemic. But others, including the supply-chain disruptions and subsequent surge in inflation, could have been foreseen and subjected to better analysis. Such slippages support the case for new investments in a more effective system of surveillance.\nThe World Bank is even less adequately resourced for the additional climate responsibilities it has been given. In a report commissioned by the Indian G20 presidency last year, co-chairs Lawrence H Summers and N K Singh argued that multilateral development banks (MDBs) need to triple their lending by 2030 when it should be around $400 billion annually. Yet allocations to lower- and middle-income countries in 2023 were equivalent to just 0.07% of global GDP. The $73 billion earmarked for the World Bank in the 2023 fiscal year represented the smallest commitment to development in the institution's existence.\nWhat ails the IMF and the World Bank is not limited to these two institutions. We are witnessing a broader and increasingly worrisome breakdown in multilateralism -- and this at a time when the world's common problems can be solved only through coordination and common action.\nToday's MDBs, which include the regional development banks, provide loans equivalent to just 0.5% of developing countries' gross national income, down from a peak of 0.7% in the 1990s. Equally, the World Trade Organization struggles with an overly legalistic judge-based rulebook that was imposed on it at the height of neoliberalism in the 1990s. Its effectiveness has always hinged on negotiation, conciliation, and arbitration, but these approaches have taken a back seat to geopolitical rivalries and unilateralism in recent decades.\nThen there is the World Health Organization. Though the WHO's current replenishment target is $11 billion, only $4 billion has been guaranteed, and its annual budget is no larger than that of medium-size US hospitals. By denying the WHO the resources it needs while at the same time asking it to cover new health concerns, including well-being as a whole, we are depriving ourselves of the benefits of a global institution that finds it difficult to finance even its most basic tasks.\nFinally, the creation of the G20 was a welcome response to the realisation that the G7 no longer represented the face of global economic influence and power. By bringing together countries that account for around 80% of world GDP, the G20 had the best chance of helping us prevent or manage systemic crises like the one in 2008-10.\nYet despite its obvious potential, the G20 has operated without a structure to ensure continuity and effectiveness. And because its members include Russia and China, the US still prefers to work through the G7, which Jake Sullivan, the current national security adviser, sees as \"the steering committee of the free world\", even though G7 countries now represent only 43% of world GDP.\nA sweeping approach to reforming the world's multilateral institutions -- often presented under the banner of \"Bretton Woods 2.0\" -- is unlikely to get off the ground. But incremental progress is possible. Initiative by initiative, it could develop into a critical mass that would be welfare-enhancing for many, if not most, countries and people.\nThe WTO, for example, should focus on leveraging the undeniable skills of its current director-general, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, to solve trade disputes through conciliation, arbitration, and negotiation. That would mark a move away from its overly legalistic and now broken, judge-based appeal system.\nSimilarly, the IMF, led by an equally charismatic managing director, can enhance its contributions to crisis prevention and resolution by leaning into its role as a global early-warning system. That also means responding to any future crisis with more financial firepower and by mobilising lending capacity to enhance resilience against economic shocks, to negotiate a much-improved sovereign-debt restructuring mechanism, and thus to create a more comprehensive global financial safety net with limited conditionality in situations of large exogenous shocks.\nWhile high-income countries have borrowing capacity and reserves to weather most shocks, some emerging markets do not, and low-income countries are even more exposed, given their limited reserves and high vulnerability to losing access to financial markets. Faced with the threat of sovereign defaults and a lost decade of development, too many indebted countries have sought alternative ways to avoid what they view as overly harsh conditions imposed by multilateral lenders. But to avoid defaulting, many governments have reallocated their health and education spending. Tragically, 3.3 billion people now live in countries that spend more on interest payments than on these two basic services.\nThe Bretton Woods institutions also need to support developing countries' urgent climate mitigation and adaptation needs. Failure to do so would not only jeopardise tens of millions of people's well-being; it also would have negative cross-border spillovers, including through migration pressures. Both organizations have taken some steps to meet developing countries' (excluding China) need for $1 trillion of annual external funding by 2030. For example, the World Bank has arranged for \"catastrophe bonds\" to assist countries devastated by the increasing number of natural disasters, and the IMF has introduced a Resilience and Sustainability Trust as a lending window that is resourced through voluntary reallocations of Special Drawing Rights (SDRs, the IMF's reserve asset). But these interventions are not enough.\nTo be sure, the World Bank now directs 41% of its lending to climate-related projects, and its new mission statement refers to \"a liveable planet\". But without a significant increase in its overall resources, this new focus on climate change could come at the expense of investments in human capital and its traditional development work, unless wealthy countries put up more money. There are no shortcuts.\nThe key to revitalising the world's multilateral institutions is to reform their governance to reflect the enormous shifts in the configuration of the global economy over the past few decades. The shareholding structure of the IMF and the World Bank and the outmoded process of allocating top jobs according to nationality are no longer in step with current realities.\nEven today, 59.1% of voting shares in the IMF are held by countries representing just 13.7% of the world's population. India and China are the world's two most systemically important and influential emerging economies, yet their combined share is only 9%. Without a change here, an institution that is supposed to address the world's biggest economic and financial problems will face growing doubts about its legitimacy, fairness, and effectiveness by most of the Global South.\nMore needs to be done, and quickly, to deal with excessive debt and debt-service costs in the 79 low- and middle-income countries that are deemed to be in debt distress or at high risk of it. The situation demands a plan for comprehensive, sustainable, and incentive-aligned debt relief, including through re-profiling existing loans, debt swaps, and credit guarantees.\nFirst, IMF member states should strengthen the Fund's capacity to provide otherwise well-managed debt-distressed countries regular annual allocations of its \"in-house\" financial instrument.\nAlthough $650 billion in SDRs were allocated in 2021, only $21 billion went to the lowest-income countries that were most in need of help. The rules for SDR allocations need to be fundamentally revised and redistribution made more automatic if this channel is to be used more effectively to counter future systemic shocks.\nSecond, making the Common Framework for Debt Treatments work better will require closer cooperation with China's government and private creditors. Both carrots and sticks need to be revamped. The alternative of protracted negotiations, side deals, and incomplete restructuring often produces only limited benefits, and it is open to abuse. In addition to delaying comprehensive solutions, such temporary fixes can complicate the next round of restructurings.\nThird, the IMF needs to address the perceived lack of fairness in the conditions that it requires poorer countries to meet when seeking relief. Fortunately, the managing director is clearly aware of the need to lower the punitive interest rates charged to middle-income countries. In 2020, ten countries faced surcharges to the IMF, yet by 2023, that figure had more than doubled, reaching 22, owing to the impact of the pandemic, the conflict in Ukraine, and rising interest rates.\nOn top of that, the IMF's basic lending rate soared from below 1% to nearly 5%, pushing the overall rate for countries incurring surcharges as high as 7.8%. The IMF's recently launched review of its surcharge policy now provides a platform for changes that would not undermine its preferred creditor status.\nFinally, as a preventive measure, governments need to come together to establish an equitable global financial safety net. As Masood Ahmed, president emeritus of the Center for Global Development, has argued, there should be \"a separate identifiable IMF facility that would be triggered by a defined systemic shock and provide resources to all emerging markets and low-income countries in good standing\" without the penalties of excessively priced surcharges.\nAs for the World Bank, its dynamic president, Ajay Banga, has started his term with a determination to reform and is on the right track in launching a Liveable Planet Fund focused on human capital and environmental stewardship. But this initiative needs more resources, and Banga has justifiably called for the largest-ever replenishment of the International Development Association, which provides concessional loans and grants to the poorest countries.\nGiven the rising number of global poor -- now at 700 million -- we cannot settle for less. The Summers/Singh G20 report not only calls on MDBs to provide an additional $260 billion per year but also urges expanded use of innovative financial tools such as guarantees, risk-mitigation instruments, and hybrid capital.\nGiven that the G7 cannot, in fact, be the permanent steering committee for a world economy in which its members have a minority share, the G20 should become what it was intended to be: the premier forum for global economic cooperation, including when it comes to promoting the reform of the multilateral institutions.\nBut that will require a more representative system to offer smaller countries a role in a constituency-based framework, as well as a professional secretariat to ensure continuity from year to year.\nThe Brazilian G20 presidency has already laid out three key priorities for the November meeting: fighting hunger, poverty, and inequality; promoting sustainable development; and pursuing global governance reform. All three goals could pave the way for a new decade of improved cooperation, with the third in particular offering a welcome opportunity to overcome the inter-country coordination problems that have frustrated the necessary changes at the IMF and World Bank. We know what needs to happen and why. If well managed, this G20 could provide the sought-after \"how\".\nMassive revisions to the international system come about only after a complete breakdown of the current order. Hence, the post-1918 Versailles system arose after five dynastic empires collapsed and shattered into dozens of new nation-states; the post-1945 architecture followed the defeat of Germany, Italy, and Japan; and what US President George H W Bush called a liberal \"new world order\" had to wait until the collapse of the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact.\nThe urgent challenge today is to achieve the transition to a fifth world order without weathering a damaging breakdown. Such an order must account for the global realignment of economic and political power, especially the ambitions of the Global South. And it must be not only stable and fair, but also sustainable and open to effective collective action.\nTwo paths are open to us. One leads towards ever more global fragmentation and deepening crises, while the other offers a chance to pursue both individual and shared prosperity through joint solutions to common problems. The choice seems crystal clear.\n\u00a9Project Syndicate 1995\u20132024\nGordon Brown, an ex-prime minister of the UK, is UN Special Envoy for Global Education and Chair of Education Cannot Wait.

The apparent dispatch of elite North Korean military units to fight alongside Russian troops in Ukraine appears at first surprising but actually is quite logical given the historic and comradely ties between Pyongyang and Moscow. After all, North Korea's isolated Kim Jong-un regime has forged increasingly close ties with Vladimir Putin's Russia and the cash-strapped North Koreans have shipped more than eight million 122mm and 152mm artillery shells to Russia during in the past year.\nThe story goes back to the mists of WWII and the close political and military links between Stalin's Soviet Union and various Korean communist factions fighting the Japanese. Many Koreans had fled to the Soviet Far East and had come under the patronage of the Soviet military. Many would formally join the Red Army; one such Korean was Kim Il-sung, a loyal and unquestioning Red Army Captain personally selected by Stalin to rule what would become the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), aka North Korea, in 1948.\nWhile there were many Korean partisan factions fighting the Japanese, one was pro-Chinese communist, others nationalist, and others pro-Soviet; it was Kim's faction which had Stalin's blessing and was given the mandate to rule the DPRK. Though Moscow was influential in creating the DPRK, this move did not mitigate communist China's strong and competing influence on the peninsula from day one. Historically, China saw itself as the \"Big Brother\" and protector of the Korean people, whether they liked it or not.\nADVERTISEMENT\nSouth Korea's National Intelligence Service (NIS) has confirmed the \"beginning of the North's direct involvement\" in the Ukraine war, after having discovered that North Korean troops had embarked on Russian Navy transport ships. The NIS later stated that 1,500 North Korean troops were transported to Russia between Oct 8-13. A Seoul intelligence source was quoted saying that North Korea is expected to deploy a total of 12,000 troops, including those from the country's most elite military units, to the war in Ukraine.\nRELATED\nopinion\nChronicling the crumbling of the House of Assad\nbusiness\nThai stock index continues its downward trend\nThe North Korean troops deployed to Russia have been stationed across various locations in the Far East, including Vladivostok and Khabarovsk, where they are currently integrated with Russian military units, according to NIS. The North Koreans have been issued Russian uniforms, fake IDs, and weapons.\nBut will these units become cannon fodder to replace ill-motivated Russian conscripts or shall hardened and tough North Koreans work together as cohesive combat units to fulfil specific missions? Recall Chechen militia units fought effectively in the early stage of Moscow's invasion.\nSouth Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol and Nato chief Mark Rutte agreed that North Korea's military support for Russia in Ukraine escalates regional tensions and threatens global peace.\nFor Pyongyang, this becomes a win-win as it follows secret defence cooperation deals made in June this year between Mr Putin and Mr Kim. North Korea will probably get paid handsomely, Moscow does not have to explain North Korean losses to Russian mothers, and the DPRK People's Army gets genuine combat experience they have not had since the Korean War.\nKeep in mind that North Korean soldiers are always marching and drilling, and their aged generals are bedecked in medals from a war that ended 70 years ago. A Ukraine deployment offers serious combat experience in the tough living conditions the North Korean troops are accustomed to. Moreover, they may not necessarily be assigned frontline fighting duties but rather combat engineering and logistics tasks.\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky cited intelligence reports indicating that North Korean personnel have already been deployed in Russian-occupied Ukrainian territories.\nIt's significant to recall that during the 1980s, the North Koreans sent military units to assist various African left-wing regimes. Indeed, in many African states, including Libya, North Korean units were used as Pretorian guards to protect unpopular regimes and to effectively counter domestic resistance.\nSeoul's Korea Times added, \"Kim Jong-un's gamble; For Kim Jong-un, the troop deployment to Russia is a high-stakes poker game.\"\nThe deployment to Ukraine equally signals a high-profile power projection for the isolated DPRK and underscores a political shift that Mr Kim's regime can rock the geopolitical order with ballistic missiles and military meddling. Over the decades, Pyongyang's regime has cynically played a balancing act between Beijing and Moscow; in recent years, Mr Putin's Russia is in the ascendancy.

(File photo: Reuters)\nSINGAPORE - For decades, China has sought to maintain influence among armed ethnic groups in Myanmar in lawless border areas while also providing support to military leaders in charge of the Southeast Asian nation. An attack on its consulate last week shows that balancing act is becoming untenable.\nChina has demanded an investigation and lodged \"serious protests\" with the Myanmar authorities after its consulate in Mandalay, the country\u2019s second-largest city, was hit on Friday with an explosive device \u2014 reportedly a grenade. It\u2019s unclear who was responsible for the incident, which was quickly condemned by the junta and pro-democracy forces.\nBoth sides have been angered by recent actions from China under President Xi Jinping. Min Aung Hlaing, whose overthrow of the civilian government led by Aung San Suu Kyi in 2021 renewed a civil war, signalled his annoyance with Beijing after it appeared last year to back rebel groups in an operation to clear out scam centres taking advantage of Chinese citizens.\nADVERTISEMENT\nAds powered by\nThe success of that offensive raised the possibility that Min Aung Hlaing's regime could collapse, and the armed ethnic groups would take control of Myanmar. Faced with that scenario, China began exerting more pressure on the rebels to stick to their sphere of influence in the northern areas of the country, backing the government in a move to ensure the nation didn\u2019t devolve into chaos.\nRELATED\nworld\nUS and China swap prisoners\nopinion\nLike bamboo swaying in the wind\n\"While it's no fan of this regime, it definitely doesn't want a disorderly kind of collapse of power in Naypyidaw because it doesn't know what comes next,\" Richard Horsey, senior Myanmar adviser with the International Crisis Group, said of China. \"It worries that would be even worse,\" he added. \"Unpredictable kinds of outcomes are not what they want.\"\nIn additional to its losses in the north, recent reports show the junta is on the verge of being expelled from the western-most state bordering Bangladesh, while others show it has lost control of townships covering about 86% of the country, raising questions over how long the generals can retain power.\nIn early August, Min Aung Hlaing's forces suffered one of their most significant military defeats yet with the loss of Lashio, the capital of the northern Shan State. That potentially opens the way for an assault on Mandalay, which is connected by highway to Naypyidaw, the capital, and Yangon, the nation's biggest city.\n\"If successful, such an operation would open an avenue for attacks on the capital at Naypyidaw, posing an existential threat to the regime,\" reads an assessment published this month by the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies. \"The recent fall of Lashio has placed the Myanmar military in its most vulnerable position since the 2021 coup.\"\nWhether an attack on Mandalay happens, and which groups would be involved, is unclear. Observers, however, point to sporadic gains in the region by forces loyal to a parallel government set up by ousted lawmakers.\nThe alliance of ethnic-armed groups in the north began to make real progress last October, when it routed junta forces from some key strongholds. The \u201cThree Brotherhood Alliance,\u201d as they are known, also sought to eradicate cybercrime syndicates operating in the area that had been siphoning billions of dollars from Chinese citizens since the Covid-19 pandemic. Working in tandem with Chinese authorities, the groups helped transfer tens of thousands of suspects back across the border to China.\nThe military\u2019s nationalist backers soon hit the streets to protest China's perceived support. Min Aung Hlaing himself used speeches to rail against unnamed foreign countries for supporting his enemies with food, money and other provisions \u2014 clear references to China, which has long pledged to maintain a non-interference stance in Myanmar\u2019s domestic affairs.\nAs the rebel groups gained strength, China moved to broker a cease-fire in January that fell apart only months later. Once the ethnic army began overrunning junta positions further south, those groups say Beijing started using economic coercion and vague threats of retribution to halt their advance.\n\"The Chinese government has pressured us to stop fighting and not make any offensive moves,\" Lway Yay Oo, spokesman of Ta'ang National Liberation Army active in Shan State, told\nBloomberg News\n. China has since imposed travel restrictions in the areas they control and restricted border trade including access to pharmaceuticals, she said.\nAsked in an August briefing if China told the group to stop fighting, Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian didn\u2019t answer directly, saying that Xi's government has been working to promote a cease-fire.\n\"As Myanmar's biggest neighbouring country, China has all along sincerely hoped that Myanmar will achieve stability and development, and has worked actively to this end,\" he told reporters. \"China will continue to play a constructive role for Myanmar's peace and reconciliation process and promote the de-escalation in northern Myanmar.\"\nDuring a recent summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations in Laos, Myanmar's neighbours expressed frustration that efforts to stop the violence have failed. Singapore Prime Minister Lawrence Wong called on partner nations like China to \"lean forward\" and pressure Myanmar authorities to end the war.\nChina has recently ramped up public engagements with the junta. Its top diplomat, Foreign Minister Wang Yi, touted the longstanding \"pauk-phaw friendship\" between the two countries \u2014 a phrase Chinese officials say means \u201cbrothers born together\" \u2014 in August talks with Min Aung Hlaing. The junta chief is reportedly set to travel to China next month in what would be his first known trip there since the coup.\nA visit from Min Aung Hlaing to meet officials in Beijing \"will be a clear policy pivot from China,\" according to Horsey of the International Crisis Group. \"If he was to meet Xi Jinping, that would be an even more significant move. So, China's trying to undo the damage.\"\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat is your budget range for purchasing a condominium?\nUnder 2 million THB\n2 million - 4 million THB\n4 million - 7 million THB\n7 million - 10 million THB\nOver 10 million THB\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nXi jinping\nChina\nMyanmar\nJunta\nViolence\nMin Aung Hlaingm\nAsean\nDo you like the content of this article?\n6\n37\nCOMMENT",

(Photos: Reuters)\nThe presidential race between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris comes at a time of rising geopolitical tensions on multiple fronts.\nEven as the United States presidential election draws near, both the Democratic and Republican candidates have remained largely silent on Southeast Asia - a region Washington has been eager to court amid its rivalry with Beijing.\nWhile their strategies for the region are expected to be similar, analysts see Kamala Harris taking a more \"personal\" approach and paying more attention to issues like the South China Sea. Donald Trump might be more assertive on the disputed waterway - potentially worsening tensions and increasing the risk of confrontation with China.\nADVERTISEMENT\nAds powered by\nJames Downes, head of politics and public administration at Hong Kong Metropolitan University, expected a future Harris administration to continue existing policies, involving a combination of diplomacy, multilateralism and a focus on human rights and liberal democracy.\nRELATED\nopinion\nNo more bailouts\nthailand\nBIG and Delta Pioneer the First Low-Carbon Nitrogen  in Thailand's Electronics Industry\nHe said Trump's approach was likely to be about the economy, with an emphasis on trade deals and security pacts that directly benefit the US.\nThe former president would be \"more transactional\" when dealing with US allies in the region including the Philippines, prioritising areas of mutual interest with less focus on human rights issues, he said.\n\"A security focus would also underpin a Trump 2.0 presidency, where Trump would likely prioritise security cooperation with countries in the region to counter increased Chinese economic influence and to maintain the US' power in the wider region,\" Downes said.\n\"From a policy perspective, Kamala Harris is most likely to place greater focus and attention on the region.\"\nSimilarly, David Arase, resident professor of international politics with the Hopkins-Nanjing Centre, expected Harris to maintain the current foreign and security policy direction with only \"marginal changes\" in her approach.\nHe said Trump, while not an isolationist, was an \"America firster\" - meaning he would focus on threats and opportunities that affect the country's interests. Trump would likely value those aligned with American interests and may view the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) \"as irrelevant to US aims and interests\" given its \"disparate membership\".\nDuring his term as US president, Trump pushed for an \"America first\" approach to foreign policy and trade which saw a focus on reducing US trade deficits and a disengagement in global affairs.\nOn the economic front, Harris is expected to represent continuity from the current administration while a second Trump term could see a return of tensions over US trade deficits with countries in the region, according to Andreyka Natalegawa, an associate fellow for the Southeast Asia Programme at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.\nHe said Harris could bring a \"more personal approach to the region\" given her record of travelling to Southeast Asia. Trump, in contrast, skipped several regional summits including Asean meetings during his time in office.\nAli Wyne, a senior research and advocacy adviser at the International Crisis Group, said Harris had signalled an \"active interest\" in Southeast Asia, including through trips to Thailand for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in 2022 and to Indonesia for last year's Asean summit.\nThe vice-president emphasised Washington's commitment to Southeast Asia at that summit, saying in an interview that the US had a \"very significant interest \u2026 in developing and strengthening\" ties with the region.\nWyne expected Harris to build on the Joe Biden administration's efforts to strengthen Washington's diplomatic network in Asia, noting her six meetings with the Philippine president since he took office - the most she has met with a world leader.\nOn the flip side, Trump's \"America first\" world view \"makes him suspicious of US allies and partners, which he believes exploit US generosity\", he said.\nAccording to Fei-Ling Wang, an international affairs professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology, there might not be a big difference in policies between the two candidates but Harris might be \"more attentive and more likely to have a multilateral approach than Trump\".\n\"I think Harris is likely to pay more attention to the US allies in the region, the Philippines especially,\" he said. \"The US military, for example, is poised to assist Manila increasingly more.\"\nTensions between the Philippines and China have spiked in recent months over their territorial disputes in the South China Sea, with frequent confrontations. China's sweeping claims to most of the strategic waterway overlap with those of the Philippines and several other Southeast Asian nations.\nFaced with an increasingly assertive China, the Philippines appears to have drawn closer to the US during the Biden administration. Biden has said that Washington would defend treaty ally Manila in the event of an attack in the South China Sea.\nUS President Joe Biden shakes hands with Indonesia's President Joko Widodo as Cambodia's Prime Minister Hun Sen stands at the&nbsp;Asean-US&nbsp;summit during the&nbsp;Asean&nbsp;summit held in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, on Nov 12, 2022. (Photo: Reuters)\nWang said there was a high degree of bipartisan consensus in Washington on the South China Sea, but noted there were still \"tactical but meaningful differences\" on policy between Harris and Trump.\nHe expected Harris to continue the Biden administration's push to build alliances as part of a methodical and comprehensive strategy.\n\"Trump seems to be more likely a unilateralist and less predictable especially in terms of 'disruptive' rhetoric if not action,\" he said. \"Both, though, are likely to play a mostly passive 'responding' role in the region.\"\nDownes at HKMU said Harris was likely to pursue a \"more diplomatic and rules-based approach\" to the South China Sea disputes and prioritise dialogue and cooperation.\nHe said Trump \"might be more assertive and security-focused, potentially heightening tensions with China in the region\".\n\"Harris' policies could lead to a more stable and predictable environment in the South China Sea, whereas Trump's approach might increase the likelihood of geopolitical confrontations and escalations, impacting overall regional stability and economic relations with China,\" he added.\nZhou Bo, a senior fellow at the Centre for International Security and Strategy at Tsinghua University in Beijing, said Harris would likely inherit Biden's policies.\nHe said that US national security adviser Jake Sullivan's visit to China in August sent a clear signal that there would be a continuation of existing policies if the Democrats won the election.\nAs for Trump, Zhou said the former president's future policies remained an unknown - though he could continue some of Biden's favourable policies. \"Trump doesn't have any consideration for foreign policy \u2026 he only cares about whether he gets elected, and the rest can wait,\" he said.\nAccording to Dylan Loh, an assistant professor of foreign policy at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore, neither presidential candidate can afford to ignore the region - especially given the economic and geopolitical shift towards Asia.\n\"Any American president must pay attention to this part of the world if he or she is serious about protecting America's national interests,\" he said.\nLoh said Harris' policy on Asia was not likely to depart significantly from Biden's and that would bring more continuity and stability. He said Trump appeared more focused on domestic issues and prioritising his so-called America first agenda.\nUnited States Vice President Kamala Harris visits Or Tor Kor farm market in Chatuchak district, Bangkok, in November 2022. (Photo: Apichart Jinakul)\n\"While that doesn't mean [the candidates will be] completely ignoring Southeast Asia, there are questions raised about America's commitment [to the region],\" he added.\nAndrew Scobell, a distinguished fellow for China at the United States Institute of Peace, said Washington had not given adequate attention to Southeast Asia in the past, but that changed as US-China competition intensified.\nHe did not expect a \"dramatic difference\" on policy towards the region between Harris and Trump, including on the South China Sea.\n\"The bipartisan consensus view in Washington is that China has become far more aggressive in the South China Sea and the United States must stand up to Chinese provocations and stand by its allies and friends in maritime Southeast Asia,\" Scobell said.\nNatalegawa from the CSIS expected both candidates to frame their foreign policy in the context of the deepening US-China rivalry, meaning Southeast Asia would play a crucial role.\n\"No matter who wins in November, the next administration faces a few clear priorities in the next year - shoring up relations with key allies and partners, managing tensions in the South China Sea, and presenting a positive economic agenda for the region,\" he said.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat type of hotel location do you prefer in Thailand?\nBeachfront resorts\nCity-center hotels (close to shopping, restaurants, attractions\nSecluded, nature retreats\nNear airports for convenience\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nUnited states\nAsean\nSoutheast asia\nEconomy\nDonald trump\nKamala harris\nElections\nDo you like the content of this article?\n8\n21\nCOMMENT\n(68)",

This year the company plans to release nine BL and two GL series.\nGMMTV initially focused on BL storylines, with GL stories often having a secondary role.\nHowever, the company developed two GL series in 2024 -- 23.5 When the Earth is Spinning Around, which aired earlier this year, and Pluto, which is currently on air.\nHe said GL audiences seek high-quality productions featuring diverse plots, innovative storytelling and healthy relationships.\nTo build on the success of the GL genre, GMMTV hosted fan events in Thailand and overseas, with merchandise sales exceeding expectations, said Mr Noppharnach.\nThe company organised a fan meeting in Taiwan in June, featuring \"Milk\" and \"Love\", the two actresses featured in 23.5 When the Earth is Spinning Around. Tickets sold out quickly, attracting both Taiwanese and foreign fans.\n\"The Yuri [GL] series market is in its infancy, and we believe GMMTV's GL production volume will increase in the future,\" he said.\nAs the markets for BL and GL content continue to expand, the company plans to collaborate with other production companies and studios to increase its output.\nMr Noppharnach said there are currently around 17 BL and GL series airing weekly in Thailand.\nEmbracing diversity\nMs Chanettee, who is also a member of a committee organised by the Sexuality Studies Association, recommends media producers include themes pertaining to gender equality in a natural way in their storylines, urging them to avoid presenting a dichotomy.\nShe also encouraged producers to show more diverse LGBTQ characters, such as those living in rural areas, migrants, and people in unique jobs in order to better reflect diversity.\nLast year, GMMTV produced Midnight Series: Moonlight Chicken, a BL series focused on a restaurant owner who is burdened by debt and strives to ensure the business survives, said Mr Noppharnach.\nMs Chanettee said for TV and film productions, the roles of LGBTQ and straight characters should be open to everyone, no matter their sexual orientation or gender identity.\n\"In a truly diverse society, everyone has the right to be anyone,\" she said.\nCall for state support\nPubat feels there is room for the popularity of GL novels to grow both domestically and internationally, as the market has not yet reached its saturation point, said Mr Theerapat.\nThe association expects sales of GL novels to keep expanding in the domestic market, with the proportion of overseas sales also increasing in the future.\nMarkets that hold potential for Thai GL novels are Japan, Taiwan, China, the Philippines and Vietnam, he said.\n\"Some countries might have religious restrictions such as Indonesia and South American nations, posing a formidable challenge for Thai publishers of BL and GL novels,\" said Mr Theerapat.\nBefore BL and GL novels become popular, the first move is often adaptation into a TV series, he said.\nIf the TV series proves popular, sales of the novels can surge, said Mr Theerapat.\nHowever, Pubat plans to promote BL and GL novels overseas, seeking large book sales that can draw the interest of TV series and movie producers from international studios, he said.\nFollowing recent celebrations after the same-sex marriage bill passed in Thailand, Pubat believes Thai LGBTQ-related content offers great growth potential if it is supported by the government.\nMr Theerapat said the government could play a major role in supporting the creative industry by promoting such Thai content in the international market.\nThe government could help the LGBTQ content industry by subsidising the cost of overseas exhibitions or business-matching events, as well as establishing a focal agency to sell content in the international market, he said.\nA poster promotes 'Pluto', a Girls' Love series on GMMTV.\nMr Theerapat says the publication of GL novels such as '23.5 When the Earth is Spinning Around' and their TV series adaptations should drive their popularity.\nNoppharnach: TV series air weekly\nTheerapat: Demand overseas is strong\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat is your preferred price range per night for accommodation in Bangkok?\n1,000 - 3,000 THB\n3,000 - 5,000 THB\n5,000 - 8,000 THB\nOver 8,000 THB\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nThailand\nBusiness\nPopularity\nLGBTQ+\nTV shows\nRomance\nBoys' Love\nBL\nY series\n\u0e18\u0e38\u0e23\u0e01\u0e34\u0e08\n\u0e04\u0e27\u0e32\u0e21\u0e19\u0e34\u0e22\u0e21\n\u0e23\u0e32\u0e22\u0e01\u0e32\u0e23\u0e17\u0e35\u0e27\u0e35\n\u0e42\u0e23\u0e41\u0e21\u0e19\u0e15\u0e34\u0e01\nSeries\nProgrammes\nTV\nDo you like the content of this article?\n14\n56\nCOMMENT\n(5)",

He was also inspired by Islamic State propaganda which glorified suicide knife attacks, which eventually led to his plan.\nBefore his planned attack in Singapore, the teen also intended to travel to Syria to join Islamic State and engage in armed violence.\nWhile he did not have any specific timeline for his travel, he did reach out to an online contact based in Syria for advice, and researched flight routes there.\n\"While he was against National Service (NS) as he did not wish to serve a secular, and therefore, in his view, a kuffar [infidel] government, he would still go through NS if enlisted as he saw it as a potential avenue to equip himself with military and combat skills to aid him in fighting in Syria,\" ISD said.\nTo prepare himself, he also downloaded materials from an extremist magazine which contained tips on planning an attack or conducting a roadside ambush.\nUp until his arrest, the youth continued to see his plan to fight in Syria as an \"important and meaningful endeavour\", as he would be able to fight and die alongside fellow Islamic State fighters to help establish an Islamic state in Syria, ISD said.\nBut he also acknowledged it would be difficult to travel to Syria without arousing suspicions from his family.\n\"This contributed to his decision to plan an attack in Singapore, which he felt would be easier to carry out and fulfil his aspirations to be a martyr,\" ISD added.\nThe youth also sought to propagate his beliefs by actively sharing on social media radical materials promoting armed jihad, including chants by Islamic State.\n\"He admitted that he wanted to influence his followers into hating non-Muslims and believing that it was acceptable to kill them,\" ISD said.\nHe also frequently shared segregationist beliefs, such as advising Muslims not to interact with non-Muslims or participate in non-Muslim festivals.\nISD investigations thus far found that the youth was unsuccessful in radicalising his followers or contacts, and that he acted alone.\nHis family and friends were unaware of his plans to conduct an attack in Singapore or engage in armed violence in Syria, the agency said.\nHowever, his parents had noticed him watching videos of foreign preachers and advised him against it, saying the material may not be suitable for Singapore's context. But the student paid no heed.\nInstead, he took steps to conceal his activities, such as using code words when discussing his radical beliefs online and virtual private networks when surfing radical websites, ISD said.\nThe agency noted that this latest case underscores the trend of youth radicalisation seen in recent years.\nAnd such radicalisation - which usually takes place online - can occur within a short span of a few months.\nISD also pointed to the growing threat of lone-actor attacks against soft targets, using simple and easily accessible weapons, as Islamic State and other terrorist groups call on their followers to mount attacks wherever they are located.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat hotel facilities are most important to you when choosing accommodation?\nSwimming pool\nFitness center\nRestaurants and bars\nMassage and spa\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nSingapore\nSecurity\nAsean\nTerrorism\nTeen\nIslam\nIslamic State\nDo you like the content of this article?\n39\n3\nCOMMENT\n(6)",

The average tariffs on goods traded between these two nations have increased significantly, contributing to a decline in trade volume.\nThe Russian invasion of Ukraine further exacerbated geopolitical tensions, leading to a dramatic collapse in trade between Russia and Western countries. This conflict not only disrupted direct trade, but also prompted a reconfiguration of supply chains, with countries aligning their trade policies based on geopolitical proximity.\nADVERTISEMENT\nGeopolitical alignment is increasingly dictating trade relationships. Countries are forming blocs based on shared interests, leading to a decrease in trade between geopolitically distant nations.\nKEY FACTOR\nRELATED\nbusiness\nAuto sales rut in Thailand to drag on for years\nlife\nArt highlights at Jim Thompson Farm\nBenjarong Suwankiri, senior executive vice-president of the Export-Import Bank of Thailand, said geopolitics has become a crucial factor in strategic planning.\nThis discussion is not limited to management, but is also happening in boardrooms, focusing on how to develop strategies, he said.\n\"Conflicts in various regions around the world pose 'country risks', affecting debt repayment capabilities and exchange rates in countries involved in geopolitical issues, or those that are vulnerable to such situations,\" said Mr Benjarong.\n\"The Russia-Ukraine conflict and tensions in the Middle East are affecting international shipping, raising costs related to trade and investment.\"\nFor Thailand, where exports account for around 60% of GDP and tourism another 10%, conflicts in various regions across the globe can have an adverse impact on the country, he said.\nAccording to Mr Benjarong, geopolitics is a critical factor in determining how external environments impact Thai businesses and the economy. No one knows how long this balancing act will last, he said.\nTECHNOLOGY WAR\n\"The nature of the conflict has shifted from a trade war to a technology war between the US, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and the Netherlands, which have allied, and China, which is striving to develop its technology and catch up, in particular producing semiconductors smaller than 5 nanometres,\" said Mr Benjarong.\n\"This technology war has led to a supply chain war and decoupling, with the relocation of production bases. Thailand, which has positioned itself as neutral in these conflicts, is trying to attract multinational companies to set up production bases here, aiming to be part of the high-tech supply chain, such as in the semiconductor industry.\"\nThai products benefiting from geopolitical issues are mostly those that can replace products from conflicting countries, he said.\nFor example, Thailand exports rubber products and electrical appliances to the US as substitutes for Chinese goods.\nHowever, this substitution is limited, as the products the US imports from China are not the same as those Thailand exports.\nWith the Russia-Ukraine war, Thailand's palm oil exports have benefited from rising prices related to disruptions in sunflower oil supplies from Russia and Ukraine, leading to an increase in global vegetable oil prices.\nSome raw materials and intermediate goods that Thailand used to export to China are now being redirected to new production bases, such as Vietnam. These goods include electronic components, parts for electrical appliances, processed rubber, processed wood and chemicals.\nCAUTION ADVISED\nMr Benjarong said foreign investors are choosing Thailand partly because of its neutral stance in geopolitics, allowing it to benefit from trade and investment being diverted from conflicting countries.\nHowever, he advises caution, especially regarding products for which China has expanded investment in Thailand to use as a manufacturing base for exports to the US, in order to avoid a trade war.\nOne example is solar panels, as shipments from Thailand increased to the US recently. However, the US initiated an anti-dumping and countervailing duty investigation on solar panels from Thailand, and penalties could be applied to Thai exports, said Mr Benjarong.\nAnother impact from geopolitical tensions on Thai exports is rising shipping costs as conflicts continue in the Middle East between Israel and Hamas, Hezbollah in Lebanon and Houthi rebels in Yemen.\nThese conflicts have disrupted key shipping routes, such as the Bab-el-Mandeb Strait and the Suez Canal, which are crucial for transporting goods from Asia to Europe. As a result, some ships have opted to bypass these routes by sailing around Africa, increasing shipping costs.\nThe trade war between China and the US and EU has prompted Beijing to find ways to offload its excess production capacity to other trading partners, including Thailand.\nThis shift had a negative impact on Thai industries, including the automotive and auto parts sectors, as Thailand's internal combustion engine vehicle segment was disrupted by an influx of Chinese electric vehicles.\nSimilarly, Thailand's steel industry continues to be affected by Chinese dumping, he said.\nMr Benjarong said since the onset of the trade war, exports to the US have grown at double-digit rates, making the US Thailand's top export market, surpassing China since 2019.\nThailand is also diversifying its exports to markets with good growth prospects, while benefiting from the relocation of production bases out of China to other countries, such as India, Saudi Arabia and South Africa.\nSLOW TO ACT\nSomjai Phagaphasvivat, an independent political and economic analyst, said Thailand has been slow to respond in the geopolitical game.\nIn certain instances, policy shifts may have caused misunderstandings with some major powers, he said.\nAn example of Thailand's hesitancy is the country has yet to sign a free trade agreement (FTA) with developed markets such as the EU, while Vietnam already finalised a pact with the bloc.\nFTA negotiations with the EU have been stalled since the 2014 coup. Thailand has a Partnership and Cooperation Agreement with the EU, signed two years ago.\nFinalising the details on an FTA between Thailand and the EU is expected to take a considerable amount of time, said Mr Somjai.\nNegotiations for the Thai-EU FTA are expected to begin next month. Vietnam signed its FTA with the EU many years ago, he said.\nThe Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) includes 11 countries and four Asean nations -- Vietnam, Brunei, Singapore and Malaysia -- but not Thailand.\nThis puts Thailand at a disadvantage to its competitors when exporting goods to Canada, Mexico, Chile and Peru, as CPTPP members enjoy zero tariffs when exporting to fellow members.\nAlthough Thailand has bilateral FTAs with Peru and Chile, it lacks such agreements with Mexico and Canada.\nCPTPP is a trade agreement between Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore and Vietnam. It evolved from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which faded after the US withdrew.\nThe combined economies of these 11 countries account for 13.4% of global GDP (around US$13.5 trillion), making the CPTPP the third-largest free trade zone in the world by GDP, after the North American Free Trade Agreement and the EU.\nWhile Thailand is a member of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), which includes economies representing 30% of global GDP, the standards set by RCEP are lower than those of the CPTPP.\nAs a result, if Thailand exports goods to Australia, New Zealand and Japan, which are CPTPP members, it may face trade barriers because of the CPTPP's higher product standards, said Mr Somjai.\nRCEP is Thailand's 14th trade pact, initiated by Asean to promote trade among member states and with their FTA partners.\nAsean member nations comprise Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam, while the five trading partners are Australia, China, Japan, New Zealand and South Korea.\nRCEP aims to eliminate trade barriers and promote investment, helping emerging economies catch up globally.\nRCEP developed from the Asean+3 and Asean+6 frameworks, part of a strategy under the AEC Blueprint to maintain centrality in driving larger economic integration in the region.\nOn Nov 15, 2020, RCEP ministers from 15 countries signed the RCEP Agreement during the 4th RCEP Summit via teleconference.\nWALKING A TIGHTROPE\nHe said Thailand's memberships may raise questions about its alignment and whether it leans towards one bloc or another.\nThailand is a member of the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity, a 14-nation group led by the US, but it is also attempting to join BRICS, a group led by Russia and China that opposes the US.\nThis duality has led to a perception that Thailand may not be aligned with the US, said Mr Somjai.\nFor instance, Saudi Arabia wanted to join BRICS but hesitated, not wanting to be misunderstood by the US, he said.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWould you consider buying a house in a gated community or as a standalone property?\nGated community\nStandalone house\nEither, depending on location and price\nNo preference\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nThailand\nBusiness\nGeopolitics\nTrade\n\u0e18\u0e38\u0e23\u0e01\u0e34\u0e08\n\u0e20\u0e39\u0e21\u0e34\u0e23\u0e31\u0e10\u0e28\u0e32\u0e2a\u0e15\u0e23\u0e4c\n\u0e01\u0e32\u0e23\u0e04\u0e49\u0e32\nBalance\nNations\nGlobal\nTension\nDo you like the content of this article?\n17\n12\nCOMMENT\n(3)",

The excess water, along with mud, flowed into the Mae Sai River, suggesting there was a change in land use in headwater areas.\nMr Thanapon said the mud had two sources: natural landslides and agriculture or mining in forest areas. Meanwhile, exposed topsoil became mud in the river.\n\"However, while there are no statistics on this, my assumption is the large amount of mud didn't come solely from nearby areas,\" he said. \"Over 80% of it likely originates from the Mae Sai River watershed.\"\nThe flood was not caused by the release of excess water from upstream dams in Laos and China as some thought, he said. Coping with future flood risks is a huge challenge, especially when the Thai side is located downstream.\nIn the short term, apart from rehabilitating flood-ravaged communities, opening water-level monitoring stations in the headwaters of the Mae Sai River is a must-do to serve as an early warning system, he said.\nNext is developing a more efficient disaster response plan or improving city planning, Mr Thanapon said.\nHowever, that would be an uphill task because the area is a special economic zone and people are unlikely to relocate. An evacuation plan should be in place to ensure those in risk-prone areas are safely evacuated during a flood.\nIn the long term, the central government must step in because local authorities do not have adequate resources to manage the situation -- whether to restore flood protection barriers or improve water drainage capacity through the irrigation system.\nMr Thanapon stressed the need to foster collaboration with Myanmar, saying cooperation must be multi-dimensional, engaging communities, businesses and academic input.\nThis is a cross-border issue that affects both countries, and the area is not only under the control of the Myanmar government but also under the control of ethnic minorities and armed groups, he added.\n\"Managing water is easier than tackling the issue of mud, as the latter involves land use and requires much more time,\" he said. \"We need to persuade our neighbour to be aware of the soil erosion problem.\n\"Both sides also have a lot of work to do because there is no data on the amount of mud, which is essential for planning and decision-making,\" he said.\nFlood mitigation needed\nSuchatvee: Incentivise relocation to safe areas\nSuchatvee Suwansawat, a former president of the Engineering Institute of Thailand, said the flooding was caused by global warming and human activities, such as deforestation and encroachment on riverbanks.\nThe issue requires a strong will from the government, particularly Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra, who must bring together state agencies to develop an urban plan and ensure it is strictly enforced to ensure sustainability, he said.\nMr Suchatvee said communities in water retention areas should be made aware of the situation and offered incentives to relocate.\n\"It happens every year, and how bad depends on the amount of water. If the government and the public do not cooperate, it will get worse each year,\" he said.\nMr Thanapon said several buildings on the Thai side near the First Friendship Bridge obstruct the water flow and dismantling them could enable faster drainage and allow for the construction of flood barriers.\nRegarding Mae Sai's Sailom Joy Market, a border market severely hit by floods, he said if businesses are to remain in their current locations, the buildings must be at least two storeys high to allow occupants to move to the upper floors during a flood.\nHe admitted residents may struggle to finance renovations and the proposal may require the collaboration of multiple sectors. He noted that businesses may need to relocate if the situation is critical.\nAs for flooding in the city of Chiang Mai, Mr Thanapon said urban communities have limited knowledge about how to cope because they do not face the problem regularly.\nHe said the \"Chiang Mai model\" is not enough to deal with extremely high levels of floodwater.\nThat would require a multi-million-baht project, such as a large drainage tunnel beneath the city, to cope with flooding. However, stakeholders will have to determine whether such an investment is worth it.\nOn revising the city plan, he said its success relies on the cooperation of the public and those responsible for enforcing city planning laws.\nHe said people in Chiang Mai should realise that flooding can occur at any time, and given the amount of water, flooding is inevitable because there is no way to divert it elsewhere.\nKey venues, such as hospitals, should explore methods to mitigate damage from flooding and consider the measures taken by the Shangri-La Hotel, which used a flood barrier to protect the premises.\n\"The public must understand that flooding is unavoidable, but its impact can be mitigated for key locations. Fortunately, this time the Bhumibol dam could still take water, which helped with drainage,\" he said.\nReclaiming flood plains\nPianporn: Solutions must be 'nature-based'\nPianporn Deetes, campaign director for the Southeast Asia Programme at the International Rivers Network, said the flooding in Chiang Rai and Chiang Mai indicates water retention areas have been occupied by people amid uncontrolled expansion of cities.\nAerial photographs showed the rivers overflowed into the same areas that had flooded in the past, as if the rivers were reclaiming their former territory.\nIn the case of the Mae Sai River, she said the section near the 1st Friendship Bridge used to be much wider but structures on both the Thai and Myanmar sides have encroached on the riverbanks.\nUpstream there are areas of exposed soil as the result of mining activities which may also contribute to the mudslides, she said.\n\"To reduce the severity of future flooding, it's time we have a good understanding of extreme changes in climate. The earth is 'boiling' and we need nature-based solutions like preserving wetlands, rather than trying to control the river,\" she said.\nShe agreed that international cooperation is needed to deal with transboundary flooding but said addressing the issue is a challenge for the government because the border areas involve several ethnic groups and participation from all sides is necessary.\nMs Pianporn also criticised authorities for their lack of preparedness in terms of warnings and responses.\nShe said those who suffer the most are the poor and the marginalised, and the government must find ways to help people rebuild their lives and livelihoods.\n\"I visited the Nam Kok community in Chiang Rai and saw the debris from small food shops. An electrician lost both his home and his tools while a community that grew vegetables was completely wiped out,\" she said.\nVideo: Flooding, smog and climate change: the land use connection\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat is your preferred house size (in terms of number of bedrooms)?\n1 bedroom\n2\u20133 bedrooms\n4+ bedrooms\nNo preference\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nThailand\nChiang Rai\nChiang Mai\nFlood\n\u0e40\u0e0a\u0e35\u0e22\u0e07\u0e23\u0e32\u0e22\n\u0e40\u0e0a\u0e35\u0e22\u0e07\u0e43\u0e2b\u0e21\u0e48\n\u0e2d\u0e38\u0e17\u0e01\u0e20\u0e31\u0e22\nPrevention\nMud\nDo you like the content of this article?\n34\n47\nCOMMENT\n(14)",

The upcoming Asean-related summits in Vientiane this week are no different. After the pandemic, Asean has become more prominent, though sometimes passive, in the region. By not fully taking sides in the East-West divide, Asean keeps its influence and room to handle the complex global security issues.\nDr Surin Pitsuwan, the late Asean secretary-general, told US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in 2009 that a strong and successful Asean meant one less problem for the US. This remains true today. Asean has never been a challenge or enemy to the US. Maintaining good relations has been the focus despite sometimes being overlooked. US policymakers often criticise Asean for not having a unified voice on matters important to the US. US participation in the Asean-US summit and East Asia Summit is difficult for the rotating Asean chairs to secure every year.\nAt the Vientiane summits, Secretary of State Antony Blinken will represent President Joe Biden. The Lao chair hosting the meetings understands the pressures in the US as the country heads into a presidential election. It is impractical for Mr Biden or Vice President Kamala Harris to attend in person. Mr Biden is focused on his legacy in his last months in office, while Ms Harris is busy with her presidential election campaign. Even so, Mr Blinken's attendance shows that the US still values its relationship with Asean. Mr Blinken attended the Asean summit once in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, in 2022, and in May, he held a special summit with Asean leaders in Washington, DC. Given his busy schedule, Mr Biden could have sent a lower-level official like National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, as former President Donald Trump did in 2019 when he sent Robert O'Brien, his national security adviser, to the Asean-related summits in Thailand. Sending Mr Blinken shows the Biden administration's continuity and commitment to its Asean policy.\nADVERTISEMENT\nOut of many reasons Asean remains important to the US, two stand out -- the bloc's strategic position and its key role in global value chains. Under Mr Biden, Asean and its members have become important in his efforts to unite allies and partners to face challenges like China's rise and other geopolitical changes, including global economic and political shifts.\nRELATED\nthailand\nBare-knuckle politics\nopinion\nChoking democracy\nWashington has been selective in treating certain Asean members and dialogue partners favourably when they align with its strategic goals. While this can sometimes influence Asean's decisions, it has not changed the bloc's overall stance much. This helps explain why Asean continues to host such high-level summits. Their meetings ensure that Asean stays a neutral and safe space for major powers to engage without bias.\nUS-Asean relations are still growing despite further work being needed. US investment in Asean is persistent. Last year, the US was Asean's biggest investor, with foreign direct investment (FDI) totalling $74.4 billion (2.5 trillion baht), making up 32.4% of the bloc's total FDI. Two-way trade between the US and Asean reached $395.9 billion, making the US Asean's second-largest trading partner.\nIt's impossible to talk about US-Asean ties without comparing them to Asean's relationship with China, especially in economic matters. Last year, China-Asean trade totalled $696.7 billion, far more than US-Asean trade. However, China's investment in Asean, at $17.3 billion, was much lower than that of the US. The US could increase trade with Asean by expanding market access and reducing protectionist policies, strengthening its economic presence in the region.\nThe US is currently working with partners in the Asia-Pacific to finalise the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF), which doesn't cover market access like traditional free trade agreements. However, Asean members are worried about future trade relations with the US if Mr Trump returns to the White House.\nBoth the US and China see Asean as a key region for engagement and investment, leading to competition for stronger ties. Asean is now the world's second-largest FDI recipient, just behind the US. Last year, Asean attracted $229.8 billion in FDI, compared to $310.9 billion received by the US. No major power wants to weaken Asean, as doing so could hurt their own interests. China's FDI in the region has grown recently, especially in electric vehicles.\nRegardless of who wins the US presidency in November, Asean will continue to be a bridge between the two superpowers. More importantly, the bloc aims to attract investment from both the world's No.1 and No.2 economies. Asean is improving its investment systems, including updating trade agreements to include digital trade, decarbonisation, and the circular economy under the Asean Community Vision 2045, aiming to make the region an investment hub. Asean's economy is expected to grow and could become the world's fourth-largest in six years. US-Asean relations will increasingly focus on trade and investment, but Asean also wants deeper US cooperation in areas like artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, and the digital economy.\nAt a recent meeting in Vientiane between Asean economic ministers and US Trade Representative Sarah Ellerman, they discussed changes in Asean's exports to the US. In the first quarter of this year, Asean exports to the US amounted to $68.7 billion -- more than exports to China, which were $65.3 billion. This reflects the US buying more semiconductors and electrical components from Asean, which is vital to regional supply chains. These trends have long-term strategic implications for both regions' ties with China.\nAsean hopes the US will keep supporting its existing supply chains to ensure stability amid global disruptions. The region's connectivity has stayed strong despite the Covid-19 pandemic, which has helped regional economies grow. The US now has the chance to tap into Asean's potential, helping sustain supply chains.\nAs Mr Blinken attends the 12th Asean-US Summit and the 19th East Asia Summit on Friday, he must reaffirm the US commitment to engaging with Asean. However, there are worries that US domestic politics and conflicts in Europe and the Middle East might further distract Washington from Southeast Asia. The challenge for the US is to balance its global priorities while keeping its strategic partnership with Asean strong and beneficial for both sides.\nKavi Chongkittavorn\nA veteran journalist on regional affairs\nKavi Chongkittavorn is a veteran journalist on regional affairs\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat is your budget range for purchasing a house in Thailand?\nUnder 3 million THB\n3 million - 5 million THB\n5 million - 8 million THB\n8 million - 12 million THB\nOver 12 million THB\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nOpinion\nMeeting\nAsean\nVientiane\n\u0e1b\u0e23\u0e30\u0e0a\u0e38\u0e21\n\u0e2d\u0e32\u0e40\u0e0b\u0e35\u0e22\u0e19\n\u0e40\u0e27\u0e35\u0e22\u0e07\u0e08\u0e31\u0e19\u0e17\u0e19\u0e4c\nDo you like the content of this article?\n4\n21\nCOMMENT\n(4)",

Now, as the year enters its final quarter, it is becoming increasingly apparent that 2025 will be an equally transformative \"year of governance\".\nThe 2024 election cycle has already led to significant political shifts. In Poland, record turnout among women and young voters in last year's general election handed a victory to a united coalition of pro-democracy parties, which also won the European elections in June. The same month, India's general election resulted in another win for Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), but the BJP lost its parliamentary majority, owing to regional movements and social-justice campaigns that enabled opposition parties to make significant gains. And in Senegal, mass protests forced former president Macky Sall to abandon his efforts to extend his term by postponing the election. Just weeks later, Bassirou Diomaye Faye, a former tax inspector running on an anti-corruption platform, won decisively.\nWhile the challenges ahead may seem daunting, these victories offer glimmers of hope, underscoring the resilience of democratic systems. But as the world shifts from the electoral frenzy of 2024 to the practical realities of governing, newly elected reformist leaders will face the difficult task of making good on their campaign promises.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThis is no easy feat, even in well-established democracies. Countries emerging from autocratic rule face even greater challenges, as new governments must dismantle entrenched networks of former regime loyalists who may act as spoilers and try to block any reform that threatens their interests.\nRELATED\nbusiness\nIEAT eager to unveil Smart Park estate\nbusiness\nUnwinding the Dr Boon scandal\nRecent political transitions offer important lessons for newly elected reformist leaders as they confront what we call the \"five Ds\": democratic (re)construction, debunking propaganda, discord, debt, and disasters.\nFirst, to prevent democratic backsliding, newly elected reformers must strengthen core democratic institutions like the legislature, the judiciary, and independent government agencies. Above all, they need to protect these bodies from the influence of illiberal forces, both foreign and domestic.\nIn extreme cases, sweeping reforms are necessary to root out entrenched corruption and restore integrity to public administration. Ukraine's 2014 Revolution of Dignity is a prime example. After ousting Viktor Yanukovych's kleptocratic regime, the new government -- in cooperation with civil-society groups -- initiated a series of anti-corruption measures. These included vetting the judiciary, strengthening accountability mechanisms, and introducing transparency tools like open-access databases to enable ordinary citizens to track corporate ownership structures and the allocation of state resources.\nSecond, reformist leaders must confront sophisticated information operations aimed at undermining their legitimacy. Taiwan, for example, has faced relentless efforts by China to destabilise its democratic process through false narratives. In Moldova, President Maia Sandu has had to fend off a barrage of pro-Russian propaganda and cyberattacks from the Kremlin and domestic pro-Russian factions.\nThird, reformist governments often inherit countries plagued by deep social and political divisions. Addressing these lingering conflicts is critical for new leaders. In Guatemala, for example, President Bernardo Ar\u00e9valo has engaged in dialogue with indigenous communities, acknowledging the centuries of violence and exclusion they have endured while making a genuine effort to respond to their needs.\nFourth, debt distress can severely impede a new government's ability to implement essential economic and social programmes. When Zambian President Hakainde Hichilema took office in 2021, he discovered that his predecessors had taken on enormous, undisclosed loans, especially from China. Zambia's crushing debt burden has forced the government to spend more on servicing loans than it does on health, education, and sanitation combined. Meanwhile, the process of restructuring these debts has dragged on for more than three years.\nKenya offers another stark example of the powerful destabilising role debt can play. Earlier this year, President William Ruto was forced to withdraw a controversial finance bill aimed at reducing the country's US$80 billion (2.5 trillion baht) debt after a wave of protests against its austerity provisions left dozens dead.\nLastly, with global temperatures rising at an alarming rate, climate-related disasters are becoming increasingly frequent. Experts warn that children born today will experience a sevenfold increase in extreme-weather events compared to their grandparents. Incoming leaders must establish robust systems that enable quick and effective responses to crises while upholding democratic principles such as transparency, accountability, and inclusion. This is particularly urgent in climate-vulnerable countries like Malawi, where devastating floods and droughts have led to crop failures and acute levels of food insecurity.\nAmid economic and geopolitical turmoil, the stakes could not be higher. Newly elected reformist leaders must deliver on their promises to improve living standards while protecting democracy. Failure risks pushing voters toward populist leaders and exposing their countries to domestic or foreign manipulation. But if they succeed, the coming \"year of governance\" could be a turning point, ushering in an era of democratic renewal.\n\u00a92024 Project Syndicate\nAdam Nelson is Senior Program Director for the Asia-Pacific at the National Democratic Institute.

To be sure, neither seems to want open conflict between the two powers, which could precipitate a nightmarish descent into global chaos. But Chinese decision-makers expect bitter disputes over trade, technology, and Taiwan regardless of who wins.\nChina is preparing for more turbulence by taking a whole-country approach to its relations with the US. That means moving beyond the realm of foreign affairs and coordinating with economic policymakers, military personnel, and technology leaders, as well as mobilising resources across the country. Such an approach is informed by the US strategy of containment, which in recent years has included relentless efforts to maintain America's technological supremacy, curb China's access to the global market, and build a coalition of allies, both in Asia and elsewhere, to tackle the \"China challenge\". Feeling under siege, China is girding itself for long-term enmity with the world's largest economy.\nAs part of this process, China has shifted its economic paradigm away from chasing growth at any cost to building a resilient economy that is driven by innovation and can cope with protracted geopolitical tensions. By accelerating domestic innovation, Chinese President Xi Jinping also aims to restructure the economy and help reduce its overreliance on the property sector. The recently concluded third plenum of the 20th Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee gave the final stamp of approval for this massive overhaul.\nADVERTISEMENT\nScientific advancement and technological prowess are another of Mr Xi's key strategic goals. China has attached great importance to developing its capacity for innovation and is determined to become a global champion in certain tech sectors. But targeted US sanctions against Chinese tech companies and individuals have thwarted these efforts -- and are thus working as intended.\nRELATED\nbusiness\nMalaysia economy sustains strong growth with investment surge\nlife\nBhutan making tourism easier to spur economy\nTrade and investment have traditionally been seen as stabilising forces in Sino-American relations. But Chinese leaders now place less emphasis on them because their tangible benefits to bilateral ties have been significantly reduced, owing to increased commercial competitiveness and the country's transition from a low-end, export-led growth model to a high-end, technology-driven economy. China's rapid progress in manufacturing electric vehicles and semiconductors has instead stoked trade tensions with the US.\nBut Taiwan is still by far the most sensitive issue in US-China relations. Despite no formal changes to the wording of China's policy, Chinese strategists largely consider the current situation to be precarious, given Taiwan's new pro-independence government. This will likely result in China shifting to more active deterrence against Taiwan's leadership and, by extension, the US. With America similarly strengthening deterrent measures against China, the ingredients for a confrontation in the Taiwan Strait are in place. To prevent the worst-case scenario, Mr Xi should conduct regular face-to-face conversations with whomever US voters elect in November.\nChina's main goal is to ensure that any further erosion of Sino-American relations does not hinder economic growth, which underpins the regime's legitimacy. Chinese policymakers have thus tried to minimise damage from the country's fallout with the US by expanding its economic and political influence in the rest of the world, most notably in the Global South. This could buy time for China to build economic resilience and accelerate the pace of technological development.\nWith Mr Trump and Ms Harris vying to sound the toughest on China in the run-up to the election, Chinese decision-makers harbour no illusions that rocky relations with the US will magically improve in the near future. But the Sino-American relationship should not be viewed with excessive pessimism. China's policy toward the US has always been and will continue to be a product of balanced deliberation that accounts for the state of international affairs and weighs the country's own needs. That has not changed, despite major shifts in the political landscape under Mr Xi.\nIt is promising that both sides have recently shown more interest in responsibly managing ties. While the Sino-American rivalry will not disappear overnight, the world's two largest economies could still avoid conflict -- and the catastrophic consequences that would likely follow -- no matter who enters the White House next year.\n\u00a92024 Project Syndicate\nYu Jie is a senior research fellow on China in the Asia-Pacific Programme at Chatham House.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat is your preferred house size (in terms of number of bedrooms)?\n1 bedroom\n2\u20133 bedrooms\n4+ bedrooms\nNo preference\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nUs election\nChina\nDo you like the content of this article?\n11\n8\nCOMMENT\n(1)",

While Asian markets, especially the Nikkei, experienced sharp losses in recent weeks, a positive tipping point has been reached as well: for the first time ever, over half of Asia's 4.8 billion people are part of the global consumer class, defined by the World Data Lab as those spending more than US$12 (400 baht) per day in purchasing power parity prices.\nThe importance of this milestone can hardly be overstated. It marks the transition from poverty to a more typical middle-class lifestyle, where individuals start engaging in discretionary spending on items like motorcycles, gas stoves and beauty products.\nThe dominance of Asians in the global consumer class is a relatively recent development. Until 2000, the global consumer class was predominantly Western, totalling 1.7 billion people. In 1980, over 70% of the consumer class was in wealthy OECD countries. World Data Lab estimates that today, almost 60% of the global consumer class is Asian. Asia currently has 2.4 billion consumers and will add one billion more in the next decade, implying that it will account for 65% of the global consumer class. But the Asian consumer is mostly an entry-level consumer, spending on average $20 per day. This means that Asia's total spending power is currently $19 trillion, roughly 30% of global consumer spending.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe dichotomy of rapid growth in Asia's consumer class and only moderately strong growth in consumer spending will continue. In our latest World Consumer Outlook, we project that Asia will continue to lead global consumer class growth, contributing 110 million of the 134 million new consumers expected next year. Additionally, one-third of every additional dollar spent globally will come from Asia.\nRELATED\nopinion\nNo more bailouts\nbusiness\nMinor seeks to double hotel portfolio\nWorld Data Lab projects that India will surpass China in adding people to the consumer class next year, with India contributing 47 million new consumers compared to China's 33 million. Following them are five often overlooked Asian economies: Indonesia (+6 million), Bangladesh (+4 million), Vietnam (+4 million), the Philippines (+3 million) and Pakistan (+2.5 million). In Olympic terms, Asia will dominate the top seven positions among the global consumer class leaders for 2024, followed by the US, Brazil and Egypt, respectively.\nThere are still 2.4 billion people in Asia who have yet to enter the consumer class, along with an additional 330 million newborns by 2034. This represents more than half of the world's future consumers. World Data Lab projects that Asia will add 1 billion new consumers and $15 trillion in additional consumer spending by 2034. Most countries in emerging Asia, however, have yet to reach the tipping point. China and Vietnam did in the last decade, and World Data Lab projects that India, Indonesia and the Philippines will soon (in 2027, 2028 and 2029, respectively). Bangladesh, Pakistan and Nepal will become majority consumer markets only in the 2030s.\nWhile the growth momentum of Asia's consumer class is strong, the current economic environment is volatile. Recent market turbulence in Asia has raised concerns about investor confidence and the stability of financial markets in the region. But these risks are likely only to delay, rather than derail, the expansion of Asia's consumer base. Like the Covid-19 pandemic, which similarly interrupted the growth of Asia's consumer class, these challenges will not stop Asia's long-term rise in consumer power. The underlying factors driving this growth -- longer life expectancy, better education, urbanisation -- have been put in place over the last decades, and these long-term shifts will influence Asia's trajectory more than any short-term shock could undo.\nTrendlines will prevail over headlines. It is safe to say that China will remain the world's largest consumer market for seniors, currently at 122 million and growing to 178 million by 2030. By contrast, India will be the largest market for young Gen Z consumers, growing from 150 million today, about as large as in China, to 215 million in 2030. Global consumer goods companies should bet on Asia. If you bet against demographics, you typically lose.\n\u00a92024 Project Syndicate\nJuan Caballero is a senior data scientist at World Data Lab, where he leads the Insights and Analytics team.

It has leveraged thousands of accounts across more than 50 websites, forums and social media platforms.\nADVERTISEMENT\nAds powered by\n\"The key takeaway from this report,\" said Jack Stubbs, who manages Graphika's research team, is that Spamouflage has \"become more aggressive in its efforts to infiltrate and sway US political conversations.\"\nRELATED\nbusiness\nAsian equities retreat as China disappoints\nworld\nChina says&nbsp;Philippines&nbsp;has 'provoked trouble' in S.China Sea with US backing\n\"This matters because it shows Chinese influence operations targeting the US are evolving, engaging in more advanced deceptive behaviours, and directly targeting these organic but hyper-sensitive rifts in society,\" Stubbs added.\nIn one example highlighted by Graphika, the Chinese operation impersonated American anti-war activists. Using multiple accounts on X, the operatives created memes that labelled Trump a \"fraud\", showing him in an orange prison uniform, and called Biden a \"coward\".\nIn halting English, a different account asked: \"the present American still our America?\"\nLiu Pengyu, a spokesperson for China's embassy in Washington, said, \"China has no intention and will not interfere in the US election, and we hope that the US side will not make an issue of China in the election.\"\nFacebook previously attributed the campaign to Chinese law enforcement, calling it \"the largest known cross-platform covert influence operation in the world.\"\nSpamouflage's messaging does not appear to favour one side of the political spectrum \u2013 either Democrats or Republicans \u2013 but rather aims to amplify existing criticisms toward American society and government.\nHistorically, the group had limited success engaging with actual Americans, but that began to change in mid-2023 when the operatives increasingly targeted genuine supporters of former President Donald Trump, according to the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, which has done its own research into Spamouflage.\nTracking influence operations\nGraphika identified 15 Spamouflage accounts on social media platform X and one account on TikTok, all claiming to be US citizens or media outlets. It also highlighted other profiles associated with those accounts on YouTube and Instagram that were suspended by the time it finished its report.\nX did not respond to a request for comment.\nA YouTube spokesperson said, \u201cThe channel flagged by Graphika was previously identified and terminated as part of our investigations into coordinated influence operations, and had a very small number of views at the time it was removed.\u201d\nThe Tiktok account, named Harlan Report, was among the group's most successful assets. It posted a single video in July which garnered 1.5 million views.\nThat video, which was removed from TikTok last week, mocked a Biden press conference at NATO's 75th anniversary summit where he stumbled over a speech. Like similar social media posts shared widely at the time, it transcribed Biden's words erroneously to suggest that he had made a sexual reference, according to a Reuters Fact check\nFact check\nA Reuters review of the Harlan Report account on TikTok showed that it posted its first video in May. Other recent videos posted by the account racked up hundreds of thousands of views, including one shared last week showing CNN panellists discussing the network's interview with Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris.\nA TikTok spokesperson said the company permanently banned the Harlan Report account for violating its community guidelines.\nMeta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, confirmed that it had removed Spamouflage activity from its platforms in two places as part of its ongoing enforcement against the operation. Neither was able to gain much traction with authentic audiences, a Meta spokesperson said.\nThe US government is investigating foreign efforts to interfere in the election.\nIn July, the US Office of the Director of National Intelligence, released a report on election interference, noting that China was \"approaching this US presidential election more cautiously ... and probably does not plan to influence the outcome.\" However, \"we are tracking efforts to influence the US public more broadly.\"\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat type of building do you prefer for a condominium?\nHigh-rise (more than 10 floors)\nMid-rise (5-10 floors)\nLow-rise (less than 5 floors)\nNo preference\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nChina\nUs\nElection\nInfluence\nCovert\nFacebook\nTiktok\nDo you like the content of this article?\n4\n6\nCOMMENT\n(23)",

(Photo: Bloomberg)\nRIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 X, formerly known as Twitter, began to go dark across Brazil on Saturday after the South American nation's Supreme Court blocked the social network because its owner, Elon Musk, refused to comply with court orders to suspend certain accounts.\nThe moment posed one of the biggest tests yet of the billionaire's efforts to transform the site into a digital town square where just about anything goes.\nAlexandre de Moraes, a Brazilian Supreme Court justice, ordered the country's telecom agency to block access to X across the nation of 200 million because the company lacked a physical presence in Brazil.\nADVERTISEMENT\nMusk closed X's office in Brazil last week after de Moraes threatened arrests for ignoring his orders to remove X accounts that he said broke Brazilian laws.\nRELATED\nthailand\nAutopsy finds blood infection, swollen spine in singer's death\nbusiness\nThai businesses call for huge stimulus\nX said that it viewed de Moraes' sealed orders as illegal and that it planned to publish them. \"Free speech is the bedrock of democracy and an unelected pseudo-judge in Brazil is destroying it for political purposes,\" Musk said Friday.\nIn a highly unusual move, de Moraes also said that any person in Brazil who tried to still use X via common privacy software called a virtual private network, or VPN, could be fined nearly US$9,000 a day.\nAlso, De Moraes froze the finances of a second Musk business in Brazil, SpaceX's Starlink satellite-internet service, to try to collect $3 million in fines he has levied against X. Starlink \u2014 which has recently exploded in popularity in Brazil, with more than 250,000 customers \u2014 said it planned to fight the order and would make its service free in Brazil if necessary.\nBrazil's Supreme Court Judge Alexandre de Moraes attends an event where he received a tribute by the Public Ministry of Sao Paulo, after the Brazilian Supreme Court ordered an immediate suspension of social media platform X in the country, in Sao Paulo, Brazil, on Saturday. (Photo: Reuters)\nMusk and de Moraes have been sparring for months. Musk says de Moraes is illegally censoring conservative voices. De Moraes says Musk is illegally obstructing his work to clean up the Brazilian internet.\nIn his order, de Moraes said Musk was an \"outlaw\" who intended to \"allow the massive spread of disinformation, hate speech and attacks on the democratic rule of law, violating the free choice of the electorate, by keeping voters away from real and accurate information.\"\nThe fight is now at the centre of Musk's bid to turn X into a safe haven for people to say nearly anything they want, even if it hurts the business in the process.\nIn dozens of posts since April, Musk has built up de Moraes as one of the world's biggest enemies of free speech, and it appears Musk is now betting the judge will cave to the public backlash he believes the block will cause.\n\"He might be losing money in the short term, but he's gaining enormous political capital,\" said Luca Belli, a professor at FGV Law School in Rio de Janeiro, who has tracked Musk's strategy with X.\nBut the longer the blackout on X lasts, the more it will test Musk's commitment to his ideology at the expense of revenue, market share and influence.\nSince 2022, Brazil has ranked fourth globally with more than 25 million downloads of the X application, according to Appfigures, an app data firm. X\u2019s international business has become more important under Musk, as American advertisers have fled the site because of an increase in hate speech and misinformation since Musk bought it.\nElon Musk, who leads Tesla, SpaceX, and the social media company X, during the NYT DealBook Summit in New York, on Nov 29, 2023. (Photo: New York Times)\nMusk has overhauled the social network since buying it for $44 billion in 2022, when it was called Twitter. In addition to renaming the service, he jettisoned many of its rules about what users could say. (Although he introduced a new rule against using a term he deems overly liberal: \u201ccisgender.\u201d) He also reinstated suspended accounts, including that of former President Donald Trump.\nYet, Musk said X would still follow the law where it operates. Under his leadership, X has complied with demands from the Indian government to withhold accounts and removed links to a\nBBC\ndocumentary that painted a critical portrait of Narendra Modi, India\u2019s prime minister.\nAt other times, Musk has battled orders to remove content, such as in Australia, where he fought an order to remove videos depicting a violent attack against a local bishop.\nBut he has met a formidable challenge in de Moraes.\nFew people have had a larger singular impact on what is said online in recent years than the Brazilian judge. He has emerged as one of Brazil\u2019s most powerful \u2014 and polarising \u2014 figures after the country\u2019s Supreme Court enshrined him with expansive powers to crack down on threats to democracy online, amid fears about a far-right movement led by Jair Bolsonaro, Brazil\u2019s former president.\nBefore Brazil's 2022 election, the court empowered de Moraes to unilaterally order the takedown of accounts he deemed threats. He has since wielded that power liberally, often in sealed orders that do not disclose why a given account was suspended.\nHe has ordered X to remove at least 140 accounts, most of them right wing, including some of Brazil's most prominent conservative pundits and members of Congress. Some of those accounts questioned Bolsonaro's 2022 election loss and sympathised with the right-wing mob that stormed Brazil's Congress and Supreme Court.\nDe Moraes has also led multiple criminal investigations into Bolsonaro and voted to deem the former president ineligible to run in Brazil's next presidential election.\nThose efforts have made de Moraes a hero of Brazil's left \u2014 and the No. 1 enemy of Brazil's right.\nMusk suddenly entered the debate in April with a series of posts calling de Moraes a dictator, giving new life to Bolsonaro\u2019s right-wing movement. Bolsonaro and his supporters lauded Musk as a savior from a tyrannical judge.\nYet, when de Moraes included Musk in an investigation into disinformation and began threatening X with fines, the company sent a conciliatory letter that it would comply with the judge\u2019s orders.\nThen, in recent weeks, X stopped complying. After de Moraes threatened the company's legal representative in Brazil with arrest, Musk closed X's office.\n\"The people of Brazil have a choice to make \u2014 democracy, or Alexandre de Moraes,\" X wrote when announcing the move.\nMusk has used X as a political cudgel. To his nearly 200 million followers, he has repeatedly boosted Trump and other right-wing leaders, while mocking politicians he opposes, such as Vice President Kamala Harris and Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva.\nLula supported the block of X. \"Just because someone has money doesn\u2019t mean they can do whatever they want,\" he said Friday. \u201cThey must accept the country\u2019s rules.\"\nThe US Embassy in Brazil said it was monitoring the dispute. \u201cThe United States values freedom of speech as a cornerstone of a healthy democracy,\u201d the embassy said in a statement.\nSeveral authoritarian governments have banned X, including China, Russia, Iran and North Korea. Some other nations have temporarily blocked the site at times. In 2021, Nigeria suspended the service for about seven months after the company removed posts by the country\u2019s then president threatening secessionist groups.\nOn Friday, de Moraes ordered Brazil's telecom agency to \"adopt all necessary measures\" within 24 hours to block people in Brazil from using X.\nHe also said that people who use VPNs to circumvent the block and access X could face fines of nearly $9,000 a day. VPNs, which can make internet traffic appear as if it was coming from a different country, are commonly used software for privacy and cybersecurity.\nDe Moraes issued multiple orders Friday. In the first, he also ordered Apple and Google to prevent downloads of X as well as popular VPN apps.\nPeople across Brazil quickly criticised the move against VPN apps, and about three hours later, de Moraes issued an amendment to the order, this time leaving out the directives to Apple and Google.\nEven with that amendment, Carlos Affonso Souza, a Brazilian internet-law professor, called the order \"the most extreme judicial decision out of a Brazilian court in 30 years of internet law in Brazil.\"\nIt is not the first time Brazilian authorities have blocked an online service for ignoring court orders. Yet, such blocks have usually lasted just days before a company has reversed course and complied. That was the case in 2022, when de Moraes blocked the messaging app Telegram for a weekend.\nBelli, the law professor, said he expected the same with Musk and X. \"My bet is that he might be blocked for a couple of days, and then will comply and portray himself as a victim,\" Belli said. \"So, he\u2019s still winning.\"\nPeople holding mobile phones are silhouetted against a backdrop projected with the Twitter logo.

It's a worrying trend. Power is at risk of being concentrated in the hands of an exclusive club of entrenched clans. That will disproportionately disadvantage the region's dynamic youth who are getting more frustrated with nepotism.\nWhile Southeast Asia is not an isolated case -- political dynasties are prevalent in the West (think Bushes and Trudeaus, among others) -- the difference is just how many of the familiar names are making a comeback, since unrest and financial crisis in recent decades upended the Old Order in many places.\nTake the Philippines, where clans have controlled money and wielded influence dating back to colonial times. Their privilege allowed them to buy land in the post-independence era, after Manila broke free of US colonial rule in 1946. This enriched and propelled them further up the economic ladder. Wealth proved useful in their attempts to succeed in politics.\nADVERTISEMENT\nSix of the country's last nine presidents have belonged to the Macapagal, Marcos and Aquino families. The current president, Ferdinand \"Bongbong\" Marcos Jr, is the son of the former autocrat Ferdinand Marcos. During a reporting trip to Manila for the 2022 election, I was struck by the number of ordinary Filipinos who had conveniently forgotten the corruption and avarice of his regime, toppled amid street protests in 1986 after two decades in power. Instead, they chose to believe in a social media narrative that the younger Mr Marcos would bring back a perceived golden era of prosperity and stability.\nRELATED\nopinion\nUS looks to deepen Asean partnership\nopinion\nThai politics has turned upside down\nTapping into family lore helps with this generation's allure for voters. The child of a formidable political force has been elevated in Thailand, too. The former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra's 38-year-old daughter, Paetongtarn, was appointed earlier this month to his old job (which he lost in a coup in 2006). Her aunt and Thaksin's sister, Yingluck, previously served in the role before being removed by the Constitutional Court in 2014.\nPolitical dynasties aren't just confined to raucous democratic systems like the Philippines. In Cambodia, it has been a year since strongman Hun Sen handed over power to his son, Hun Manet, after almost four decades as leader. (For all intents and purposes, he is still running things behind the scenes as president of the ruling Cambodian People's Party and a lawmaker.)\nAnd then there's Indonesia, Southeast Asia's largest country and economy. Last week, widespread protests suspended parliamentary moves to potentially grant the outgoing president's son an easier path to political power. The sprawling archipelago had until recently been held up as a model for democracy in a region where corruption and nepotism -- which never really went away -- seem to be making an increasingly brazen comeback.\nWhen Joko Widodo was first elected in 2014, he was viewed as a breath of fresh air. With a humble demeanour and origins as a furniture maker from a provincial city, he came from outside the usual ranks of generals and elites that have run the country.\nBut Mr Widodo has used his second term to ensure that his legacy lasts beyond his departure from office in two months. \"Jokowi [as he is popularly known] has built a coalition with so many parties in parliament that he is getting to the point where he cannot be challenged, because of the power base he has created,\" Elisabeth Kramer, a senior lecturer in the School of Social Sciences at the University of New South Wales, told me. \"This allows him, and by extension his family, to protect their privilege and exclusivity, to ensure that only a certain club of people actually run for election and win.\"\nIndonesians are used to strong leaders with dynastic ambitions. The archetype was Suharto, whose 32-year dictatorship ended amid violent protests during the Asian Financial Crisis in 1998. Among grievances was how the former general turned a blind eye to the growing greed of his children, and how they used their position as his progeny to exploit the resource-rich nation's economy, at the expense of ordinary people struggling to make ends meet. Some Indonesians see parallels. A popular news magazine recreated a cover from the Suharto era, only this time with Mr Widodo's face on it -- calling him \"Raja Jawa\" -- the King of Java. The not-so-subtle insinuation is that Mr Widodo and his family are out of touch with everyday Indonesians, living a lavish lifestyle. This is a far cry from the man-of-the-people image he so carefully cultivated when he was first elected.\nFor now, at least, Indonesian protesters have managed to keep their democracy safe. The outgoing president and others in Southeast Asia with dynastic ambitions would be wise to look at Sheikh Hasina. The daughter of Bangladesh's founding father was forced to make a hasty and humiliating exit earlier this month, after 20 years of on-and-off rule that became increasingly autocratic, and dismissive of human rights. In the past, kings and queens would fight wars to ensure their children would inherit the throne. But they were not elected leaders, and their subjects had no choice but to put up with them. That is not the case in democracies today. Eventually, the people will make sure their voices are heard. Leaders would be wise to leave their families where they belong: At home.\u2009\u00a92024 Bloomberg\nKarishma Vaswani is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering Asia politics with a special focus on China.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat is your preferred house size (in terms of number of bedrooms)?\n1 bedroom\n2\u20133 bedrooms\n4+ bedrooms\nNo preference\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nDo you like the content of this article?\n32\n3\nCOMMENT\n(3)",

His leadership, emerging from a period of student-led protests and political upheaval, symbolises a triumph of democracy and justice in a region long plagued by strife. But as Bangladesh looks inward to heal and rebuild, there is an urgent call for its new leadership to turn its gaze toward a neighbour in dire need -- Myanmar.\nMyanmar, once a beacon of hope under the leadership of Nobel Laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, has spiralled into chaos since the military coup in 2021. The nation is now teetering on the brink of genocide, with tens of thousands imprisoned, tortured and executed by a ruthless military regime. Among the imprisoned is Ms Suu Kyi, the symbol of Myanmar's struggle for freedom, who languishes in solitary confinement, her fate unknown.\nThe Rohingya crisis has rightfully drawn global attention, exposing the brutal persecution of a marginalised group. Yet, this tragedy is but one chapter in a much larger story of systemic violence that has afflicted Myanmar for decades. The suffering extends far beyond the Rohingya, affecting various ethnic groups who have long endured the military's oppression.\nADVERTISEMENT\nMs Suu Kyi's efforts to address these issues were derailed in 2017 when the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army launched attacks that triggered a military crackdown. Her commitment to peace and justice was clear in her decision to commission a study by the late Kofi Annan, seeking solutions for the crisis in Rakhine State. However, the situation quickly escalated, leading to widespread suffering and displacement.\nProf Yunus, as Bangladesh's new leader, holds a unique position of influence. His country shares a border with Myanmar and has been directly affected by the influx of Rohingya refugees. Bangladesh's leadership can be a powerful force for good, not only within its own borders but also in advocating for the release of Myanmar's political prisoners and the restoration of democracy.\nRELATED\nthailand\nAuthorities uncover illegal  transmission cables in Tak\nsports\nONE Championship star Soe Lin Oo survives serious car crash, but is ruled out of Seksan fight\nIn a letter sent on Aug 16, United Nations Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres emphasised the urgent need for your government to ensure the protection of all citizens, especially minorities and to safeguard the well-being of the 1 million Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh. His words are timely, as the only hope for true reconciliation and the safe return of the Rohingya to Myanmar lies in the immediate release of Ms Suu Kyi and the entire democratically elected government. We believe you hold the key to achieving this historic and noble outcome.\nThere is a profound crisis of truth in our world today -- a crisis exacerbated by misinformation and the distortion of facts. Ms Suu Kyi has been vilified by many, her legacy marred by accusations of collusion with the military. Yet, evidence strongly refutes these claims. Her speeches and actions over the years, documented in a comprehensive four-volume series by myself and my colleague Fergus Harlow, reveal a leader steadfast in her commitment to justice and democracy.\nThe situation in Myanmar is escalating. Weapons supplied by global powers like Russia and China are fuelling the conflict, pushing the nation closer to the abyss. The world cannot afford to turn a blind eye. It is in this context that I appeal to Prof Yunus. His leadership in Bangladesh offers a rare opportunity to influence the course of history in Myanmar.\nWe propose the Ashoka Peace Accords -- a call for the immediate release of Myanmar's democratic leaders and an end to the violence that threatens to engulf the nation. The world is crying out for peace, dialogue and reconciliation -- not state-sanctioned murder. This initiative could mark the beginning of a second wave of independence in Myanmar, where truth, dignity and the power of conscience prevail over tyranny.\nThe assassination of Ko Ni, Ms Suu Kyi's lawyer, is a chilling reminder of the stakes involved. His murder, while holding his grandchild in broad daylight, was not just an attack on an individual; it was an attack on justice, freedom and the rule of law. This act of brutality underscores the urgent need for international intervention.\nProf Yunus has the power to be a catalyst for change in Myanmar. His voice, his influence, and his moral authority can shine a light on the injustices occurring in Myanmar, galvanising global action. The recent victory in Bangladesh can serve as an inspiration -- a demonstration of what is possible when courage and conscience come together.\nThe people of Myanmar, like those in Bangladesh, yearn for freedom, justice, and the restoration of democracy. The release of Ms Suu Kyi and the thousands of political prisoners rotting in Myanmar's prisons is not just a necessity for Myanmar's future -- it is a moral imperative for the world.\nAs Bangladesh navigates its own path forward, may it also lead the charge for justice and freedom in Myanmar. The world is watching, and the stakes could not be higher. This is a moment for bold leadership and unwavering commitment to the principles that unite us all as human beings.\nAlan Clements is author, Human Rights Activist, Investigative Journalist and Former Buddhist Monk and co-author of 'Burma's Revolution of the Spirit: The Struggle for Democratic Freedom and Dignity'.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat is your budget range for purchasing a condominium?\nEkkamai-Thong Lor\nSathorn-Silom\nChidlom-Siam\nBang Na\nChinatown\nAri\nRiverside\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nMyanmar\nSuu kyi\nBangladesh\nRohingya\nDemocracy\nDo you like the content of this article?\n29\n3\nCOMMENT\n(7)",

(Photo: Apichart Jinakul)\nNEW YORK - As the\nDemocratic Party\nunites behind\nUS Vice-President Kamala Harris\n, the nation's first Asian-American and African-American woman to be nominated for president by a major political party, many Asian-Americans say they feel increasingly emboldened and optimistic that their voices will be heard.\nDemocrats in general have been energised since US President Joe Biden, 81, stepped aside a month ago following a disastrous debate performance against the Republican candidate, former president Donald Trump. Biden's endorsement of Harris, 59, sparked memes on social media platforms and record fundraising for her.\nAmong the Asian-American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) community in particular, it is more pronounced and personal as they see someone who understands them breaking through the \"bamboo ceiling\".\nADVERTISEMENT\nAds powered by\n\"The excitement is unparalleled,\" said New York State Senator John Liu, a convention delegate, speaking by telephone just off the floor in Chicago. \"Asian-Americans still feel invisible all too often.\nRELATED\nopinion\nShould Ukraine have nuclear weapons too?\nworld\nTrump taps US Senator Marco Rubio for secretary of state, sources say\n\"But having one of our own in the White House [would] mean the world.

(Photo: South China Morning Post)\nAccording to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), in 2019, there were 158 federal anti-Asian hate crimes recorded in the US. But as Covid-19 spread, that figure rose to 279 in 2020 and 746 in 2021, before falling back to 499 in 2022.\nSeparately, the civic group Stop AAPI Hate received more than 11,000 self-reported incidents between March 2020 and May 2023, mostly involving harassment, bullying, shunning and other forms of discrimination.\nThere was also the launch by his Justice Department of its China Initiative, a programme targeting potential espionage in academia that critics said amounted to racial profiling. The Biden administration ended the programme.\n\"Trump's been a disaster for the community. He's been a major factor in the unprecedented rise of anti-Asian hate, scapegoating,\" Liu said, noting that it was still a current issue, with Trump citing the \"China virus\" during his meandering 90-minute speech accepting the Republican nomination last month in Milwaukee.\n\"This is a guy who invented a new anti-Asian slur, 'kung flu'. So the community does not forget that.\"\nRace has inserted itself into the contest in other ways.\nLate last month Trump provocatively suggested that Harris - whose father was born in Jamaica and whose mother in Southern India - \"happened to turn black\" and was playing down her Asian heritage for political expediency.\n\"She was always of Indian heritage,\" Trump told a National Association of Black Journalists convention. \"And now she wants to be known as black. So, I don't know, is she Indian or is she black?\"\nUS Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff, from left, US Vice President Kamala Harris and US President Joe Biden attend the Democratic National Convention (DNC) at the United Center in Chicago, Illinois, US, on Monday. (Photo: Bloomberg)\nSupport for Harris is hardly unanimous, given the wide diversity within the AAPI community. According to a July survey conducted by APIAVote, AAPI Data, Asian-American Advancing Justice and AARP - released before Biden dropped out of the race \u2013 31% of Asian voters said they would vote for Trump compared with 46% for Biden.\nThe survey found that Asian-Americans believed the Republican Party did marginally better on issues related to national security, immigration, inflation and crime, while Democrats did significantly better on abortion, healthcare and gun control.\nHarris supporters said that her candidacy - and potential win - would vindicate the community's centuries-long struggle to become more politically and culturally visible in the US and would help to shed long-standing tropes as the \"model minority\" and \"eternal outsiders\".\nAsian-Americans are the fastest-growing ethnic group in the US, and the fastest-growing voting bloc, increasing by 15%, or about 2 million eligible voters, in the past four years. They are also well represented in many swing states pivotal to the November 5 election.\n\"The political influence of AAPI voters is only growing, with the nomination of Kamala Harris for president as the latest milestone in our community's progress,\" said New York State Senator Iwen Chu, the first Asian-American woman to be elected to that legislature.\n\"Now it is time for us to band together,\" Chu, also a delegate to the Democratic convention, added.\nAccording to the survey, the Asian communities most favourable toward Trump were Vietnamese, Filipinos and Japanese, while those who viewed him most unfavourably were Chinese and Koreans. Overall, more than two-thirds of Asian-American voters reported worrying about hate crimes, harassment and discrimination.\n\"As the fastest-growing voting bloc in the nation, we must not forget the progress made and the work that needs to be continued,\" US Representative Grace Meng, a New York Democrat, said.\n\"This is an election where the Asian-American community will have a more critical impact than ever before,\" Liu added.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat hotel facilities are most important to you when choosing accommodation?\nSwimming pool\nFitness center\nRestaurants and bars\nMassage and spa\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nKamala harris\nUnited states\nElections\nRace\nAsian\nAfrican\nDo you like the content of this article?\n24\n54\nCOMMENT\n(116)",

(Photo: Bank of Thailand)\nThailand\u2019s central bank is poised to keep the policy rate at a decade high this week as the economy gathers some steam but uncertainty about a 145-billion-baht handout may prompt a fresh wave of rate-cut pressure.\nPaetongtarn Shinawatra, the new prime minister and the third member of the Shinawatra clan to lead Thailand, has pledged to lift the nation out of an \u201ceconomic crisis\u201d even as she said that the key stimulus promised by her predecessor needs further study.\nLike the ousted premier Srettha Thavisin \u2014 she may lean on the Bank of Thailand to lower borrowing costs. While Ms Paetongtarn has yet to make any public remarks about the BoT since winning a parliament vote Friday, she criticised it in May for pushing back against Mr Srettha\u2019s calls for a rate cut. She described the central bank\u2019s autonomy as an \u201cobstacle\u201d to reviving the economy.\nADVERTISEMENT\n\u201cThe pressure on the central bank will likely remain as long as the economy is not in good shape,\u201d said Somprawin Manprasert, chief economist at Siam Commercial Bank. \u201cThe government will continue to push for coordination between fiscal and monetary policies as well as policy accommodation.\u201d\nThe BoT is expected to leave its benchmark rate unchanged for a fifth straight meeting on Wednesday by all but one of 24 economists, according to a Bloomberg News survey. One sees a quarter-point cut to 2.25%.\nRELATED\nbusiness\nPaetongtarn dumps 15% VAT plan\nthailand\nSia Piang out of jail, dept confirms\nSoutheast Asia\u2019s second-largest economy grew 2.3% in April to June from a year earlier, the fastest pace in five quarters. Yet that\u2019s unlikely to ease the pressure on the BoT to cut, said Bloomberg Economics\u2019 Tamara Henderson.\nInterference\n\u201cUnder the hood, domestic demand decelerated. What\u2019s more, the new prime minister, appears to have the same penchant for central bank interference,\u201d Ms Henderson said in an Aug 19 note.\nWith Ms Paetongtarn sowing doubts about the cash stimulus, any flareup in tensions between the government and central bank will add to jitters of financial markets still reeling from recent political upheavals. Markets were rattled during the months of stand-off between Mr Srettha and the BoT, with central bankers not just resisting rate cuts but also opposing the cash handout.\nIt doesn\u2019t help that former Shinawatra leaders have a history of clashing with the central bank.\nMs Paetongtarn\u2019s father Thaksin and her aunt Yingluck both adopted populist policies to achieve higher growth rates. Both also exerted pressure on the central bank.\nIn 2001, Thaksin fired the central bank governor after the official resisted raising interest rates. And Yingluck\u2019s government had mounted a campaign during her term to push the BoT to lower rates.\nMs Paetongtarn is inheriting an economy that\u2019s lagged the growth rates of its neighbours in the past decade, hobbled by massive household debt and slow recovery of businesses from the pandemic.\nThailand last saw annual economic expansion above 5% during the term of Yingluck, before almost a decade of military-backed rule. That\u2019s a tall order for Ms Paetongtarn as some segments struggle. The once dynamic Thai manufacturing sector, for one, has been reeling from an influx of cheap imports mostly from China.\nOutsized influence\nMs Paetongtarn\u2019s approach on the central bank\u2019s independence bears watching also because of her father\u2019s outsized influence.\nEven before Ms Paetongtarn was officially declared as the new leader, Thaksin was cited by a local media to have told his daughter to abandon the cash handout to shield his daughter from any adverse legal fallout.\n\u201cIf the digital wallet project is dropped, and not replaced by any material economic stimulus, this would open up downside risks to the growth outlook and raise the odds of an earlier-than-expected rate cut,\u201d Krystal Tan, an economist at Australia &amp; New Zealand Banking Group.\nThe new government may also seek a tighter grip on the central bank by getting its nominee as the next chairman when the incumbent completes his term next month. Even if the BoT chair doesn\u2019t have an influence over monetary policy, the official can evaluate the governor\u2019s performance as well as have a say on the composition of the Monetary Policy Committee.\nMr Srettha\u2019s 11 months in office also saw his aides including Finance Minister Pichai Chunhavajira seeking an upward revision in the central bank\u2019s 1% to 3% inflation target. That was also seen by analysts as another strategy to spur rate cuts.\n\u201cIt certainly appears that tensions between the government and the central bank will persist until the latter starts a gradual normalisation of policy,\u201d said Miguel Chanco, an economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics Ltd who expects a rate cut on Wednesday. \u201cThese tensions could be mitigated if the new PM decides to scrap the controversial digital wallet scheme.\u201d\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat is your budget range for renting a condominium?\nUnder 10,000 THB/month\n10,000 - 20,000 THB/month\n20,000 - 40,000 THB/month\n40,000 - 60,000 THB/month\nOver 60,000 THB/month\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nPaetongtarn\nThai politics\nThailand\nBank of thailand\nThai economy\nDo you like the content of this article?\n9\n63\nCOMMENT\n(8)",

Thailand's growth rates in the first quarter of 2024 fell behind all Asean member countries except Myanmar. These facts cast serious doubts on the efficacy of traditional economic development strategies. The primary goal of enhancing the well-being of Thai citizens is at stake.\nThis article adopts a system dynamics approach, a comprehensive method and proposes actionable solutions. It focuses on four critical subsystems: political, demographic, social, and economic.\nIn the political realm, policy decisions and governance structures directly affect economic growth, demographic trends, and social stability. For instance, political stability and effective governance can create a regulatory environment that attracts higher-quality FDI, boosting economic growth. Conversely, ineffective public affairs management and political turmoil deter FDI, undermine its impact, destabilise the economy, and exacerbate social tensions.\nADVERTISEMENT\nDemographics shape economic and social outcomes, such as population growth, age distribution, and migration patterns. A growing youthful population can provide a robust labour force, driving economic expansion.\nHowever, if the economy cannot absorb this labour force, it may lead to high unemployment, social unrest, and increased political pressure. On the other hand, an ageing population may strain social services and economic productivity, necessitating political interventions to address the needs of older persons to maintain financial stability. Additionally, inward or outward migration patterns can significantly impact the labour market and economic and social dynamics.\nEconomic conditions impact political governance, human capital, and social services. Economic growth funds social programmes and contributes to political stability, creating a positive feedback loop. Conversely, downturns lead to budget cuts, reducing social service quality and increasing political tensions. Financial policies also influence migration, as people seek better opportunities, thus affecting demographics.\nThailand requires a national leader skilled in system dynamic management, capable of creating and capitalising on positive feedback loops across critical subsystems. Positive feedback loops amplify beneficial interactions, such as effective governance improving economic performance, which enhances social services, leading to a healthier, more educated population that supports further economic growth.\nConversely, negative feedback loops can worsen political instability, leading to economic decline, reduced social services, and deteriorating demographic conditions. Understanding these interactions and feedback mechanisms is crucial for developing holistic and sustainable solutions to Thailand's challenges.\nAmong many dimensions, the national leader must understand the concept of a leverage point to identify where to begin impactful change. In Thailand, the political subsystem is the critical leverage point. Addressing political stability and governance can initiate positive feedback loops, enhancing economic performance, social services, and overall societal well-being, leading to sustainable development. The leader's understanding and effective use of this leverage point will be crucial in driving the necessary changes.\nAside from possessing a system-dynamic management perspective, the leader of the future Thailand must be transformative, visionary, and passionate about national prosperity and the well-being of all citizens. Such a leader will inspire and drive comprehensive reforms, ensuring sustainable development and a brighter future for the nation. This transformative leadership is crucial for inspiring hope and confidence in Thailand's economic future.\nTo move into the future, we must analyse our past. Since 1932, when it adopted a Western-style constitutional democratic monarchy, Thailand has predominately been ruled directly by a coup leader or by a person chosen by the military junta. While these leaders were respectable, they were more interested in protecting the status quo, particularly of the ruling class and high-ranking bureaucrats.\nThe sectoral management approaches of the past must become more active and suitable for dealing with dynamic, complex, and interconnected challenges. Their contributions, though significant, were limited and not necessarily cumulative. Some of them were at odds with each other. Consequently, Thailand has yet to move very far forward.\nThailand can learn valuable lessons from the transformative experiences of China, Singapore, and South Korea, each applying a systematic management approach to political transformation to become economic powerhouses.\nThese nations prioritised political stability as the bedrock for economic and social development. For instance, under Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore established a meritocratic and corruption-free government, which fostered a stable and predictable environment for business and foreign investment. Similarly, Deng Xiaoping's China maintained political control while decentralising economic decision-making, allowing local governments to tailor policies that spurred rapid industrial growth.\nPark Chung-hee's authoritarian yet strategic governance in South Korea focused on coordinated Five-Year Plans that synchronised industrial, educational, and infrastructural development. This comprehensive planning ensured robust social services and technological advancements supported economic growth.\nCommon to all three nations was the emphasis on building strong institutions that upheld law and order, reduced corruption, and facilitated efficient governance. These leaders also understood the importance of inclusive development, ensuring that economic benefits were widely shared to maintain social cohesion and public support.\nBy adopting these principles, Thailand can develop a holistic strategy integrating political reforms with economic and social policies. This includes promoting meritocracy, strengthening institutions, and implementing long-overdue strategic political transformation. Such an approach will drive economic growth and enhance social well-being and political stability, positioning Thailand as a leading economic force in the region.\nPeerasit Kamnuansilpa\nKhon Kaen University Dean\nPeerasit Kamnuansilpa is Dean, College of Local Administration Khon Kaen University.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nHow important are environmental sustainability practices (e.g., eco-friendly rooms, waste reduction) when choosing accommodation in Thailand?

The partnership also aims to \"improve the response time of the voice system\" and \"expand the user cases in voice [interaction], navigation and entertainment\", the statements said.\nADVERTISEMENT\nAt a time when Western tech firms like Apple and Dell are moving some of their supply chain out of China, Mercedes-Benz vowed its ongoing commitment to China. The German company's China executive vice-president Wang Xin said in the statement that the firm \"is increasing its research and development investment in China\" and \"continues to expand and deepen its cooperation with leading Chinese technology companies\".\nMercedes-Benz said it would \"expand the collaboration\" with Volcano Engine in the future. Cooperation between the two firms dates back to 2023, when ByteDance's Volcano Cheyu app - which gives passengers access to its Douyin short video and Jinri Toutiao news apps - was made available on the Mercedes-Benz E-class, long wheelbase model in China.\nRELATED\nopinion\nCrossings chaos\nthailand\nLawyer Sittra's employees held in B39m theft case\nThe latest deal comes a week after the German carmaker received approval from Beijing to conduct level-4 autonomous driving tests on the city's roads and expressways, the first international carmaker to obtain such a permit in the Chinese capital.\nByteDance, which has made AI development one of its priorities since OpenAI's ChatGPT changed the game when it was launched in November 2022, has been promoting the Doubao LLM family, which was launched in May with prices lower than its peers.\nAt the same time, ByteDance announced an \"automobile LLM ecosystem alliance\" with more than 20 carmakers including local firms Geely and Great Wall Motor to expand its influence in the industry.

Between commodities exporters and import-substitute industries, Thailand became a successful export-led economy, joining the ranks of other regional \"industrial tigers,\" including Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThailand's successful repudiation of the domino theory, which in essence was a victory over the expansion of communism, came about through the dual approach of its military alliance with the United States and its economic partnership with Japan.\nRELATED\nsports\nIshii's army ready to strike\nthailand\nB300bn allocated for six double-track railway projects\nThroughout the Cold War, Thailand and Japan shared a similar worldview, a common sense of purpose, and a joint determination to meet the challenges of development and the threat of communism's expansion.\nThe historical differences and grievances between the countries were not forgotten but instead were set aside to move forward together. Without this historical baggage weighing them down, the countries could maintain affinity and fraternity with each other, where each country's royal family demonstrated this closeness and warmth at both the personnel and official levels, which helped cement the relationship.\nIt is important to note that in the early years of Thailand's road to industrialisation, Japan was integral through investment into their import substitution industries. By the late 1970s and the early 1980s, Thailand recognised the importance of advancing its industrialisation process. At the same time, the West was pressuring Japan to revalue the Yen to lessen its competitive impact on European and American industries in terms of domestic production and export. With rising labour costs at home and more expensive products, it became prudent for Japan to relocate its factories abroad.\nUpon Thailand's eventual move from import-substitution industries to export-led industries, Japan was in a prime position to invest accordingly. In order to prepare for such a fundamental change, in the early 1980s, Thailand prepared a white paper on restructuring the Thailand-Japan economic relationship, which was then used as a backbone for negotiation, where Thailand demanded that Japan materially assist with their move to export-led industries.\nThailand also stipulated that Japan no longer hold strings attached to their grant aid or soft loans, so that the bidding for projects financed by Japan would be open to all companies, regardless of nationality. This success story was maintained for nearly two decades, incorporating the end of the Cold War and the first decade after, and included about an 8-13% annual growth rate.\nThe timing of Thailand's industrial changes also brought about one of the most impactful changes to the global economic order, as China experienced unprecedented economic growth into a global factory for manufacturing goods while also developing an assertiveness bent on avenging its \"century of humiliation.\" This greatly expanded economic role helped fuel China's desire and attempts to challenge and rid the world of Western influence and dominance, led by the US.\nChina is not alone in materially impacting global trade since the end of the Cold War. India has become a major player in the global economy upon their discarding of a socialist-oriented economic regime. Vietnam has been a fast learner and practitioner of a market economy. Indonesia has achieved great political stability, along with immense natural resources and a large population filled with youth looking to urbanise.\nWith so many countries taking a larger seat at the global economic table, Thailand ostensibly faces more competitors, resulting in Japan having more options for economic partnership. In this environment, it is necessary for Thailand to rethink, review, and undertake stock-taking about its economic relationship with Japan. The automotive industry was key to Thailand's industrialisation as well as to Thai-Japanese industrial cooperation.\nBut Japan has yet to sufficiently focus on the electric vehicle, while China continues to make significant progress in both acknowledgement of its importance and its manufacturing. The Thai automotive industry seems to be suspended in the air, as there has been little, if any, discussion between each party on the possibility of cooperating within the green, biotechnology, or information technology industries. This purgatorial existence between Thailand and Japan in such crucial industries and areas of technology seemingly necessitates a novel white paper to be drafted to chart the course of updated economic cooperative activities. But is there a will to do so? There is a perception amongst the Japanese that Thailand is more interested in a relationship with China, in part due to their lack of attention paid to Japan.\nIn addition to reasonable concerns of Thailand's uncertainty, lack of vision, and enthusiasm moving forward, there is also a political-cum-security issue that seems to occupy the hearts and minds of Japan's political leadership. As the country's economic livelihood depends on safe, free, and secured sea lanes, the multifaceted threat of China, North Korea, and Russia is particularly worrisome. In response, Japan has increased its defence budget while also investing in the arms industry with the intention of exporting such goods. It has strengthened its security alliances with the US, South Korea, Australia, and India while also strongly supporting the Philippines as they stand up to China's bullying and coercive tactics in the South China Sea, which are also in contrast to established international law. Japan has joined forces with the United Kingdom and Italy to produce a new generation of jet aircraft. They are also contemplating the Aukus partnership between Australia, the UK, and the US on nuclear technology.\nThailand, in the context of the East China Sea and South China Sea, is not a frontline state like the Philippines and Vietnam. From the Japanese strategic perspective, Thailand is a hinterland which also has the US as a security umbrella.\nAs both the regional and international environments have changed, Thailand is not on Japan's radar as it once was, and it is no longer a priority. It is, therefore, up to Thailand to recompose and reposition itself and find a niche of activities that might be of interest and useful to Japan. The Thai side must realise that the two countries are drifting apart. But all is not lost. Through their history and affinity with intelligence, friendship, and success, the two countries can surely find new areas of cooperation. Friendship and goodwill must be maintained as a responsibility.\nKasit Piromya\nAPHR Board Member\nKasit Piromya is a Board Member of Asean Parliamentarians for Human Rights (APHR), and is a former Thai foreign minister.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nHow much do hotel reviews (e.g., TripAdvisor, Google Reviews) influence your accommodation choice?\nVery important, I always check reviews before booking\nSomewhat important, I check reviews if I\u2019m unsure\nNeutral, I don\u2019t pay much attention to reviews\nNot important at all, I don\u2019t check reviews\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nThailand\nJapan\nPartnership\nDo you like the content of this article?\n23\n3\nCOMMENT",

These decisions by recent and current governments offer a clear view of the country's diplomatic trajectory in an increasingly uncertain world.\nThe global power landscape is in constant flux, shaped by various geopolitical and geo-economic forces. With the ongoing Ukraine-Russia conflict and the Gaza-Israel crisis, the Indo-Pacific is poised to become a potential battleground for great powers vying for extending influence.\nIn this context, Thailand's approach is straightforward. Bangkok has used emerging frameworks to engage with partners without bias, avoiding the risks of brinksmanship.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently organised a public discussion involving academics, media, and stakeholders to explore Thailand's enthusiasm for joining multilateral cooperative frameworks.\nRELATED\nlife\nFestive buffets await at Ventisi this December\nlife\nThe season of giving\nThese include the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (Ipef) and potential partnerships with Brics (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) and the OECD (Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development).\nThe ministry has not stayed idle. Since early June, it has been reported that Thailand has chosen a side by wanting to join Brics, which is perceived as an anti-West group.\nTo understand Thailand's behaviour, it is pivotal to understand what factors or personalities were behind its moves to join Ipef, OECD, and Brics.\nThailand's decision to join Ipef in May 2022 was expected. The country was one of the five US allies in the Indo-Pacific. Bangkok was also then chairing Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec). As Apec host, it sought to maintain its relationships and participate in the US-led regional economic initiative at a crucial moment. Thailand is one of seven Asean members, comprising Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Vietnam, joining Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Korea, Fiji, India and the US in Ipef.\nUnder the Prayut government, Thailand aligned with the US strategy of supporting its allies while promoting resilient production and supply chains. The country wanted more recognition from the West, which was the main source of investment, and improved economic standards and governance. Thailand has mitigated the economic slowdown post-Covid-19 as it has already integrated into the growing supply chain network in the East Asian region.\nBangkok wants to reduce and avoid risks, and the Ipef is a good shield. Eight of its top 10 export markets are Ipef members, accounting for 54% of Thailand's total exports. Thailand was excluded from the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP).\nSince its inception, Ipef has made significant progress, signing agreements on supply chains, a clean and fair economy, and an overarching agreement on Ipef. An Ipef council was recently established at the ministerial level to oversee the Ipef planning. However, the first pillar, fair and resilient trade, remains under negotiation, falling under the purview of a US trade representative.\nAmid the upcoming US presidential election in November, Ipef members are anxious about the future of this framework, hoping it would not suffer the same fate as the Trans-Pacific Partnership, from which the US withdrew in 2017. No matter the November election outcome, Ipef members now recognise that maintaining US engagement in the region is crucial for both security and economic reasons.\nUnder the Pheu Thai-led government, Thailand officially submitted a letter of intent to begin the OECD accession process in February. Surprisingly, the country also applied for Brics membership a few months later. These moves drew criticism from local and foreign think tanks and scholars, puzzled by Thailand's simultaneous pursuit of two organisations representing opposing poles.\nShortly after the Brics application, the OECD Council agreed to proceed with Thailand's accession process, to the delight of Saranrom Palace. Truth be told, senior policymakers feared the Brics move would delay or jeopardise the country's OECD admission. However, as it turned out, the council supported Thailand's bid, given the long-standing cooperation spanning four decades. In April, former deputy prime minister and foreign minister Parnpree Bahiddha-Nukara made a good case for Thailand's move toward the OECD at its headquarters in Paris.\nThailand's engagement with Ipef, alongside its pursuit of Brics and OECD memberships, demonstrates a strategic effort to diversify its economic partnerships and align with various political systems.\nIn addition, granted the timing, Thailand's decision to join Ipef was also driven by the desire to align with President Joe Biden's strategic push and maintain the US as its largest export market. Bangkok also views Ipef as a political tool for economic gains, enhancing trade and governance standards. As such, Bangkok has become part of the US \"friendshoring\" strategy, encouraging allies to build networks and supply chains together.\nThai politics is also unique, and Western countries are doubtful about the true nature of Thai democracy. A good case study was last week's statements from the US, EU, UK, Australia, and New Zealand, expressing concerns over the Constitutional Court's decision to dissolve the Move Forward Party for attempting to amend Section 112 of the Criminal Code, the lese majeste law. The EU's statement was the most succinct in reiterating the importance of allowing all legitimately elected MPs to fulfil their parliamentary mandates, regardless of party affiliation.\nMeanwhile, Thailand's dual applications to Brics and the OECD present more significant challenges due to their differing ideologies and values. Bangkok-based diplomats were perplexed by the Thai strategy.\nInterestingly, the push for Brics membership was made after Mr Parnpree's abrupt resignation during the cabinet reshuffle in late April. This extraordinary move was influenced by the Pheu Thai Party's inner circle, including former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra. He maintained close ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin when he served as the Thai prime minister from 2001 to 2006. Russia is also the current chair of Brics. During Thaksin's tenure, the two countries agreed on a visa-free policy in 2003.\nThe Brics decision also responded to Russia's two invitations for Thailand to attend the Brics-related meetings as observers. The newly appointed foreign minister, Maris Sangiampongsa, attended the Brics foreign ministerial meeting in Nizhny Novgorod. Paetongtarn Shinawatra, the Pheu Thai Party chief, attended the Brics Parliamentary Forum in Vladivostok in June.\nIn retrospect, the ideal time to apply for Brics membership would have been next year, under India's chairmanship. Thailand and India have special relations in terms of geopolitics, regional cooperation, and culture. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scheduled to visit Thailand in early September. This explains why the Srettha government has remained quiet about Brics. Government spokesman Chai Wacharonke, who had ensured the local press that Thailand would become a Brics member in October, has now become tight-lipped.\nIndeed, Thailand was informed by a senior Russian foreign ministry official that there was a postponement during the Brics summit meeting in Kazan on Oct 22-24. Last August, Brics admitted five new members, which requires time for consolidation. At least 40 countries have expressed interest in joining Brics.\nHowever, Brics may allow cooperation under a \"Brics Plus\" scheme for potential new members. The summit could also create a new group called the \"Circle of Friends,\" enabling aspiring partners to share their perspectives with Brics.\nIn contrast to the Brics process, the OECD application was handled carefully by the Paris-based headquarters. In principle, foreign policymakers and other agencies generally vet each diplomatic decision professionally. However, as the Brics case showed, there could be some aberrations.\nKavi Chongkittavorn\nA veteran journalist on regional affairs\nKavi Chongkittavorn is a veteran journalist on regional affairs\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat is your budget range for purchasing a condominium?\nEkkamai-Thong Lor\nSathorn-Silom\nChidlom-Siam\nBang Na\nChinatown\nAri\nRiverside\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nInternational order\nDo you like the content of this article?\n8\n48\nCOMMENT\n(7)",

Such packages have been openly sold on Chinese online platforms, he said.\nMr Sisdivachr said the new 60-day visa-free scheme for foreign tourists from 93 nations would allow more foreigners to illegally work in Thailand.\nTypically, those visiting Thailand for tourism tend to stay less than a month, he said.\nSome foreigners may find a way to set up a nominee tour business to reap the benefits from Thailand's flourishing tourism industry, said Mr Sisdivachr.\n\"Cheap travel packages have left a negative image of Thai tourism, instead of depicting it as a high-quality destination as promised by the government,\" he said.\nA billboard at Bangkok's Huai Khwang intersection claimed to offer multinational passport and citizenship application services in Chinese language. The ad caused an uproar on social media last month and was later removed. (Photo courtesy of Pai Charudul Facebook account)\nNOMINEE PREVENTION\nJaturon Phakdeewanit, director-general of the Tourism Department, said the department already completed inspections of around 60% of the businesses suspected to be operated by nominees, with a total of 100 companies on the list.\nFrom March to July, the licences of 38 tour companies were revoked.\nPrior to the visa-free scheme, the Tourism Department collaborated with the Consular Affairs Department to share a list of licensed tour companies, aiming to reduce the visa approval time for those using legal operators.\nHowever, when the government announced the visa-free scheme, this method was cancelled.\nTo seek alternative methods, Mr Jaturon said the department assigned the Provincial Office of Tourism and Sports in 77 provinces to inspect tour companies and ask for tour group job orders that include tour itineraries, instead of leaving this duty to department staff and Tourist Police.\nHe said he believes these preventive measures and punishments for nominee businesses are sufficient.\nThose convicted as nominees are banned from operating a tour business for five years. Those convicted under criminal law could face a maximum two-year prison term and up to 100,000 baht in fines.\nIllegal foreign owners can be charged with immigration violations and working without a work permit.\nWhile some operators suggest increasing the guarantee fee for licensed tour companies to prevent nominees, Mr Jaturon said this method may not help because most foreign owners have lots of liquidity.\nIf the guarantee amount is too high, it could limit the opportunities of small operators to compete, he said.\nTo prevent zero-dollar and price-dumping packages, the department set a minimum price for tour packages, particularly for Chinese tourists, of 1,000 baht per night.\nTourists admire the sights along the Chao Phraya River aboard a hop on-hop off boat in Bangkok. Apichart Jinakul\nEATING UP THE COMPETITION\nThe Thai Restaurant Association warns that foreign restaurants pose a greater threat to Thai restaurateurs.\nThaniwan Kulmongkol, president of the association, said foreign restaurants are mushrooming in Thailand and their expansion is poised to accelerate because of government indifference and a failure to promote the local industry.\nIn the past year, new Chinese restaurants and supermarkets surged in many parts of Bangkok such as Huai Khwang district, teeming with Chinese hot pot eateries and bustling shops, including chain branches from different regions of the mainland.\nThe influx raised concerns among locals about Chinese influence and inflation, as some Chinese establishments source the majority of their raw materials from that country, even furniture used to decorate businesses, said Ms Thaniwan.\nThis phenomenon reminds her of Chinese zero-dollar tours, where Thailand barely benefits from tourism arrivals, sparking concern that some of these restaurants might be nominees for illegal activities.\n\"Bringing ingredients from the motherland may add to the authenticity of dishes, but this practice will affect the Thai restaurant industry,\" said Ms Thaniwan.\nShe said opening a business in a foreign country such as China is not easy for Thai firms because of stringent regulations and mandates, yet starting a foreign business in Thailand is more conducive.\nMs Thaniwan urged the authorities to tighten law enforcement of such establishments.\n\"The authorities should strictly regulate nominee restaurants through in-depth investigations of business registrations and licensing, as well as work permits,\" she said.\n\"If there is a silver lining to this story, at least the young generation is starting to be aware of this kind of business model.\"\nFRESH CONCERNS\nThe Federation of Thai Industries (FTI) is alert to the nominee issue, which it said will increase problems for Thai businesses now struggling to deal with the influx of Chinese goods into the Thai market.\nFor example, one steel factory is suspected of being run by a Chinese entrepreneur through a Thai executive, said Kriengkrai Thiennukul, chairman of the FTI.\nThis factory was allegedly previously owned by a Thai, but ownership later changed hands, raising concerns about usage of nominees to run businesses owned by foreigners, he said.\nNominee businesses would have an unwelcome impact on government tax collection, which affects the country's revenue, said Mr Kriengkrai.\n\"We are worried about Thai nominees working for foreign entrepreneurs,\" he said.\n\"This could deal another blow to local businesses, especially those run by small and medium-sized enterprises.\"\nThe nominee issue is a trade and investment concern for companies doing business in both China and Thailand, according to the federation.\nTo solve these problems, the Joint Standing Committee for Commerce, Industry and Banking is in talks with Chinese authorities about a plan to set up the Thai-Chinese Centre for Business Sustainability to ensure businesses operate under the laws of the two countries, said Mr Kriengkrai.\nCRACKDOWN BEGINS\nAuramon Supthaweethum, director-general of the Department of Business Development (DBD), reported on the progress of investigations into Thai legal entities that may be considered nominees, meaning they use Thai nationals as proxy shareholders to conceal foreign ownership and conduct business in Thailand. This violates the provisions of the Foreign Business Act of 1999.\nThis year the department plans to examine 26,019 nominee cases across four business sectors: tourism and related businesses, real estate trading, hotels and resorts, and logistics.\nThese investigations are in six major tourist provinces: Chiang Mai, Chon Buri, Surat Thani, Phuket, Bangkok and Prachuap Khiri Khan.\nAs a result of investigations, the department identified 495 legal entities that require on-site inspection.\nThe DBD, in collaboration with partner agencies, has conducted on-site inspections of 221 legal entities focusing on establishment location, source of funding for business operations, and shareholding arrangements.\nMs Auramon said anyone who assists, supports, engages in business with, or holds shares on behalf of a foreigner to help them conduct business in violation or circumvention of the law faces severe penalties.\nThese penalties include imprisonment for up to three years, a fine ranging from 100,000 to 1 million baht, or both, as well as a fine ranging from 10,000 to 50,000 baht per day until the violations have been resolved.\nThe DBD partnered with six agencies -- the Tourism Department, the tourism permanent secretary's office, Tourism and Sports Ministry, Department of Special Investigation, Tourist Police Bureau and the Immigration Bureau -- to sign a memorandum of understanding on Dec 13, 2023.\nThe agreement calls for a joint operations centre to solve the problem of nominee tourism businesses, focusing of four areas of cooperation: business registration and licensing, information sharing, supervision and prevention, and tourism business promotion.\nShe said the goal is to raise the standard and quality of tourism businesses to ensure sustainability.\n\"Entrepreneurs who can identify companies that are at risk from nominee businesses are encouraged to inform the department for investigation and further action, in cooperation with related agencies,\" said Ms Auramon.\nVisitors from China are pictured upon arrival in Bangkok.

George Kraychyk/A24\nHappy Mother's Day! A day dedicated to celebrating the women who nurture, guide and love us unconditionally. Mothers -- our caregivers, confidants and sometimes our fiercest critics -- hold a unique place in our lives. Their roles are as multifaceted as the relationships they foster with their children, which are often marked by a blend of deep affection, tension and unspoken understanding. It's no wonder that the intricate dynamics of these relationships have been explored so compellingly in cinema.\nRelationships, in general, are complex, but those within a family carry a distinct weight. We don't choose our family; we are born into it. This involuntary bond is a fertile ground for stories that delve into the emotional and psychological ties between mothers and their children. Whether a relationship is harmonious or strained, the bond between a mother and her child is often one of the most significant and complicated connections in life.\nMovies have a unique way of reflecting and amplifying these real-life dynamics. Through film, we can observe the nuances of relationships that may resonate deeply with our own experiences. They allow us to step back and view these bonds through a different lens, often revealing truths we might overlook in our day-to-day lives. This Mother's Day, what better way to reflect on these profound relationships than by watching films that capture their essence?\nADVERTISEMENT\nHere are six films that poignantly explore the mother-child relationship, each offering a unique perspective on the joys, challenges and emotional depths of this timeless bond.\nTerms Of Endearment.\n1. Terms Of Endearment (1983) Director: James L. Brooks\nTerms Of Endearment is a quintessential exploration of the mother-daughter relationship, capturing the intense emotional spectrum that often characterises such bonds. The film follows the lives of Aurora Greenway (Shirley MacLaine) and her daughter Emma (Debra Winger) over several decades, offering a raw and honest portrayal of their evolving relationship.\nAurora is a fiercely independent woman who, despite her overbearing nature, deeply loves her daughter. Their relationship is marked by frequent disagreements, yet an unbreakable bond underlies their conflicts. Aurora's protectiveness often clashes with Emma's desire for independence, leading to tensions that many can relate to. The film doesn't shy away from the complexities of motherhood, showing that love can be both nurturing and suffocating.\nAs Emma navigates her own journey through marriage, motherhood and illness, Aurora must learn to let go and accept her daughter's choices, even when they differ from her own. The film's emotional depth is further enhanced by the brilliant performances of MacLaine and Winger, whose chemistry brings their characters' relationship to life in a way that is both heartbreaking and uplifting.\nTerms Of Endearment won five Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Actress for MacLaine, cementing its place as a classic exploration of maternal love and its many facets. It's a film that reminds us that while no mother-daughter relationship is perfect, the bond they share is irreplaceable.\nThe Kids Are All Right.\n2. The Kids Are All Right (2010) Director: Lisa Cholodenko\nThe Kids Are All Right presents a modern take on family dynamics, focusing on the complexities of a same-sex couple raising two teenage children. The film introduces us to Nic (Annette Bening) and Jules (Julianne Moore), a married couple whose lives are turned upside down when their children, Joni (Mia Wasikowska) and Laser (Josh Hutcherson), seek out their biological father, Paul (Mark Ruffalo).\nAt its core, the film is a thoughtful exploration of what makes a family. Nic and Jules have built a loving home, but the arrival of Paul challenges their family's equilibrium. The film deftly navigates the shifting dynamics as the family members grapple with issues of identity, loyalty, and the meaning of parenthood.\nBening and Moore give remarkable performances as mothers who, despite their flaws, deeply care for their children and each other. The film doesn't present an idealised version of motherhood; instead, it offers a realistic portrayal of the struggles and joys of raising children in a non-traditional family. It highlights that the essence of family lies in the bonds of love and commitment, rather than biology alone.\nThe Kids Are All Right is a celebration of family in all its forms, showing that the challenges of parenthood are universal, regardless of the family structure. It's a film that resonates with the evolving understanding of what it means to be a mother in the 21st century.\nSaoirse Ronan and Laurie Metcalf in Lady Bird. HBO Asia\n3. Lady Bird (2017) Director: Greta Gerwig\nBefore last year's big hit Barbie, Lady Bird was Greta Gerwig's directorial debut effort. It's a tender and insightful coming-of-age story that captures the volatile yet loving relationship between a teenage girl and her mother. Set in Sacramento in 2002, the film follows Christine \"Lady Bird\" McPherson (Saoirse Ronan) as she navigates the trials of adolescence, yearning for freedom and self-expression.\nLady Bird's relationship with her mother Marion (Laurie Metcalf) is the heart of the film. Marion, a hard-working nurse, is pragmatic and sometimes critical, pushing Lady Bird to be practical about her future. Lady Bird, on the other hand, is headstrong and dreams of escaping her mundane life in Sacramento for the artistic and cultural promise of the East Coast. Their interactions are a mix of fierce arguments and tender moments, illustrating the push-pull dynamic that often characterises mother-daughter relationships.\nThe brilliance of Lady Bird lies in its authenticity. Gerwig, drawing from her own experiences, creates characters that feel real and relatable. The film doesn't offer easy resolutions but instead embraces the messiness of growing up and the complexities of maternal love. Ronan and Metcalf deliver nuanced performances that capture the deep, sometimes painful, love between a mother and daughter.\nLady Bird is a film that speaks to anyone who has experienced the tumultuous transition from adolescence to adulthood, and the evolving relationship with a mother during that time. It's a beautiful, honest portrayal of the challenges of understanding and being understood by the person who knows you best.\nThe Joy Luck Club.\n4. The Joy Luck Club (1993) Director: Wayne Wang\nBased on Amy Tan's bestselling novel, The Joy Luck Club is a powerful exploration of the mother-daughter relationship within the context of cultural identity and generational conflict. The film weaves together the stories of four Chinese-American women and their mothers, delving into the complexities of their relationships as they navigate the cultural divide between their Chinese heritage and their American upbringing.\nTold through a series of flashbacks, the film reveals the sacrifices made by the mothers as they fled China during tumultuous times, and the challenges faced by their daughters in reconciling their dual identities. The film beautifully captures the tension between the expectations of traditional Chinese culture and the desires for independence and self-expression that the daughters experience in America.\nAs the daughters learn more about their mothers' pasts, they begin to understand the motivations behind their actions and the depth of their love. The film highlights the often-unspoken sacrifices mothers make for their children, and the ways in which these sacrifices can shape the lives of future generations.\nThe Joy Luck Club is a poignant reminder of the enduring bond between mothers and daughters, even in the face of cultural and generational differences. It's a film that speaks to the universal experiences of love, sacrifice and the search for identity.\n5. Room (2015) Director: Lenny Abrahamson\nInspired by a harrowing true story, Room is a deeply emotional film that explores the intense bond between a mother and her child in the most extreme of circumstances. Brie Larson stars as Ma, a young woman who has been held captive in a small, windowless room for seven years, where she has raised her five-year-old son Jack (Jacob Tremblay), born as a result of her abduction.\nThe film is a powerful exploration of survival, resilience and the lengths a mother will go to protect her child. Despite the horrific circumstances, Ma creates a nurturing environment for Jack, transforming their confined space into a world of imagination and love. Her strength and resourcefulness are a testament to the power of maternal love.\nAs the film progresses, Ma and Jack's eventual escape and re-entry into the outside world pose new challenges, as they struggle to adapt to life beyond the room that has been their entire world. Larson's Oscar-winning performance captures the complexities of a mother's love -- fierce, protective and all-encompassing -- while Tremblay's portrayal of Jack is both heartbreaking and inspiring.\nRoom is a testament to the indomitable spirit of motherhood, illustrating the profound connection between a mother and her child, even in the darkest of circumstances. It's a film that lingers long after the credits roll, reminding us of the enduring power of love.\nMargot Robbie in I, Tonya. PR True Vision and HBO\n6. I, Tonya (2017) Director: Craig Gillespie\nI, Tonya offers a darkly comedic and unflinchingly honest portrayal of the complex relationship between figure skater Tonya Harding and her mother, LaVona Golden. The film chronicles Tonya's rise to fame and the infamous scandal that led to her downfall, but at its core, it's a story about the impact of an abusive, demanding mother on her daughter's life.\nMargot Robbie delivers a standout performance as Tonya, capturing the grit and determination of a young woman striving to succeed in a sport that often looked down on her working-class background. Allison Janney is equally compelling as LaVona, whose harsh and unrelenting methods push Tonya to excel but also scar her emotionally.\nThe film doesn't shy away from the darker aspects of their relationship, portraying LaVona as a figure whose love is conditional and whose support is laced with cruelty. Yet, it also explores the complicated ways in which Tonya seeks her mother's approval, despite the abuse.\nI, Tonya is a stark reminder of the ways in which a mother's influence can shape a child's identity and future, for better or worse. It's a film that challenges the traditional notions of maternal love, offering a gritty, real-world depiction of a mother-daughter relationship marred by dysfunction and ambition.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat is your preferred price range per night for accommodation in Bangkok?\n1,000 - 3,000 THB\n3,000 - 5,000 THB\n5,000 - 8,000 THB\nOver 8,000 THB\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nDo you like the content of this article?\n1\n5\nCOMMENT",

(Photo: en.kremlin.ru via Wikimedia Commons)\nHANOI - Vietnamese President To Lam was named on Saturday to the country\u2019s top position, general secretary of the ruling\nCommunist Party\nof Vietnam, succeeding Nguyen Phu Trong, who died two weeks ago.\nLam, 67, had temporarily taken on the party chief\u2019s duties on July 18, a day before Trong\u2019s death, as his health deteriorated.\nParty delegates unanimously supported Lam\u2019s nomination, officials told a press conference.\nADVERTISEMENT\nAds powered by\nAddressing the delegates, he vowed to inherit and promote Trong\u2019s legacy, make no changes to foreign policy, with a focus on achieving its socioeconomic development goals and continuing a campaign against graft.\nRELATED\nthailand\n51 Innovations Honoured at International Innovation Awards 2024 Ceremony&nbsp;\nbusiness\nChinese regulators target Temu owner\u2019s refund policy\n\u201cIn the coming time, the work on anti-corruption will be continued fiercely,\u201d Lam told the press conference. \u201cPersonally I feel fortunate that I have much experience in handling anti-graft campaign during the time I worked at the police ministry.\u201d\nVietnam, a major destination for manufacturing investment, has long been favoured by multinational corporations for its political stability, but experienced major turbulence in recent months that officials said was fuelled by the anti-graft effort.\nThe country does not formally have a paramount leader, but the head of the party has a more prominent role than others, after Trong beefed up its power during his 13-year tenure.\nLam, a career security officer, had been seen as long aiming to become party chief, with experts calling the presidency a stepping stone for the top job.\n\u201cIt is a sign of a temporary halt of internal fighting within the party,\u201d said Nguyen Khac Giang, a Vietnam expert at the Singapore think tank the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute.\n\u201cAlthough Lam vowed to push forward the anti-corruption campaign, the campaign may slow down a little as he may prioritise stabilising the party system before the party congress in 2026.\u201d\nIt was not immediately clear whether Lam would retain both top jobs until the legislative session ends in 2026, or whether a new president would be chosen.\nLam was elected president in May after leading the sweeping campaign of high-profile investigations against corruption as police minister. He replaced Vo Van Thuong, who had been in the job about a year when he quit amid accusations of unspecified wrongdoing.\nIf Lam retains both jobs, he may boost his powers and possibly adopt a more autocratic leadership style, officials have said, similar to that of Xi Jinping, who is China\u2019s party chief and state president.\nThat would be a change for Vietnam, which, unlike its far larger neighbour, has engaged in more collective decision-making, with leaders subject to multiple checks.\nUS maintains \u2018non-market economy\u2019 tag\nIn a related development, the US Commerce Department announced on Friday it would continue to classify Vietnam as a non-market economy, a decision disappointing to Hanoi, which Washington has been wooing in its efforts to push back against China.\nVietnam has long sought an upgrade, which would have reduced the punitive anti-dumping duties levied on non-market economies marked by heavy state influence. Only 12 other economies are labelled as non-market by Washington, including China, Russia, North Korea and Azerbaijan.\nA change in status has been opposed by US steelmakers, Gulf Coast shrimpers and honey farmers and members of the US Congress representing them, but backed by retailers and some other business groups.\nVietnam\u2019s Ministry of Industry and Trade said upgrading Vietnam would have been an objective and fair move.\n\u201cVietnam regrets that despite several positive improvements in the Vietnamese economy recently, the US Department of Commerce still has not recognised Vietnam as a market economy country,\u201d it said in a statement.\nVietnam has long argued it should be freed of the non-market label because of recent economic reforms, and it has said that retaining the moniker is bad for increasingly close two-way ties that Washington sees as a counterbalance to China.\nOpponents of an upgrade have countered that Hanoi\u2019s policy commitments have not been matched by concrete actions and it still operates as a planned economy governed by the Communist Party. They say Vietnam is increasingly being used as a manufacturing hub by Chinese firms to circumvent US curbs on imports from China.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhich app or platform do you usually use to book accommodations?\nBooking.com\nAgoda\nAirbnb\nTrip.com\nTraveloka\nExpedia\nSkyscanner\nDirectly with the accommodation\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nVietnam\nCommunist Party\nTo Lam\nDo you like the content of this article?\n1\n0\nCOMMENT\n(4)",

Despite the limited upside, the index held above the prior low of 1,281.\nKey catalysts in August will include second-quarter earnings reporting, with all results due by Aug 14. We forecast a strong 27% year-on-year increase in the aggregate net profit of the SET Index.\nAs well, investors will continue to monitor the US interest-rate outlook, after the Federal Reserve indicated this week that a reduction in September is possible. Recent economic and inflation reports point to the potential for as many as three cuts by year-end. Such moves could boost economic growth and attract foreign inflows to the Thai market.\nADVERTISEMENT\nLocal politics are a factor as always. The Constitutional Court will rule on the dissolution of the Move Forward Party on Aug 7 and on the ethics complaint against Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin on Aug 14. An outcome favourable to the PM could provide positive sentiment for the SET. On the economic front, in addition to the digital wallet programme, the government is expected to roll out more stimulus packages.\nKeep an eye on China as well. Following a once-every-five-years plenum gathering of top officials, Beijing has reaffirmed its commitment to economic stimulus, targeting 5% GDP growth in 2024. Increased consumption is a key focus.\nRELATED\nbusiness\nCGSI forecasts stagnant first-half for Thai stock market\nworld\nUS unveils $988m aid package for Ukraine including rockets and drones\nAUGUST OUTLOOK\nA break above 1,330 points could open an upside towards 1,340 or 1,360. However, given the historical significance of the 1,350 level as a strong support, a break above this level is seen as challenging for the SET. Should the index fail to breach the 1,330 level, a return to the 1,280-1,332 range is likely.\nIn terms of investment strategy, the short-term focus will be on stocks with strong earnings growth stories. Our top picks for August are:\nAURA (Buy, target 18.50 baht): We forecast 27% year-on-year growth in full-year net profit for the jewellery maker to 1.1 billion baht. Earnings momentum is expected to persist in the second half, fuelled by ongoing expansion and the thriving pawning segment. Notably, the pawning portfolio is projected to reach 4.2 billion baht by the end of 2024, compared with 2.7 billion a year earlier. Our target price is based on a 2024 price-earnings (PE) ratio of 23 times, or 0.5 standard deviation (SD) below the two-year average. An interest rate cut could further enhance profitability.\nCK (Buy, target 29 baht): We anticipate 25% year-on-year profit growth for the construction contractor to 1.8 billion baht in 2024, driven by core business and project execution. Looking ahead, we project continued growth of 17% to 2.1 billion baht in 2025. Large-scale projects like the Orange Line and Purple Line South rail projects in Bangkok, the Luang Prabang hydropower plant in Laos, and the Denchai-Chiang Rai-Chiang Khong double-track rail project offer significant upside for 2025.\nCKP (Buy, target 4.50 baht): We project a solid 21% year-on-year increase in core profit for the power producer to 1.8 billion baht in 2024, driven by the end of the El Ni\u00f1o influence and potential La Ni\u00f1a impact. Our target price is based on a discounted cash flow analysis using a 5.5% weighted average cost of capital with no terminal growth value. Key catalysts include a strong electricity generation season in the third quarter.\nCPAXT (Buy, target 36 baht): Our target price for the retail and wholesale operator is based on a 2024 PE ratio of 37 times (0.25 SD above the five-year average). Key catalysts include continued retail segment improvement.\nKTB (Buy, target 21 baht): Our target price for the bank is based on a 2024 price to book value (PBV) of 0.68 times, or 0.75 SD below the 10-year average. The current valuation of 0.57 times PBV is below its 10-year historical average, and the sector average of 0.6 times. Moreover, we believe the recent share price peak of 21 baht doesn't fully capture the bank's potential for future growth.\nMASTER (Buy, target 86 baht): We project robust 39% year-on-year growth in net profit to 579 million baht in 2024. Ongoing merger and acquisition exploration by the cosmetic surgery hospital operator could create an upside to our earnings forecast. Our target price is based on a 2024 PE of 45 times. Given the expected upward trend in earnings, the recent 23% stock price decline offers a compelling entry point.\nSPRC (Buy, target 10.50 baht): The refinery operator is poised for a big turnaround, with projected net profit of 4.9 billion baht in 2024, compared to a loss of 1.2 billion in 2023, driven by a higher gross refining margin, increased refinery intake and substantial oil stock gains. Our target price is based on a 2024 PBV of 1.13 times, positioned at 1.0 SD below the five-year average. The current stock price also offers an attractive dividend yield of 5.4% to 6.1% for the next two years.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat is your budget range for purchasing a condominium?\nUnder 2 million THB\n2 million - 4 million THB\n4 million - 7 million THB\n7 million - 10 million THB\nOver 10 million THB\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nStocks\nShares\nInvestment\nDo you like the content of this article?\n1\n2\nCOMMENT",

Growth of civilisation and prosperity of the West had been possible due to political stability and social harmony.\nJapan, South Korea, Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia and China established prolonged periods of domestic peace and stability for their national progress and economic prosperity. Vietnam, Indonesia, Bangladesh, India, Brazil, and Senegal are recent examples of successful development stories due to relative levels of domestic peace and political stability. Most nations in Africa, the Middle East and Latin America continue to struggle and suffer from anarchy and disorder in their societies.\nOn the other hand, anarchy destroys nations, as evidenced by history. It destroys national vitality and core ethos, which are the sources of national progress and prosperity. Even in the current world, many societies and nations have been suffering from poverty, underdevelopment, and social backwardness due to chronic political and social unrest caused by anarchy and terrorism. From Mali to Sudan, African countries are fragmented on the lines of insurgent groups, extremist outfits and rebellious entities supported by external forces. The continuing presence of United Nations peacekeeping missions in several African nations demonstrates the consequences of anarchy, destruction and hatred in societies. Iraq, Libya and Syria are glaring examples of external intervention and subsequent political and social disorder, political anarchy and cultural decay in these societies.\nADVERTISEMENT\nPeople in the West and a few non-Western nations understand that anarchy means the destruction of their societies, economies and cultures. Political movements and social discontentment do not lead to anarchy in the developed world for their liberal and knowledge-based understanding of phenomena. Some countries like France recently witnessed massive political and social unrest and protests. But it never crossed the limit to destroy the French economy and sources of life and livelihoods.\nRELATED\nbusiness\nMalaysia forced-labour case haunts Dyson\nthailand\nThailand detains 70 illegal migrants believed to be Rohingya from Myanmar\nBangladesh has recently witnessed an upsurge of mindless violence and anarchy, resulting in the destruction of treasured public properties, insecurity of common people, collapse of economic activities and social breakdown. The peaceful demonstration of anti-discrimination (Quota-Reform Movement) turned violent at some point in time through the penetration of terrorist and anarchic forces. It is widely reported in the media that opposition political forces immediately seized the opportunity and extended their support to the movement in the first place. Later on, they engaged in arson, demolition, and looting to create havoc in the nation.\nThe main opposition political party on the street, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), reportedly expressed its support and stated its goal: the downfall of the Sheikh Hasina government with immediate effect. The goal of ousting an elected government in the midst of a student movement is a mockery at its highest level.\nRejecting a verdict of the High Court Division of Bangladesh, students demanded that the government reinstate the notice of dismantling or reforming the quota system in government jobs in Bangladesh. This demand is very specific and related to the government's policy. When the government took time, the student community became impatient and emotional about it.\nAs days passed, it created enormous sympathy for young students of all ages, from high school to university. Academic institutions, particularly the University of Dhaka, became the epicentre of the movement, as has always happened in the history of Bangladesh. Eventually, a non-violent movement turned into a violent one in one fateful day, giving an ideal chance for anti-government political forces to merge into the movement. Exploiting the wrath of the students and public sentiment, these forces have unleashed a reign of terror that Bangladesh has never witnessed since its birth on 16 Dec 1971.\nThe reign of terror in the name of protests has caused irreparable damage to the nation on every front -- economic, societal, political and cultural. Specifically, the destruction caused to roads, highways, expressways, metro rail, railways, national public offices, factories, industrial locations and academic installations is unimaginable. More than 800 prisoners were forcibly freed from a district jail, including nine convicted extremists. This has been known to historians as the new level of anarchy in Bangladesh. The economic cost of the destruction is going to be unprecedented in terms of disruptions of production, services, and businesses. A rough estimate of direct GDP lost is no less than US$1.3 billion (46 billion baht) daily since July 18, when everything came to a standstill due to this reign of terror.\nThe key question is, who has benefited from this anarchy?\nBangladesh has more than 170 million population. The country has been thriving over the past decade and astonishingly has already surpassed India by per capita income and Pakistan by per capita income and gross domestic product (GDP). The magnitude of destruction caused by the recent spree of anarchy and violence clearly shows that it is primarily a reflection of the vengeance of the anti-Liberation forces who were defeated in 1971. Activists of Jamaat-e-Islam and Islami Chatra Shibir, BNP and scores of radical political outfits led the country-wide anarchy to oust the Sheikh Hasina government through the destruction of the economy of the country.\nSecond, the protesters, who were finally cornered and subdued due to the government's zero-tolerance policy, took the opportunity to demonstrate their capacity to cause massive damage to the people and economy.\nThird, international actors who do not like the balanced and independent foreign policy of Bangladesh may support the anarchic forces to create pressure on the government. There is a clear marriage of interests of local and external players to foment public anger and lead to destruction as evidence of incapacity and failure of the government to run the state. Fourth, apart from dislodging the government, there may be actors beyond the border to slow, if not halt, the growth of Bangladesh's economy.\nRecently, Bangladesh has emerged as an assertive nation in the global South, riding on its economic success, which helped the nation become a \"developing country\" and a \"middle-income\" economy. Bangladesh's progress may cause worries to those countries for fear of losing influence in the world.\nFifth, domestic anarchic outfits may have received support from their global networks. These external terrorist and violent networks will benefit from weakening the liberal fabric of Bangladeshi society.\nWho are the sufferers? The ultimate sufferers are the common people and the subaltern.\nA government may face challenges of governance or even lose power but it does not help the nation. The perpetrators wanted to inflict long-term damage on the economy so that Bangladesh would never flourish. Eventually, it will embrace the fate of Pakistan to the great delight of the anti-liberation and anti-people anarchic political forces. They have effectively capitalised on the student movement to achieve their political motives, where students have been pawns knowingly or unknowingly. The student community must understand this and think out of the box for the greater interests of the people and nation.\nSultan Mahmud, PhD, is Professor, Department of Political Science, University of Rajshahi, Bangladesh.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat hotel facilities are most important to you when choosing accommodation?\nSwimming pool\nFitness center\nRestaurants and bars\nMassage and spa\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nBangladesh\nDo you like the content of this article?\n6\n16\nCOMMENT\n(2)",

(Photo: Bloomberg)\nHu Xijin\n, the former editor-in-chief of China\u2019s state-backed\nGlobal Times\n, has been banned from posting on social media after he wrote controversial comments about the economy, according to a person familiar with the matter.\nThe prominent influencer\u2019s accounts \u2014 including on the microblogging site Weibo where he has nearly 25 million followers \u2014 have been suspended, said the person, who asked not to be identified discussing private matters. The person did not specify the length of the ban.\nHu has become well-known in the West in recent years for his prolific and often combative English-language commentaries about current events. They are generally assumed to be accurate reflections of the official Communist Party view.\nADVERTISEMENT\nHu last posted on Saturday, marking an unusual silence for a prolific voice who was used to posting several times a day on Weibo.\nRELATED\nbusiness\nChinese censors target economic \u2018doomsayers\u2019\nopinion\nA last look back at Asia this year\nThe blackout was triggered by Hu\u2019s assessment that a twice-a-decade conclave President Xi Jinping presided over last month signalled a \u201chistoric\u201d shift in putting public and private enterprises on an equal footing, the source said.\nThe ban is a signal that authorities want to limit public discussions about the issue, the person added.\nThe ruling Communist Party has shrunk the space for open economic debate as policymakers grapple with a slowdown caused by a deepening property slump. Authorities have also pressed analysts to avoid writing about sensitive terms such as \u201cdeflation\u201d, while official data deemed unflattering to the outlook has increasingly been withheld.\nSilencing someone with a three-decade career in state media and who is still an \u201cinsider to China\u2019s propaganda priorities\u201d sends a stark message, said Wen-Ti Sung, a political scientist with the Taiwan Studies programme at Australian National University.\n\u201cThat even Hu can run afoul of the red lines goes to show how hard it is to know where the red line is for anyone engaging in public political discourse in China today,\u201d he added.\nBloomberg News could not reach Hu for comment, but the former titan of state media did not deny his accounts had been blocked when approached by\nSing Tao\nnewspaper, which first reported that his account went silent.\n\u201cI personally don\u2019t want to say anything. You can just read what\u2019s online. Please understand,\u201d he told the Hong Kong-based outlet this week.\nDays after China\u2019s top leaders wrapped up the Third Plenum on long-term reforms, Hu flagged the meeting\u2019s resolution had skipped an important slogan pledging to keep \u201cpublic ownership as the mainstay\u201d of the economy.\nThat phrase featured in the readout of a similar gathering in 2013 and had reverberated through important Communist Party documents since. Its absence signalled the private sector should now hold equal weight with state-owned companies, Hu claimed.\n\u201cThe changes are undoubtedly historic,\u201d Hu wrote in the now-deleted post on Weibo on July 22. \u201cNon-public ownership and public ownership have become truly equal in their status.\u201d\nThat shift in language suggested private firms would no longer be disadvantaged compared with state-owned companies in areas such as project bidding and getting bank loans, he added.\nPutting private and public firms on equal footing is an uncomfortable assertion for China\u2019s socialist economy. State-owned firms receive significant support, and they play a key role in maintaining economic stability and fulfilling state objectives.\nOnline backlash\nHu\u2019s comments sparked an immediate backlash. Some users accused him of intentionally misleading the public with his own interpretation of a party document, pointing out the missing phrase is baked into China\u2019s constitution.\nHu retired from\nGlobal Times\nin late 2021 but has remained active on social media platforms as an opinion influencer. Once notorious as a combative force, Hu in 2022 tweeted that China\u2019s military should take down then US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s plane if she was escorted by US fighter jets as she prepared to arrive in Taipei \u2014 the self-ruled island Beijing claims as its own.\nBut as the Chinese government tightened online discussions in recent years, Hu has increasingly come under attack for being too liberal. When nationalist netizens called for a boycott of Nongfu Spring products over the perceived Japanese influence on its packaging, Hu urged tolerance towards private entrepreneurs and emphasised their contributions to China\u2019s economy.\nHu has acknowledged the power of his comments on social media. In an interview with Bloomberg News in 2019, he vowed to be \u201cmore cautious\u201d after noting his posts could move markets.\n\u201cIf my tweets create collateral damage and cause losses for US investors, that\u2019s not what I want,\u201d he said back then. \u201cMy biggest hope is to express things more freely.\u201d\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat hotel facilities are most important to you when choosing accommodation?\nSwimming pool\nFitness center\nRestaurants and bars\nMassage and spa\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nHu Xijin\nGlobal Times\nChina\nCensorship\nDo you like the content of this article?\n10\n57\nCOMMENT\n(9)",

But a rising tide of disinformation is undermining the effectiveness of these investments.\nFor example, a massive increase in financing for climate adaptation is urgently needed, but the impact of calls for increased investment would likely be limited if disinformation campaigns persuade people that global warming doesn't exist or is not worth addressing. As Covid-19 showed, pandemic responses can be undermined if people fall victim to misleading health advice. And without a free and independent press to hold politicians and policymakers to account, famines become more likely, because increasingly scarce resources such as water and arable land may be poorly managed in the absence of transparent and equitable governance.\nMore worryingly, disinformation threatens not only development but also democracy itself. As news organisations struggle to survive a fast-changing media landscape, abuses of political and corporate power go unchecked. Independent journalism is one of the cheapest and most efficacious bulwarks against authoritarianism. And yet, while autocratic regimes invest billions in disinformation, Western countries are doing little to address the problem.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC) recently published a landmark report underscoring this \"mismatch between rhetoric and resource allocation.\" A detailed mapping study of ODA for media found that donor countries have not allocated enough resources to respond adequately to the dramatic erosion of information integrity worldwide. In fact, it is so effective that autocrats are spending billions of dollars each year to undermine it by influencing domestic and foreign media narratives, as Freedom House's report on China's global media influence shows.\nRELATED\nsports\nIshii's army ready to strike\nthailand\nCommission fears low turnout in polls\nOver the last decade, the percentage of the global population living under autocratic rule has risen from 49% to 70%, disinformation has surged in every country, and the financial threats confronting independent media have become existential. But support for media has remained stagnant, with 38 OECD countries spending a total of around US$500 million per year (18 billion baht) -- or about a third of Russia's estimated propaganda budget. This represents less than 0.2% of total ODA in 2022 (the most recent year for which statistics are available).\nWorse, only a small fraction of this support is directly channelled to independent media organisations in recipient countries. The report finds that less than 10% of ODA for media and the information environment is delivered to journalists, media outlets, and civil society organisations focused on journalism. This represents a mere 0.05% of total ODA between 2016 and 2022.\nFortunately, some donor countries have finally begun to recognise this need. In March, the OECD DAC published a new set of principles for providing relevant and effective support to media and the information environment, which call for increasing financial and other forms of support, and strengthening local leadership and ownership.\nThis suggests that the low levels of spending on independent journalism do not reflect a lack of knowledge or evidence. Rather, donor countries consider this type of support to be politically challenging and difficult to execute -- and rightly so. Investment in independent media can complicate government-to-government relationships.\nIn addition, preserving the editorial independence of media outlets remains essential. While the amount of ODA going directly to media organisations is unacceptably low, it would also be inappropriate for donor countries to increase direct support themselves -- no government should be picking and choosing which news outlets are worthy of support.\nOur organisation, the International Fund for Public Interest Media (which financially supported the OECD DAC study but played no role in data collection or analysis), was created to address these challenges. As a multilateral fund that pools contributions from a large and diverse group of donors, it is designed to channel funding to media outlets quickly and at scale, without compromising editorial independence.\nEqually important are the other global, regional, and local organisations that help strengthen the capacity of independent media, advocate for press freedom, and push for regulatory reform. The International Fund was set up to work in synergy with these entities.\nAll of these initiatives are ready to scale up their support. But they need more resources. They must also work together to make media support a more central part of political discussions related to foreign policy and international development. This can be achieved by amplifying constructive voices and broadening the coalition of actors supporting independent media, particularly by connecting journalism's plight to other high-profile problems such as disinformation and corruption.\nLooking ahead, artificial intelligence will fundamentally alter the information ecosystem, making investment in journalism even more critical. With enough funding, independent news outlets will be able to develop the tools and the capacity to deploy new technologies in the service of the public interest, rather than being left behind -- as they were after the rise of social media. If OECD donor countries increased their support for media from 0.2% to 1% of total ODA -- a relatively small increase, given the scale of the challenge -- more than $2 billion would be available for the sector globally.\nWestern countries have been lamenting the crisis in independent media for over a decade now. But foreign-aid spending on journalism has remained flat over that period. The world has changed drastically in the last 10 years, and a shift in donor strategy is long overdue.\n\u00a92024 Project Syndicate\nNishant Lalwani is Co-Founder and CEO of the International Fund for Public Interest Media.

The internecine war between the military junta, known as the State Administration Council (SAC), and the various ethnic armed organisations (EAOs) continues unabated, with no endgame in sight.\nThe situation has also become increasingly dire, with fighting among the EAOs themselves. Following the Northern Alliance's offensive 1027 late last year. the Tatmadaw, as Myanmar's military is known, has gradually lost control of territory, especially in areas bordering China, Thailand and India. Over the past ten months, the EAOs have been bolstered by military victories through joint and individual offensives.\nAs Vientiane prepares for the Asean Ministerial Meeting (AMM) from July 21-27, the bloc is grappling with the harsh reality of how to approach the Myanmar crisis. As the current Asean chair, Laos strictly adheres to the Five-Point Consensus (5PC) as the guidepost on how the bloc will proceed with Myanmar. However, some Asean members are pushing for more optional approaches towards all stakeholders, intending to jumpstart political dialogue in the future.\nADVERTISEMENT\nLaos has scheduled an informal consultative meeting between the current, past, and future rotating chairs on July 24 to review the implementation of 5PC. Thailand first proposed it after the coup in 2021, but no consensus was reached back then. Early this year, the troika idea was revived following the implementation of the Thai-Myanmar humanitarian assistance plan.\nHowever, the resignation of former deputy prime minister and foreign minister, Parnpree Bahiddha-Nukara in May caused a hiccup in Thailand's efforts to advance the aid plans. As of now, Thailand has yet to name a new chief for the special committee to scrutinise the Myanmar crisis, which used to be headed by Mr Parnpree.\nRELATED\nbusiness\nCasinos a game-changer for Thai tourism, says Agoda\nthailand\nPM to tackle disparity at meets\nThe rotational chairs' meeting is crucial to further maintain the progress under their respective leadership. It will indicate the scope and scale of Indonesia and Malaysia's involvement in the future. Last year, Indonesia held more than 100 meetings with Myanmar's stakeholders. Both countries have been critical of Nay Pyi Taw since the coup. Furthermore, the meeting can decide if they wish to expand the troika formula to troika-plus.\nOn humanitarian assistance, Thailand wants to see the assistance plan extended to include other dialogue partners and UN special agencies, especially those related to food and health security. The new UN special envoy on Myanmar, Julie Bishop, has been travelling throughout Asean to learn firsthand about the situation in Myanmar. During her latest visit to Thailand, she told Foreign Minister Maris Sangiampongsa that she intended to work with all concerned parties and Asean while keeping a low profile and avoiding publicity. She reiterated that Thailand is a significant player in finding solutions to the situation in Myanmar.\nAhead of the upcoming AMM, Alounkeo Kittikhoun, the current Asean special envoy, has been trying to extract further concessions from the SAC, such as the release of additional political prisoners, stopping violence against civilians, and expanding humanitarian assistance programmes. Without \"substantive progress\" in these areas, it will be difficult for the Asean chair to invite a senior Myanmar official to attend the bloc's annual conferences. In January, Laos invited an acting permanent secretary for foreign affairs to attend the retreat. Myanmar has already been stripped of the chairmanship in 2026, which will be assumed by the Philippines.\nMeanwhile, some Asean members have increased their contacts and communications with the overseas representatives of the National Unity Government (NUG), the civilian government formed in opposition to the military coup, to heap pressure on the SAC. However, they are not ready to recognise the NUG, although some have threatened to do so.\nLooking forward, the 5PC remains the effective framework to which all concerned parties must adhere, including the bloc's four powerful dialogue partners--the US, China, India, and Russia. Lately, these great powers have intensified their engagement with various stakeholders, keeping their agendas in mind.\nRecently, US Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, Daniel Kritenbrink, held a second meeting in Hanoi with senior Myanmar officials, signalling Washington's willingness to engage the SAC. The first meeting, in February, took place in an airport hotel in Bangkok with junior officials from Myanmar. During the brief democratic period from 2011-2021, Washington normalised ties with Myanmar after a series of concessions from Nay Pyi Taw. The meetings with the SAC showed Washington's eagerness to leverage its role with other great regional players.\nWith their common borders, China and India have long been engaging with the SAC and EAOs straddling their adjacent territories. At the end of June, China invited former Myanmar's president Thein Sein to attend the 70th anniversary of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. His visit was followed by the junta's Commander-in-chief, Gen Soe Win, who was in Qingdao, Shandong province, to participate in a sustainable development forum. These high-level visits came amid intensified fighting in Myanmar's Northeastern region. In the future, these two powerful figures could be on invitation lists of key Asean members.\nLast week, at the Bimstec foreign minister (Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation) retreat in New Delhi, Indian Foreign Minister S Jaishankar met with his Myanmar's counterpart, U Than Swe, reiterating India's support for Myanmar to return to democracy in Myanmar. India has been a strong supporter of track 1.5 meetings, initiated by Bangkok, to address other key issues of illegal narcotics, arms trade and displaced persons for the countries bordering Myanmar. On the sidelines of the retreat, foreign ministers from Thailand, India and Myanmar also held a meeting to discuss their mutual concerns.\nOf late, Asean has closely watched Russia's role in Myanmar's conflict. Lest we forget, Moscow has not meaningfully endorsed the 5PC. Russia remains an outlier. With ongoing international isolation imposed after the invasion of Ukraine, Russia is strengthening ties with the developing countries in the Global South, especially Southeast Asia.\nThese powerful dialogue partners can also pressure the SAC to implement the 5PC fully. At this crucial juncture, some of their activities and schemes, including the so-called \"non-lethal\" assistance, could directly impact the Asean centrality and the current peace efforts. It is imperative that Asean collaborate and work on the same page to prevent the SAC from playing one power against the other.\nWith the geopolitical shifts, the SAC must recognise that now is the time to act positively to the Lao chair's suggestions, as the fatigue level within Asean is kicking in. Time is running out for the SAC as its economy is worsening by the hour, and public outrage against the junta's atrocities is growing by the day.\nFor Asean, the stakes are high. If the crisis is not contained and resolved, outside players can assert their influence and turn the situation into a proxy war, as has happened in other parts of the world. The region must avoid this predicament at all costs.\nKavi Chongkittavorn\nA veteran journalist on regional affairs\nKavi Chongkittavorn is a veteran journalist on regional affairs\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWould you consider buying a house in a gated community or as a standalone property?\nGated community\nStandalone house\nEither, depending on location and price\nNo preference\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nMyanmar\nBurma\nFight\nCivil war\nDo you like the content of this article?\n5\n36\nCOMMENT\n(13)",

The brokerage picks Bangkok Expressway and Metro (BEM), Global Power Synergy (GPSC), Airports of Thailand (AOT), AP Thailand (AP), Berli Jucker (BJC), Plan B Media (PLANB) and Carabao Group (CBG).\nASPS said risk factors to monitor during the final three months of 2024 include the US election on Nov 5, interest rate cuts by the Fed and other central banks, the consequences of China's large-scale economic stimulus, and tensions in the Middle East, which are likely to intensify and become more widespread.\nInvestors should also monitor the recession risk for the US economy, or whether a soft landing is more likely, said Mr Therdsak.\nIf Republican candidate Donald Trump win the US presidential election, it will raise concerns about a worsening trade war, dampening prospects for the Chinese stock market in the near future, he said.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nIf you were to buy real estate in Thailand outside of Bangkok, which area would be your top choice?\nChiang Mai\nPhuket\nPattaya\nKhao Yai\nKoh Samui\nHua Hin\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nStock exchange\nInvestment\nSecurities\nTarget\nIndex\nDo you like the content of this article?\n4\n9\nCOMMENT\n(2)",

The Fed will not rush, he said, as new data shows continued growth in the economy and spending.\nRichmond Fed president Tom Barkin believes it may take longer than expected to bring US inflation back to the 2% target, a view that supports smaller rate cuts going forward.\nThe September ISM services index in the US rose to 54.9, higher than the consensus forecast of 51.7 and the highest since February 2023, reinforcing that market view that the US economy will achieve a soft landing, a positive case for equities.\nUS job openings in August increased to 8.04 million, higher than expected. The September manufacturing PMI fell to 47.3, the third month of contraction.\nThe yen plunged on Thursday after Japan's new Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said conditions were not right for another interest rate increase by the Bank of Japan.

Given the widespread consensus both at home and abroad that Thailand has fallen behind its peers over the past two decades, the imperative of regaining its international standing is undisputed. But doing so under what the foreign minister has outlined as a \"neutral stance\" under \"non-alignment\" among the great powers is moot and misguided. What Thai foreign policy needs is multi-alignments and omni-directionality under a new rudder.\nFirst, Mr Maris should be credited for his public accessibility and accountability, unlike his predecessor under the military-backed regime of Gen Prayut Chan-o-cha. The foreign minister, a career diplomat who remains in the same post under the Paetongtarn government after the preceding Srettha Thavisin administration was removed by the Constitutional Court last month, has already held several rounds of regular \"meet the press\" sessions. Widely known as a loyalist of Thaksin Shinawatra, the powerbroker and founder of the ruling Pheu Thai Party and father of the prime minister, Mr Maris will need to demonstrate a sufficient degree of autonomy in policymaking and diplomacy to come into his own and to cultivate international stature and regional acceptance to make his way.\nIt has been difficult for Thailand to move on the global stage in any forward direction when its elected government is constantly being sabotaged. The election results in May 2023 were subverted so that the biggest winner, the Move Forward Party, and its up-to-date policy platform and ambition for Thailand's \"middle power\" status were upended. Mr Srettha's one year in office was a diplomatic waste, having made progress on Myanmar policy and foreign policy forays in multiple directions yet succumbing to unelected forces.\nADVERTISEMENT\nMs Paetongtarn now faces similar charges from similar saboteurs who keep filing court petitions to keep the government off balance. Thailand's structural constraints are characterised by the systemic weakening of the executive branch and division and co-option of the legislature, buttressed by entrenched elites who don't necessarily like what is happening but hold too many vested interests to change it. These structural impediments have held Thailand back for two decades in all domains, from political reform and economic upgrading to educational progress and social reconciliation.\nRELATED\nbusiness\nIEAT eager to unveil Smart Park estate\nthailand\nB300bn allocated for six double-track railway projects\nThai foreign policy is thus challenged by these structural issues. What Mr Maris has delineated as \"diplomacy for the people\" and \"proactive economic diplomacy\" harks back two decades when Mr Thaksin was still in power before being overthrown by a military coup in 2006. Back then, it was known as \"people-centred diplomacy\", while commercial policy by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was operationalised under the \"CEO ambassador\" concept. Although many countries have long practised economic diplomacy and ran trade and investment policies out of their embassies, Thailand's first encounter mixing traditional diplomacy with trade was disastrous. Back then, senior diplomats resented being commercial agents as they prided themselves as representatives of their sovereign. Mr Thaksin was partly overthrown for trying to modernise Thai diplomacy.\nNow, diplomacy that people can relate to and the foreign policy pursuit of economic interests are back. They should be welcomed, but putting words into action and ideas into practice will be the real test. For example, the free-trade negotiations under the Thai-European Union Comprehensive Partnership and Cooperation Agreement (PCA) are still unfinished after a long pause following another military coup in 2014. This Thai-EU free-trade agreement can usher in the myriad economic and structural reforms Thailand sorely needs. But the domestic bargaining and negotiating trade-offs with big Thai firms have yet to occur.\nA similar but smaller and, therefore, more manageable trade deal between Thailand and the European Free Trade Association also remains incomplete despite entering the final stages. The Thai-EFTA free-trade deal yields benefits beyond trade. It can provide economic policy momentum and signify that Thailand is back in the global economic arena. Those who view FTAs as foreign meddling and unequal treaties should know that the world is going in this direction, either bilateral, regional (eg Asean Economic Community) or plurilateral (like the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership and Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership). Vietnam, for instance, has had a comparable free-trade agreement with the EU since 2019, and Vietnam and Malaysia are members of both the CPTPP and RCEP.\nIf Mr Maris can weave Thai \"soft power\" into proactive economic diplomacy, it would be even better. His highlighting of the lower ends of diplomacy, such as cross-border drug and human trafficking, water management, scam call centres, PM2.5 pollution, and transnational crimes, are steps in the right direction. Yet what will matter most are the higher priorities on Thailand's foreign policy agenda.\nThe foreign minister was spot-on to stress Myanmar as Thailand's top foreign and security policy concern. Like the previous Srettha government, Mr Maris wants Thailand to play a leading role in resolving Myanmar's civil war and taking part in what happens next in the warn-torn neighbour next door. Again, operationalising this aim is key. Mr Maris would do well to pick up where his predecessor, former Foreign Minister Parnpree Bahiddha-nukara, left off. Mr Parnpree was able to engage with all sides, opened up humanitarian assistance channels, and crucially gained the trust of the resistance coalition that is winning the civil war against the military junta that seized power in February 2021. What Mr Maris must avoid are the pro-junta efforts put up by his other predecessor, former Foreign Minister Don Pramudwinai.\nWhat will matter most is the high politics of international diplomacy and Thailand's broad geostrategic approach. For Thailand, a United States treaty ally with intimate ties to China, non-alignment is na\u00efve, while neutrality sounds nice but is misplaced. In the intensifying torrents of geostrategic competition and conflict the world over, Thailand needs to multi-align with the major powers and go omnidirectional globally.\nHarnessing close and unrivalled relations with the major powers is the cornerstone of Thailand's moving multi-alignment, and it would be all the better if this country could again harbour a \"middle power\" aspiration. The last time Thailand was seen as a potential middle power was 20 years ago. It's time to be bold with some self-belief again despite structural agents of tradition and backwardness who want to hold the country back.\nThitinan Pongsudhirak\nSenior fellow of the Institute of Security and International Studies at Chulalongkorn University\nA professor and senior fellow of the Institute of Security and International Studies at Chulalongkorn University\u2019s Faculty of Political Science, he earned a PhD from the London School of Economics with a top dissertation prize in 2002.

The UK is a crucial trading partner for Thailand.\nADVERTISEMENT\nLast year, bilateral trade reached US$6.7 billion, the highest tally in five years.\nThe Joint Economic and Trade Committee (Jetco), established after Brexit, provides a formal platform for high-level economic dialogue between the two countries.\nRELATED\nsports\nIshii's army ready to strike\nthailand\nMaris to visit Myanmar next week\nThrough Jetco, the two countries developed the Thailand-UK Strategic Partnership Roadmap, which provides a clear framework for expanding cooperation across a wide range of sectors and reflects shared commitment to deepening strategic ties and enhancing cooperation for mutual benefit.\nRecently the two countries signed an enhanced trade partnership (ETP) covering more than 20 sectors including digital trade, agriculture, sustainability and technology.\nThe work plan attached to the ETP outlines joint activities that both sides will conduct across these sectors over the next two years.\nThe pact can unlock new avenues for growth in areas such as clean energy, sustainable development and the digital economy.\nThe ETP also commits both sides to identifying opportunities that could be delivered through a future UK-Thailand FTA.\nSuch an agreement would not only strengthen economic ties, but also provide businesses in both countries with access to new opportunities, driving long-term prosperity for both economies.\nThe Thai government remains committed to promoting trade, investment and diplomacy, said Mr Pichai, adding the nation plans to accelerate the conclusion of FTAs with key partners.\nThailand has 15 FTAs with 19 countries, including Asean members, China, Japan and Australia. Thailand is negotiating trade agreements with the EU, the European Free Trade Association and South Korea.\nThe Thai government's economic vision -- Ignite Thailand -- aims to position the country as a global hub for tourism, medical services, agriculture and innovation.\nWith the UK leading in sectors such as innovation, technology and sustainable growth, the Commerce Ministry is confident there are opportunities for the two countries to collaborate even more closely.\nThailand invited British investors to consider the Eastern Economic Corridor and the Land Bridge project to enhance their trade partnership.\nAs part of the business mission to the UK on Sept 19-23, the Commerce Ministry hosted the Ignite Thailand Festival in Selfridges department store in London, promoting Thai food, fashion and soft power in the UK. The festival aligns with the \"Think Thailand, Next Level\" campaign, which emphasises Thailand's leadership in lifestyle products, food and fashion.\nThe goal is to solidify Thailand's reputation as a trusted trade partner and a hub of innovation and high-quality products. In addition, Thai food was displayed on digital billboards in Piccadilly Circus, a popular London tourist attraction.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat type of building do you prefer for a condominium?\nHigh-rise (more than 10 floors)\nMid-rise (5-10 floors)\nLow-rise (less than 5 floors)\nNo preference\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nThailand\nBusiness\nCommerce Minister\nBritish\nInvest\nFree trade agreement\nFTA\n\u0e18\u0e38\u0e23\u0e01\u0e34\u0e08\n\u0e01\u0e23\u0e30\u0e17\u0e23\u0e27\u0e07\u0e1e\u0e32\u0e13\u0e34\u0e0a\u0e22\u0e4c\n\u0e19\u0e31\u0e01\u0e18\u0e38\u0e23\u0e01\u0e34\u0e08\n\u0e2d\u0e31\u0e07\u0e01\u0e24\u0e29\n\u0e25\u0e07\u0e17\u0e38\u0e19\n\u0e01\u0e32\u0e23\u0e04\u0e49\u0e32\u0e40\u0e2a\u0e23\u0e35\nDo you like the content of this article?\n4\n8\nCOMMENT",

Each strand and stitch reflects the inspiration from nature, local ways of life and diverse ethnic cultures,\" Ms Chotiros said.\n\"This motivates me to use my knowledge in marketing to commercialise the work of these artisans to improve communities' livelihoods and income in a sustainable way, while also preserving their ethnic identity.\"\nShe said her passion for handwoven textiles produced by local weavers led to the establishment of Welcome to Chiang Rai in December 2023.\nThe Community Development Department later introduced the company to 32 entrepreneurs in Chiang Rai keen on using silk and Tai Lue textiles to create a variety of products to decorate shirts, jeans, blazers, hats, scarves and crochet tote bags.\nEXPERIENCE COUNTS\n\"The people who make products for us include both elderly and disabled people aged between 50-75, for whom embroidery has long been part of their everyday lives. The company wants to play a role in helping to create jobs and generate sustainable income for the community,\" said Ms Chotiros.\n\"Instead of producing large items of clothing, which is time-consuming, expensive, and can only be worn only during festivals, we opt to produce smaller pieces that are timeless or can be worn in a variety of settings.\n\"The influx of Chinese products into Thailand has not had a significant impact on the company as our products are handmade and unique, whereas mass-produced items from China are manufactured in factories.\"\nUnesco designated Chiang Rai a \"Creative City of Design\" in 2023.\nKEEPING THE SKILLS ALIVE\nThe company teamed up with Chiang Rai Vocational College to develop a curriculum for textile design featuring an introduction to textiles, yarns, textile materials, fabric designs and advanced drawing.\nVocational students have the opportunity to learn about these subjects and related skills, while working with 32 entrepreneurs in Chiang Rai, with the first cohort scheduled for next month.\nThe programme will provide opportunities for students to sell their craft items, while preparing them for a wide range of careers in the textile and fashion industry, she said.\nMs Chotiros said the company's products are available for sale at Jungceylon in Phuket and Emsphere in Bangkok, with negotiations are ongoing for placement at King Power outlets.\nWelcome to Chiang Rai plans to expand its sales channel to Central Chiang Mai and Central Pattaya, with new stores planned in Yangon, Myanmar and Bodh Gaya, India by year-end, she said.\n\"Instead of promoting the sale of an entire work as a masterpiece, which is less affordable and likely worn in limited circumstances, the company proposes the government elevate craft fabrics by producing small pieces for use as decoration for suits and bags. These could be worn in a variety of settings and exported to other markets, rather than limited to the main markets such as Japan and Europe,\" said Ms Chotiros.\nThe local wisdom and creativity of these cultural assets should be leveraged to increase economic value that promotes the country's soft power, she said.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat type of accommodation do you usually prefer when traveling in Thailand?\nLuxury hotels (5-star)\nMid-range hotels (3-4 star)\nHostels and guesthouses\nPrivate rentals (Airbnb or villas)\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nWelcome to Chiang Rai Co Ltd\nChotiros Thatthaisong\nDo you like the content of this article?\n13\n3\nCOMMENT\n(3)",

The NIA aims to have three unicorn startups within three years.\nADVERTISEMENT\n\"The NIA will focus on driving growth of existing startups through creating demand in the domestic market with government procurement and bringing the startups to the global market to make them attract investment from Southeast Asian regional players,\" said NIA executive director Krithpaka Boonfueng.\nIn fiscal year 2025, the NIA is expected to receive 70 million baht for its \"recoverable grant\" under its corporate co-funding scheme, and around 100 million baht for promoting soft power innovation.\nRELATED\nbusiness\nInnovation agency to finance startups\nbusiness\nNIA reworks support programme for innovative startups\nNIA's corporate co-funding scheme mainly invests in startups at the seed to pre-series A levels by investing up to 10 million baht. The startups have to eventually return the funds to the NIA within five years. The scheme has nine investors registered with the NIA as partners for co-investment in the startups.\nThe FTI has FTI Innovation One, worth 1 billion baht, which will invest 20-30 million baht per deal in seed to Pre Series A. The latter will have to return the funding within three years.\nThe NIA is collaborating with the BoI, with the latter having debuted in July 2024 a new matching fund worth 1 billion baht per year. It aims to invest in high growth potential startups in 13 targeted industries ranging from 20-50 million baht each.\nThe investment criteria is that the startups have to have had investors in the past injecting funds of at least 15 million baht.\nIn the near future, the NIA will establish a private equity trust with a 1-billion-baht fund.\n\"By collaborating with other funding agencies for seamless matching funds in different stages of business and to avoid redundant investments, this will strengthen local startup capital and increase their competitiveness at the international level,\" said Ms Krithpaka.\nThe NIA also offers acceleration programmes in four areas: food technology, agricultural technology, health technology, and climate tech.\n\"We noticed that successful global startups have multinational executives as chief technology officers and chief executives with a global mindset,\" said Ms Krithpaka.\nMoreover, the NIA has collaborated with the Program Management Unit for Competitiveness and the Swedish embassy to help local startups expand their market in Nordic countries and collaborate with their startups to open markets in Southeast Asia.\nMs Krithpaka added that the NIA also held discussions with Lithuania to collaborate in fintech, including cybersecurity and life science.\nPariwat Wongsamran, NIA's deputy executive director of innovation system, added that the NIA has international partners that are partnering with local startups and opening up the market for these startups.\nThe NIA has partnered with major Japanese cities such as Tokyo, Osaka and Fukuoka, and the Japan External Trade Organization, or Jetro Bangkok. Fukuoka is interested in climate tech.\nIn addition, the NIA has partnered with the Hong Kong Trade Development Council, Hong Kong Science Park and Invest Hong Kong to support local startups on the feasibility test, sandbox, and trial in the market.

(Photo: Varuth Hirunyatheb)\nHindsight is likely to place\nSrettha Thavisin\nin Thai political annals as a prime minister who tried his best but ultimately succumbed to\nforces way beyond his control\n. While his nearly 12-month tenure in office came up short on policy deliverables, it nevertheless reset Thailand's foreign policy projection on Myanmar amid more omnidirectional relations with the major powers.\nTo be sure, Mr Srettha's domestic policy agenda was stymied and obstructed from the outset. The lesson for his successor, Prime Minster Paetongtarn Shinawatra, is that policy progress depends less on merit and more on the bargaining and alignment of interests with forces behind the scenes.\nTo be sure, Mr Srettha's rise to the premiership was unwitting, a result of his connection with Pheu Thai founder Thaksin Shinawatra and his sister and also former prime minister Yingluck Shinawatra and the military-inspired 2017 constitution, whereby all political parties contesting the 2023 general election had to come up with a slate of up to three candidates for prime minister. Most major parties forwarded just one, but the Pheu Thai Party proposed three in late 2022 because it had faced dissolutions and premiership disqualifications in the past.\nADVERTISEMENT\nMs Paetongtarn and Chaikasem Nitisiri, the party's elderly legal hand, were the other two. When the Move Forward Party won the poll but was kept away from office by constitutional means, Pheu Thai was co-opted in a bargain that brought its founder, Thaksin Shinawatra, back from exile on the same day that Mr Srettha received sufficient votes from the military-appointed Senate to take the helm.\nHeading a coalition government combining Pheu Thai with pro-military parties that had conspired to overthrow Ms Yingluck's government in a military coup in 2014, Mr Srettha's outsider status was his main strength and chief weakness. As an outsider, he was not beholden to vested interests and patronage politics that underpin elections and coalition governments. His billionaire status from family-owned property development was measured in baht rather than dollars. Mr Srettha pitched himself as a successful businessman in a technocratic fashion to help get the Thai economy out of its persistent doldrums.\nRELATED\nbusiness\nIndonesian tycoon eyes theme park, F1 in $16bn project\nthailand\nMinister backs bill for Thailand's 20 million informal workers\nHe made a host of foreign trips to drum up foreign investments and to show that Thailand now had an elected government after years of military-authoritarian rule and that the country was once again open for business. Mr Srettha met with Chinese President Xi Jinping and attended China's Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation in October 2023. But unlike his immediate predecessor, he showed that Thailand was no longer as reliant on Chinese support as in the coup years by visiting myriad other countries. At the main dinner of the Apec summit in San Francisco in November 2023, he was seated next to US President Joe Biden.\nOn Myanmar, Thailand finally corrected its wayward course of supporting the junta in Nay Pyi Taw during Bangkok's previous military-backed regime. Under the Srettha government, former Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Parnpree Bahiddha-nukara made headway and gained the trust of resistance forces by recognising and engaging them directly and by providing humanitarian assistance and overall goodwill.\nIt was a more balanced approach, and Thailand needed to play a leading role in Asean in search of a way forward in Myanmar. Mr Parnpree should now feel vindicated for his decision to quit the government last April after a cabinet reshuffle dropped his dual deputy PM post. Coalition politics and power plays behind the scenes are not worth putting up with in view of what's happened to Mr Srettha.\nA self-proclaimed \"salesman\" for Thailand everywhere he went, Mr Srettha sought investments from big tech in Silicon Valley and infrastructure investors in the Middle East, South Asia, and elsewhere in Asia and Europe.\nIn fact, he seemed desperate to mobilise foreign investment to shore up the Thai economy, whose trend growth had declined by more than half to just 1.5% annually during the previous nine years under military-backed rule. But Mr Srettha really had no chance of succeeding.\nHis domestic policy initiatives, particularly the 10,000-baht digital wallet scheme for each of 50 million Thais to spur consumption and boost growth, faced legal opposition from the beginning. The \"land bridge\" scheme to link the Gulf of Thailand with the Andaman Sea did not gain traction. The \"soft power\" projects to harness Thailand's cultural capital did not gain momentum. The pending free-trade agreements with the European Union and European Free Trade Association are still awaiting a conclusion and were surpassed instead by the Thai FTA with Sri Lanka, which was unsubstantial and not comprehensive in coverage. In turn, Mr Srettha had to grab what he could to deliver economic growth, thereby resorting to visa-free tourism from China and Russia.\nAfter six months in office, Mr Srettha appeared exasperated. While Move Forward was being lined up for dissolution, Mr Srettha faced a petition from an expiring lot of 40 military-appointed senators for a cabinet reshuffle that put in Pichit Chuenban, who was convicted and jailed in 2008 for trying to bribe court officials on behalf of Mr Thaksin and his wife, as a junior minister in violation of the constitution. Mr Pichit, well known in political circles as a trusted legal aid of the Shinawatra family, was a cabinet choice beyond Mr Srettha's control. As an outsider who could work without the baggage of vested interests, Mr Srettha's weakness was that he had no support base within the Pheu Thai Party. The reshuffle, as with the earlier government formation, was not his doing but it eventually became his undoing.\nHe was unceremoniously sacked by the Constitutional Court in a 5-4 verdict. Removing a sitting prime minister with such a narrow margin was astounding. On closer scrutiny, it has also become controversial.\nOne of the five judges in favour of Mr Srettha's disqualification, Udom Sitthiwirattham, publicly stated two weeks ago that Move Forward Party's leaders should be grateful for his dissolution decision because its successor Prachachon (People's) Party has received tens of million baht in public donations in a matter of days. To the extent that this remark showed undue contempt and prejudice towards the Move Forward Party, Mr Srettha should take comfort in the judgement on his role as premier.\nIn the end, what happened to Mr Srettha was somewhat analogous to the fate of Samak Sundaravej, a veteran politician who became prime minister in 2008 by leading Pheu Thai's earlier banner under the Palang Prachachon (People's Power) Party as a Thaksin nominee. With ultra-right-wing credentials, Samak thought he could help bridge the gap between the conservative establishment and the Thaksin camp. Yet much of his premiership coincided with rabid yellow-shirt protests that eventually laid the ground for the Constitutional Court to disqualify him for hosting a cooking show on TV and receiving a token honorarium for it.\nThe name of the game for the establishment is to divide and rule, use and expend, as situations and circumstances require. Put this way, Mr Srettha's demise at this time in this fashion is probably better than later in worse ways.\nThitinan Pongsudhirak, PhD, is professor at the Faculty of Political Science and a senior fellow at its Institute of Security and International Studies.\nThitinan Pongsudhirak\nSenior fellow of the Institute of Security and International Studies at Chulalongkorn University\nA professor and senior fellow of the Institute of Security and International Studies at Chulalongkorn University\u2019s Faculty of Political Science, he earned a PhD from the London School of Economics with a top dissertation prize in 2002.

If this can be brought above ground, the GDP could increase by 50%, particularly by legalising online gambling, where Thais currently lose 170 billion baht annually.\nIndustrial restructuring:\nBy reducing electricity costs and promoting green energy, Thailand could become a safe haven for industries exporting to various regions like United States, China, Europe, and others, as Thailand faces no significant geopolitical issues.\nEntertainment complexes:\nThis involves a significant investment of hundreds of billions of baht and could include casinos, occupying no more than 10% of the area.\nLand sales to foreigners:\nThais would be able to sell land to foreigners, but the title deed must be transferred to the Treasury Department, which would then lease the land to the foreign buyer for 99 years.\n20 Baht electric train fare:\nThis could be achieved by government buying back private electric train projects, with the government setting ticket prices and introducing congestion charges from passenger car users to subsidise public transportation.\nAgricultural reform:\nUtilising R&amp;D to add value to agricultural products, such as producing high-fiber, low-carbohydrate rice.\nLand Reclamation:\nReclaiming land in areas like Bang Khun Thian and Pak Nam to create new green cities, tourist attractions, and flood protection for Bangkok.\nNegotiating maritime overlapping area:\nExpediting negotiations with Cambodia to jointly utilise fossil energy in the sea before the world moves away from fossil fuels.\nFinancial hub:\nTransforming Thailand into a financial hub to attract global banks to establish operations here for international transactions.\nTax restructuring:\nImplementing negative income tax to refund money to low-income earners, while also considering reductions in corporate and personal income taxes.\nEnhancing tourism potential:\nExpanding airports, developing man-made tourist attractions, and amending laws to facilitate private jet travel.\nBureaucratic reform:\nReducing the number of civil servants, curbing ballooning budgets, and increasingly using technology to replace manual processes.\nPromoting Soft Power in All Forms:\nDevelop an ecosystem to support and enhance Muay Thai, Thai cuisine, fashion, and other cultural assets.\nAdopting protectionism:\nTo ensure fair competition in the market, especially against low-quality, cheap imports, and to develop Thai SMEs into smart SMEs producing unique products, as they cannot compete with China's economy of scale.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nIf you were to buy real estate in Thailand outside of Bangkok, which area would be your top choice?\nChiang Mai\nPhuket\nPattaya\nKhao Yai\nKoh Samui\nHua Hin\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nThaksin\nThailand\nPolicy\nDo you like the content of this article?\nCOMMENT\n(34)",

Furthermore, they are strategic partners.\nADVERTISEMENT\nHowever, beneath the flashy surface of their friendship lie unsweetened and missing layers of puffy cream and vanilla.\nOver the past years, Thailand and South Korea have enjoyed a bilateral relationship many envy.\nRELATED\nthailand\nB.Grimm Celebrates Thai-Korean Unity at Sawasdee Seoul Festival\nbusiness\nTalks start over Thai-Korean economic deal\nEvery day, millions of Thai families are glued to their television sets, watching Korean dramas while enjoying Korean-style double-fried chicken wings and drumsticks served with kimchi.\nSeveral million more are listening to K-pop, with hundreds of thousands dreaming of becoming the next Lisa and many undergoing facial makeovers to look like Koreans.\nNo wonder in Thailand, Korean has become a more popular foreign language than Japanese and French. Today, over 46,000 Thais are studying Korean in middle and high schools and universities. This number represents about 30% of the 160,000 people taking up Korean worldwide.\nBut most young people just want to sing along to K-pop songs without seriously considering the educational value of a more in-depth Korean education. The evidence is clear -- only 1,300 Thais are studying in Korea. In contrast, without any fanfare, Vietnam has a total of 46,000 students and rising.\nBut Thais love everything about South Korea, including visiting the country. Thai tourists flock there in large numbers, especially before the Covid-19 pandemic, and until recently, they made up the largest proportion of visitors from Asean.\nHowever, the numbers dropped dramatically this year after news spread of Thai visitors being denied entry since the end of last year. Social media fanned the flames to the point where Thai anger was openly displayed online, blaming Korean immigration for targeting Thai tourists.\nFor the first time, anti-Korean emotions ran high.\nMeanwhile, Lisa's debut as a solo artist and her performances have been headline news, highlighted by all Thai media platforms. This added to the growing tension between the people of the two countries. Some South Korean influencers downplayed Lisa's enthusiastic support from Thai fans.\nAccording to the Korea Times, 145,810 Thais overstayed their visas until May this year. That figure is about 35.1% of the total of 415,230 such foreign residents, far higher than that of other countries, including Vietnam (79,366), China (64,151), the Philippines (13,740), Indonesia (12,172), and Cambodia (10,681).\nThe Korean Ministry of Justice released this information in a bid to counter the narrative that the country's stringent entry requirements, the so-called K-ETA system -- its electronic travel authorisation -- were responsible for a dramatic drop in Thai tourists this year.\nThe Korea Times pointed out that the ministry said immigration rules were not to blame as they apply to all tourists, but Thais felt targeted nonetheless. On social media, hashtags like \"ban Korea travel\" trended.\nForeign Minister Maris Sangiampongsa visited South Korea last week for two days and discussed these sensitive issues with Korean Prime Minister Han Duck-soo and Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul. Both sides agreed to work together to find common solutions, realising that worsening people-to-people exchanges could impact their bilateral relations.\nWhat has complicated the issue was the arrest of Thai workers involved in drug trafficking.\nForeign Minister Maris reiterated the Thai government's commitment to reducing the number of overstayers.\nThe Korean side was requested to continue a voluntary departure programme and increase the number of legal workers under the working holiday, seasonal workers, and employment permit schemes.\nThe Thai overstayers are a mutual challenge because Thai workers want to work despite being illegally in South Korea. They are willing to take the risk of being deported or even swindled by their agents, as South Korean employers pay much higher wages.\nSimilarly, the Korean private sector, particularly in agriculture and SMEs, still desires Thai workers for their productivity.\nIn Seoul, the two sides agreed to set up a joint committee on culture to deal with all aspects related to consular issues, culture, soft power, and people-to-people exchanges.\nThey also agreed on the importance of promoting awareness and understanding of each other.\nThe committee is scheduled to meet in Bangkok in November. Such an urgent deadline reflects the challenge faced by both countries because the overstayers have already damaged their cordial relations and international images.\nUnder the Pheu Thai-led government, Thailand wants to attract more investment and boost bilateral trade with Korea. Last year, Korean investment was US$1.2 billion (42 billion baht), mainly in electronic appliances, steel, and auto parts. Bilateral trade totalled US$14.737 billion, with Thailand suffering a trade deficit of US$2.596 billion.\nIn contrast, Korean investment and trade with Thailand is minimal compared to Vietnam, even though Thailand is the region's second-largest economy. For the record, last year, Korea-Vietnam trade hit US$79.43 billion, while investment from 9,863 projects by over 8,000 companies was worth around US$90 billion.\nDeputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Pichai Chunhavajira and officials from the Board of Investment are scheduled to visit Seoul later this month to promote Korean investment.\nThailand and Korea have great potential for cooperation in all areas, not only in economic, trade, investment, education, digital and green transformation, or workers but also in security and strategic matters.\nHowever, to move ahead and beyond, they need to change their mutual mindsets about each other, especially the Thai bureaucrats, who still have stereotyped thoughts about South Korea and its people.\nPrime Minister Srettha Thavisin is scheduled to visit South Korea. Before the visit, Thai and Korean officials must work together to develop a common vision to become comprehensive strategic partners soon.\nIt is a huge and long overdue opportunity for both countries, who have sacrificed together and have much to celebrate, to move past domestic complacency and strengthen their relationship.\nKavi Chongkittavorn\nA veteran journalist on regional affairs\nKavi Chongkittavorn is a veteran journalist on regional affairs\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat is your budget range for purchasing a condominium?\nUnder 2 million THB\n2 million - 4 million THB\n4 million - 7 million THB\n7 million - 10 million THB\nOver 10 million THB\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nThai-South Korean relationship\nLisa\nBlackpink\nK-pop\nDo you like the content of this article?\n7\n22\nCOMMENT\n(5)",

The Bank of Thailand's Monetary Policy Committee could possibly cut the policy rate by 0.25 percentage points in December.\nADVERTISEMENT\nRecommended Thai stocks are tourism-related and those set to benefit from growing government spending and economic stimulus, such as retail and utilities, she added.\n\"The Thai economy, however, needs to address structural issues. The industrial sector is facing competition from other countries that have higher competitiveness,\" Ms Vannachan said.\nRELATED\nbusiness\nAsian shares rise after Wall Street advances\nbusiness\nUOBAM catches up with US recovery\n\"As the global economy slows down and trade barriers increase, Thailand's industrial sector needs to adjust itself to turn around business, and this process takes time.\"\nMeanwhile, households and the small business sector are burdened with debt, affecting their purchasing power. Financial institutions have begun to feel the impact of increasing non-performing loans, prompting them to impose stricter lending requirements which consequently cause tighter financial conditions for households and SMEs, she noted.\nMs Vannachan said UOBAM believes the US economy is likely to slow down, but not to the point of recession.\n\"If the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates this year, it will help increase liquidity into the capital market,\" she said.\nThe global economy is expected to slow down in a soft-landing manner. Therefore, risk management amid uncertainties is vital. UOBAM thus suggests investors carefully select the assets to invest in and appropriately diversify their risk, she noted.\n\"Investors are recommended to reduce holding cash and overweighting their investment in global corporate debt instruments, particularly investment-grade ones, which are likely to get attractive returns during a downward interest rate cycle,\" she said.\nAt the same time, greater caution must be exercised when investing in Asian stocks, especially in China.\n\"Despite the attractive value, the Chinese market has already absorbed positive factors while the recovery is still facing challenges,\" she said.\nUOBAM's deputy chief marketing officer Kulachat Chandavimol said factors to monitor in the second half include tight monetary policy, inflation, and geopolitical risks, particularly in the US, Europe and the Middle East, all of which would hurt investment sentiment.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat is your budget range for purchasing a condominium?\nEkkamai-Thong Lor\nSathorn-Silom\nChidlom-Siam\nBang Na\nChinatown\nAri\nRiverside\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nDo you like the content of this article?\n2\n2\nCOMMENT\n(1)",

This period marked the dawn of Thailand's golden era. Following this discovery, the Eastern Seaboard Development Project was initiated to develop the eastern coastal region. Foreign investment poured in, enabling the economy to expand at a double-digit rate while raising hopes that Thailand would become Asia's fifth tiger.\nHowever, the dream was shattered by internal political instability and poor economic policy management, culminating in the 1997 financial crisis known as the Tom Yum Kung crisis.\nThe Tom Yum Kung crisis was triggered by excessive lending by financial institutions and the liberalisation of the country's financial market, allowing commercial banks to borrow money from foreign financial institutions to provide loans to businesses.\nADVERTISEMENT\nReviving domestic investment has proven to be a challenge for the government to push the long-stagnant economy out of its low-growth trap.\nINVESTMENT STIMULUS NEEDED\nRELATED\nbusiness\nThai manufacturers brace for impact of Trump tariffs\nbusiness\nThai finance minister says room for rate cut as inflation is low\nPornchai Thiraveja, director-general of the Fiscal Policy Office under the Finance Ministry, said since the 1997-98 financial crisis, the total investment ratio of both the public and private sectors fell below 25% of GDP.\nIn 2023, the total investment value tallied 2.6 trillion baht, nearly the same level as 25 years ago, which was 2.7 trillion baht. In 1996, before the crisis, Thailand's total investment to GDP ratio was as high as 51%.\nPrivate investment against GDP, which reached a peak of 41% in 1995, dropped to 18% in 2023. Public investment to GDP peaked at 13% in 1997 but has ever since steadily declined and stood at 6% in 2023.\nMr Pornchai emphasised the need for Thailand to speed up stimulating investment to drive the economy and address long-standing structural economic issues accumulated over many decades.\nMr Pornchai emphasised the need for Thailand to speed up stimulating investment to drive the economy and address long-standing structural economic issues accumulated over many decades.\nAccording to Mr Pornchai, Thailand's current economic engines include private consumption, which accounts for 59% of GDP, total investment, which makes up 24% of GDP (with private sector investment at 18% and public investment at 6%), public consumption from fiscal budget disbursements at 15% of GDP, and exports and imports.\nExports of goods and services account for 69% of GDP, with goods exports at 58% and services exports at 12%, while imports of goods and services represent 66% of GDP, with goods imports at 54% and services imports at 12%.\n\"It is necessary to shift our investment towards new engines of growth, which include 10 sectors such as agriculture, food and biotechnology, healthcare, and automotive and machinery,\" he said.\n\"According to the Board of Investment, estimated investments in these 10 sectors are projected to reach 465 billion baht in 2023, 579 billion baht in 2024 and 638 billion baht in 2025.\"\nAccording to Mr Pornchai, in the past and up to the present, Thailand has undertaken investments in several megaprojects.\nAn elevated section of the Bang Pa-in-Saraburi-Nakhon Ratchasima Motorway (M6). According to Mr Pornchai, in the past and up to the present, Thailand has undertaken investments in several megaprojects including infrastructure. Photo courtesy of Nakhonratchasima Highway District 2\nSignificant ones have included Suvarnabhumi International Airport, which began construction in 1960 and opened in 2005, the Eastern Seaboard Development Programme in 1982, the electric train projects in Bangkok and surrounding provinces that started construction in 1990 and continue to the present, the Mass Rapid Transit project starting in 1997 and ongoing, the Eastern Economic Corridor (EEC) beginning in 2018 with a total infrastructure investment of 650 billion baht, the integrated entertainment complex project with an investment of about 100 billion baht, and the Land Bridge with an investment of about 1 trillion baht.\nMoreover, the government is initiating future investment projects under the \"Ignite Thailand\" initiative, which includes eight visions:\n1. A tourism hub, aiming to enhance secondary cities, upgrading small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and promoting soft power through tax measures.\n2. A wellness and medical hub which focuses on integrating healthcare with tourism to generate national income and support SMEs.\n3. An agriculture and food hub, aimed at elevating agricultural and food production to make Thailand a food centre.\n4. An aviation hub, enhancing infrastructure to enhance SMEs' capabilities.\n5. A logistics hub, investing in Land Bridge infrastructure to connect two coastlines to boost business opportunities for the country, develop ease of doing business, enhance competitiveness and attract investment.\n6. A future mobility hub, supporting electric vehicle production and creating a conducive ecosystem for rapid growth for the automotive industry.\n7. A digital economy hub, attracting digital industry investment, supporting startups to become unicorns and adjusting conditions and criteria for venture capital in SMEs.\n8. A financial hub, enhancing the financial system and capital market, promoting digital assets to accommodate future financial investments, and developing carbon credit trading alongside environmental preservation.\nMr Pornchai said plans are also afoot to enhance other transportation systems within and outside the country, aiming to spread economic opportunities from major cities to smaller towns.\nThe Transport Ministry plans to expand primary and secondary roads by 2050, increasing the length of the country's motorway tenfold from 250 kilometres to nearly 2,500 km and expanding national highways to four lanes covering 20,000 km at present to 23,000 km, from the north to the south.\nA 51-km section of the M81 motorway, from tambon Wangtaku in Nakhon Pathom's Muang district to tambon Nongkhao in Kanchanaburi's Tha Muang district.

Bangkok and regional electric train routes will increase 2.5 times to cover almost 700 km, and high-speed trains will connect three airports and the border with Laos at Nong Khai.\nFor deep-sea port development, Laem Chabang port will be expanded, and the Land Bridge project will be invested in.\nECONOMIC PROSPECTS\nFinance Minister Pichai Chunhavajira said the economy should not grow below 3.5%, but during the past five years (2019-23), when the country faced a heavy blow from the adverse impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, the economy grew by an average of only 0.4%.\n\"Thailand's economic growth has been low for a long time and is trending downwards,\" he said.\nThis year, the National Economic and Social Development Council projects growth of around 2.4-2.5%. After the 2024 budget took effect in April, Mr Pichai said he believed accelerated government investment disbursements should push the economy close to 3%.\nEconomic growth in 2025 is expected to be around 3%, but with additional government stimulus measures, it could exceed that figure, he said.\nMeanwhile, Kasikorn Research Center (K-Research) views the structural economic issues as the country's industrial sector lagging behind global market demands, urging the government to overhaul the industrial sector significantly.\nThis year, K-Research expects the Manufacturing Production Index (MPI) to contract by 2%, marking the second consecutive year of decline.\nAccording to the research house, industrial production may continue to slow or even contract further, with the MPI potentially shrinking by 2% this year, following a 3.8% decline last year.\nThis year, K-Research expects the MPI to contract by 2%. The primary reason is the significant negative performance of key items within the MPI during the first four months of the year, particularly in the sectors of electronic equipment, automobiles and construction materials.\nAlthough the food sector may still grow, K-Research said it may not be sufficient to offset the decline in other sectors. This results in a bleak outlook for the MPI in the coming period, making the manufacturing sector less of a contributor to the economy this year.\nLast year, industrial production's role in the Thai economy gradually declined to about 25% of GDP, generating 4.5 trillion baht in revenue, down from 27% in 2022 and 30% in 2021. This indicates an urgent need for a significant overhaul of Thailand's industrial sector.\nAccording to K-Research, the lack of investment in enhancing national competitiveness over the past decades has become more apparent, especially compared to Vietnam, which once lagged behind Thailand but now exports more high-tech products than Thailand.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat type of condominium are you most interested in?\nStudio\n1-bedroom\n2-bedroom\n3-bedroom\nPenthouse\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nEconomic\nGrowth\nEconomy\nEngine\nInvestment\nDo you like the content of this article?\n8\n32\nCOMMENT\n(15)",

(Photo: Ken Bohn/San Diego Zoo Safari Park/handout via Reuters)\nHONG KONG: China's only higher education institute to offer giant panda studies is set to enrol its first students this autumn, giving them the opportunity to observe the bears closely at nature reserves, state broadcaster CCTV reported.\nThe \"giant panda college\" is affiliated with China West Normal University in Sichuan, the southwestern province known for its panda reserves and habitats. The institute was established in September by the provincial forestry and grassland administration.\nA total of 50 undergraduate students will study wildlife and nature reserve management at the Giant Panda Institute, which is expected to promote the \"academic, professional and systematic development of giant panda conservation\", according to the CCTV report on Wednesday.\nADVERTISEMENT\nAds powered by\nThe students will gain hands-on experience at the institute and take part in work related to giant panda conservation, breeding and disease prevention in national nature reserves.\nThey are expected to become professionals in wildlife protection and research after four to seven years of study.\nWei Wei, an instructor at the Giant Panda Institute, told CCTV that the institution's professors and instructors included 22 experts from the Institute of Zoology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the China Conservation and Research Centre for the Giant Panda.\nChina has put decades of effort into panda conservation. The total number of wild giant pandas in China has increased from about 1,100 in the 1980s to nearly 1,900 today. The International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List of Threatened Species has downgraded the giant panda from \"endangered\" to \"vulnerable\".\nBeijing frequently sends giant pandas overseas in a soft-power bid to improve ties and win the hearts of people in foreign countries - a practice known as \"panda diplomacy\".\nThe bears are usually loaned to other countries for 10 years as envoys of goodwill and friendship and serve as barometers of relations between China and the host country.\nGiant pandas Yun Chuan and Xin Bao arrived at the San Diego Zoo on June 27, making them the first pandas to travel to the United States from China in more than 20 years. They are on loan to the California zoo and are reportedly adjusting to their new home. They are not quite ready to meet visitors yet, zoo officials said this week.\nChinese internet users launched a social media campaign in February of last year calling for the return of Ya Ya, a female panda sent to the Memphis Zoo two decades ago, after she appeared to be thin and missing clumps of fur in photos. Ya Ya returned to China in April 2023 at the end of a 20-year loan agreement between the zoo and the Chinese Association of Zoological Gardens.\nA bear named Fubao - the first giant panda born in South Korea - was the centre of another controversy when she was transferred to China in April. A South Korean fan club alleged Fubao was being mistreated in China, leading to feuds between social media users in the two countries.\nEarlier this month, Beijing announced plans to give Hong Kong another pair of giant pandas to mark the 27th anniversary of the city's return to Chinese sovereignty. Four other pandas have been sent to Hong Kong to celebrate the anniversary of the city's handover. Two have since died, while two others named Ying Ying and Le Le, are at Ocean Park.\nHong Kong Chief Executive John Lee Ka-chiu expressed \"deepest gratitude\" for the gift from the central government, saying the move \"fully demonstrates its care and support\" for the city.\nThe two new pandas are expected to contribute to Hong Kong's tourism earnings, and their names will be chosen through a competition.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhich app or platform do you usually use to book accommodations?\nBooking.com\nAgoda\nAirbnb\nTrip.com\nTraveloka\nExpedia\nSkyscanner\nDirectly with the accommodation\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nDo you like the content of this article?\n7\n1\nCOMMENT\n(3)",

The government have emphasized the necessity of promoting Thai soft power and creative economy through the 5F approach: food, film, fashion, fighting, and festivals. Varuth Hirunyatheb\nSluggish economy\nChalermchatri Yukol, chairman of the national soft power development subcommittee for TV and film, said the slumping Asian and Thai economies have greatly affected Thai media content production and export markets.\nThe weak economy pressured Thai TV companies, with the market downturn forcing some of them to scale down their size, while others shuttered operations, said Mr Chalermchatri.\nIn May, Voice TV Co Ltd stopped broadcasting and laid off more than 100 employees.\nHowever, the Thai film industry is still in a good mood, both in terms of revenue and quality, in part because of Thailand's expanding presence in the global film industry before the worldwide economy showed signs of slowing, he said.\n\"The Thai TV series business has shrunk significantly, which could pose a huge challenge to the government's policy to promote soft power,\" said Mr Chalermchatri.\nHe said the industry faces lower prices for broadcast distribution rights than other countries.\nBuyers of Thai TV series are mainly from Southeast Asian countries, which might not have high spending power, making the return from overseas markets relatively low, said Mr Chalermchatri.\n\"The revenue from selling the broadcast rights for Thai TV series is roughly US$5,000-25,000 per broadcast episode, which is 10 times less than the licence price of a TV series from South Korea,\" he said.\nCall to end censorship\nPhetthai Vongkumlao, a Thai film producer, director and well-known comedian, said even though Thailand has talented people to create a thriving film industry and experienced local production houses, state censorship means filmmakers cannot provide diverse content to the industry.\n\"If we have more freedom of expression, we can tell many more stories, and the content we produce will reach more people,\" said Mr Chalermchatri.\nLast year, the Culture Ministry revised ministerial regulations under the Film and Video Act of 2008, which were designed to transform the country's film industry by shifting the power to censor from the government to producers.\nThe move is part of an effort to reduce state control over creative content, promoting self-regulation within the film and gaming industries.\nA key feature of the new legislation is a focus on protecting younger audiences, with provisions to ensure content is age-appropriate and responsibly produced.\nThe bill proposes that producers adopt a self-regulated ratings system, making them more accountable to societal standards, particularly regarding content for children and youth.\nOnly movies with content that may affect the monarchy will remain prohibited from being screened in Thailand.\nMr Chalermchatri says Thai TV and film directors need more freedom of expression to tell stories.\nR&amp;D is imperative\nMr Chalermchatri, who is also a TV and film director, said all stakeholders in the Thai film and TV industry should focus on R&amp;D and innovation, study factors that contribute to the success or failure of Thai content, and learn lessons.\nTo pursue overseas market growth, the industry must study market demand, spending power, and regulation and censorship in each country, he said.\n\"Thailand can learn from successful case studies in other countries, such as South Korea. But keep in mind, we cannot replicate the accomplishments of others in Thailand,\" said Mr Chalermchatri.\n\"We must find our own path.\"\nHe identified the four Asian giants in terms of cultural exports as China, India, South Korea and Japan.\n\"As Thailand aims to become another Asian tiger in cultural exports, its competitors include Taiwan, Russia, Australia and Indonesia,\" said Mr Chalermchatri.\nTaiwan has a similar audience size to Thailand as well as talented actors, while its government works quickly, he said.\nMoreover, Vietnam is a rising star in the region as the private sector organised international film festivals to promote the local industry, transforming the power of culture and cinema into economic potential, said Mr Chalermchatri.\nSoft power TV\nThe government previously initiated a \"soft power TV\" scheme by using government-owned channels such as the National Broadcasting Services of Thailand (NBT) to reschedule and present more content related to Thailand's soft power.\nPrime Minister's Office Minister Jiraporn Sindhuprai said the government has looked into many operating models, such as Arirang TV in South Korea, which promotes the country's dynamic image and unique culture to a global audience of 146 million viewers in 108 countries.\nAs for Thailand, TV programmes would feature content related to Thai food, travel and music, said Ms Jiraporn.\n\"More details on programmes will be announced to the media on July 11,\" she said.\nCommenting on the soft power TV initiative, Mr Chalermchatri said the government needs to set effective communication strategies and targets, which will result in a TV programme line-up.\nAs for streaming platforms, he said there is no need to enforce the promotion of Thai content worldwide, as soft power means people have to choose your content.\nCapturing a global audience\nMr Chalermchatri suggested the government help the private sector to promote Thai soft power and the creative economy by promoting locally made films at international film festivals.\nAnother tactic is to develop professional negotiators to facilitate the sale of Thai film titles on the global market, he said.\nThe government should also encourage and promote movie directors and entertainment professionals to have opportunities to participate in world-class film or TV festivals, said Mr Chalermchatri.\nHe urged the government to create support mechanisms for the creative industry, such as offering cash rebates to attract investment from foreign film productions, funding for cultural products with potential that are both old and new, and creating a space to promote and advertise cultural products to sustainably support the expansion of soft power.\nThe country's creative industries are innovative and gaining in popularity, with the potential to become a growth engine accelerating Thailand's global standing, said Mr Chalermchatri.\nThe government must adopt a strategic and coordinated approach targeting interventions that increase the supply and sustainability of creative local talent, encourage demand for and development of local intellectual property, and foster a more efficient and robust creative ecosystem, he said.\n\"Thailand's educational system, businesses, government and individual creators alike should work together on the promotion of soft power industries,\" said Mr Chalermchatri.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWould you consider buying a house in a gated community or as a standalone property?\nGated community\nStandalone house\nEither, depending on location and price\nNo preference\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nCreative\nIndustry\nSoft\nPower\nSoft power\nDo you like the content of this article?\n1\n49\nCOMMENT\n(9)",

The budget aims to help the economy grow to its full potential, said Mr Srettha.\u2009Chanat Katanyu\nThai politics is nearing a turning point, as next month the political fate of Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin and the leader of the opposition Move Forward Party (MFP) are scheduled to have their cases decided by the Constitutional Court.\nThere is uncertainty about the rulings, slated for July 3 for the dissolution case against the MFP and July 10 for Mr Srettha's case, with the business sector concerned about the effect on the Thai economy if the current administration is disrupted.\nMr Srettha is struggling to defend himself in an ethics probe brought against him in the Constitutional Court, following his controversial appointment of Pichit Chuenban as PM's Office Minister in the last cabinet reshuffle.\nADVERTISEMENT\nPichit, who was sentenced to six months in prison in 2008 along with two colleagues after they tried to bribe Supreme Court officials by handing them a paper bag containing 2 million baht, resigned shortly before the Constitutional Court agreed to proceed with the petition for the probe.\nHIGHLY UNCERTAIN\nAat Pisanwanich, an independent analyst on international economics, said the political situation in Thailand is highly uncertain.\nRELATED\nworld\nAssad\u2019s fall: The end of Syria\u2019s brutal ruling dynasty\nbusiness\nDeputy People's Party leader cites VAT confusion\nHe said if there is a political change, any new coalition government will likely not include the Pheu Thai Party, which currently holds the most seats in parliament.\nIf Mr Srettha is determined to have violated ethics regulations by appointing Pichit, which would pile pressure on him to step down, Mr Aat sees three potential candidates for the next premier.\nThese candidates comprise Paetongtarn Shinawatra, the leader of the Pheu Thai Party and daughter of former premier Thaksin Shinawatra; Chaikasem Nitisiri, a key Pheu Thai Party figure; and Bhumjaithai Party leader and Deputy Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul.\nIf Ms Paetongtarn is chosen, there may be questions about her knowledge and capabilities, affecting already weak confidence in the government, said Mr Aat.\nThe House of Representatives held a three-day debate last week on the budget proposal. Mr Aat says the public has diminishing confidence in the current administration. Chanat Katanyu\nCONFIDENCE ISSUE\nHe said the diminishing confidence in the government stems from the public's reduced faith after the Pheu Thai Party allied with the previous coalition government, sidelining the MFP in forming a government, though the MFP won the most votes in the election.\nAnother factor affecting confidence is the lack of clear results from the government's 10-month tenure. Many projects, such as the Land Bridge, soft power initiatives and the digital wallet handout, have yet to yield tangible outcomes.\nMeanwhile, rising production costs have increased the cost of living, making Thailand one of the most expensive countries in Southeast Asia, surpassing Vietnam, Indonesia and Malaysia, said Mr Aat.\nHe said a reduction of the policy interest rate, long supported by Mr Srettha's government, is worth pursuing as it would ease the burden on debtors and stimulate domestic investment.\nThe Bank of Thailand is reluctant to cut the rate because domestic consumption is still growing, said Mr Aat.\nHowever, the general sentiment of the public and market vendors is spending is not as fluid as in the past, he said.\nIn addition, the rise in consumption is from a low base during the pandemic, making this growth appear illusory, said Mr Aat.\n\"Thai inflation rates are relatively low, which do not align with rising oil prices. Oil prices are a crucial production cost, causing overall production costs to rise, even though inflation does not correspondingly increase,\" he said.\nVisit Limlurcha, vice-chairman of the Thai Chamber of Commerce, said the private sector would like more stability from government.\nMr Srettha and Ms Paetongtarn, middle, pose with young party members after the '10 Months Without Waiting, Moving Forward to Achieve 10 out of 10' event at party headquarters in Bangkok's Huai Khwang district last month.\u2009 Pattarapong Chatpattarasill\nHaving a stable government is crucial for maintaining investor confidence as Thailand vies for foreign direct investment, he said.\nThailand must adjust its production structure, improve competitiveness and drive economic growth, which is still recovering amid the global economic downturn, said Mr Visit.\nAs a result, the private sector and government need to collaborate to foster an economic recovery. In the short term, he said companies want state budget disbursement to be accelerated.\nChaichan Chareonsuk, chairman of the Thai National Shippers' Council, echoed calls for government stability as exporters are buffeted by global uncertainties such as ongoing geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, which increase freight costs and could escalate to become a trade war in the second half of the year.\nMr Chaichan said if Thailand's political situation is stable, it will expedite strategic and budget planning for 2025.\nREELING SALESMAN\nThe uncertain future of Mr Srettha, often dubbed a salesman tasked with attracting foreign investors to Thailand, has manufacturing operators concerned, fearing an impact to investment prospects and the government's flagship economic policies.\nThe prime minister, who insisted on playing the role of a salesman to increase foreign investment, has talked to several companies about expansion into Thailand, especially during his overseas trips.\n\"A change to his premiership will worry foreign investors, resulting in halts or delays to their decisions to invest in Thailand,\" said Kriengkrai Thiennukul, chairman of the Federation of Thai Industries (FTI).\nIf the court's hearing leads to the dismissal of Mr Srettha from the post, political insecurity will erupt, causing investors to wait for clarity on the new premier and whether the same policies will be continued, said Mr Kriengkrai.\nTourists take photos with Wat Arun as a backdrop. Mr Sisdivachr says the tourism sector could be affected by unstable politics following the two Constitutional Court rulings.\u2009Apichart Jinakul\nPolicies such as the 10,000-baht digital money handout, the main campaign pledge by Pheu Thai Party before the 2023 election, are at risk if political turbulence emerges, he said.\nSimilar political uncertainty erupted last year when Pita Limjaroenrat, former leader of the MFP, failed to secure sufficient support in parliament on July 13 to become the country's prime minister, even though the party won the most votes in the May 14 general election.\nThe unclear timeline for a new government dented business confidence at that time, said Mr Kriengkrai.\nDAMAGE CONTROL\nPolitics was among the factors causing the Thai Industries Sentiment Index (TISI) to decrease to 92.3 points in July last year, down from 94.1 points in June, reaching the lowest level in 10 months.\nDomestic politics was among the growing concerns of 1,329 entrepreneurs across 46 industries under the FTI surveyed for the TISI in May this year.\nThe index continued to fall this month to 88.5 from 90.3 points, with 15,000 workers losing their jobs this year.\nHe said political troubles are expected to worsen the Thai economy, which is already plagued by weak consumer spending amid high levels of household debt, which is causing banks to tighten their lending criteria, affecting many businesses such as car manufacturing.\nNarongsak Jivakanun, chief executive of PTT Global Chemical, said he believes the government will not allow the manufacturing sector to stumble from problems caused by politics.\nThailand is a hub of internal combustion engine cars and some electronic products, he said.\n\"We believe the government will manage to keep this status regardless of political problems,\" said Mr Narongsak.\nSAVE TOURISM\nSisdivachr Cheewarattanaporn, president of the Association of Thai Travel Agents, said unstable politics related to the two court cases would undeniably affect the economy, and the tourism sector in particular.\nMr Sisdivachr said partner operators overseas, such as from China, already voiced concerns over the situation.\nAs the tourism sector is quite sensitive to external factors, he said political uncertainties would disrupt the sentiment of inbound tourists who might be worried about unpredictable situations.\n\"It is necessary to prioritise economic and tourism confidence,\" said Mr Sisdivachr.\nContainers for export are sorted at Klong Toey port in Bangkok. Mr Chaichan says Thai shippers want more government stability as exporters deal with geopolitical tension in the Middle East.\u2009Varuth Hirunyatheb\nHe said the government should be proactive in its communication, promoting safe tourism as well as potential destinations in Thailand.\n\"If political tension escalates, it is the duty of all sectors to save the tourism industry by ensuring tourists the industry will remain intact,\" said Mr Sisdivachr.\nIf there are no changes at the administrative levels, the government should use this opportunity to accelerate the market, he said.\nThe visa-free programmes, airport development and promotion of second-tier cities are good initiatives, but there are more things the authorities should do, said Mr Sisdivachr. For instance, nominating five or 10 second-tier cities as pilot cities to develop into major tourism cities, and equipping them with sufficient infrastructure, not only marketing promotions, he said.\nThe government should also listen more to the private sector because companies can supply it with information for effective policy planning, said Mr Sisdivachr.\nPhusadee Arunmas and Molpasorn Shoowong\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat type of hotel location do you prefer in Thailand?\nBeachfront resorts\nCity-center hotels (close to shopping, restaurants, attractions\nSecluded, nature retreats\nNear airports for convenience\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nPolitical\nRisk\nEconomy\nDo you like the content of this article?\n7\n106\nCOMMENT\n(23)",

(File photo: Nutthawat Wichieanbut)\nThe economy is currently at one of its bleakest points, but economic experts expect the situation to bottom out in the second half of the year now that the national budget has been rolled out.\nThings usually seem to be at their worst just before they get better, and the same can be said for the Thai economy, according to Nonarit Bisonyabut, an economist at the Thailand Development Research Institute (TDRI).\nMr Nonarit said the country's economy has entered a dark patch in the short term due to several factors, chief among them the sluggish disbursement of the national budget and high domestic and international interest rates that discourage investments.\nPolitics a potential drag\nADVERTISEMENT\nHowever, he said the situation will improve as global interest rates fall.  The European Central Bank recently lowered interest rates, and the US  is projected to make another cut this year.\nRELATED\nopinion\nNo more bailouts\nbusiness\nttb Wins Euromoney Award for Thailand Corporate Banking Excellence\n\"I'm calling it the '4am economy' because we'll see a ray of light soon. We've seen lower interest rates, with the US expected to make four cuts next year and Thailand likely to follow suit,\" he said.\nMr Nonarit said state spending started in May and will continue to roll out while the details of government projects become clearer. The export sector, meanwhile, is showing signs of improvement, and so is the global economy.\n\"That means we'll be entering the dawn, and the economy is expected to start growing again,\" he said.\nHowever, the pace of the country's economic growth depends greatly on its ability to meet global market demands and tackle the challenges brought by an ageing society.\nMoreover, the state of politics can also retard the economic recovery, especially if Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin is removed from office, causing political disruptions.\nThe case against Mr Srettha concerns the controversial appointment of politician Pichit Chuenban as a PM's Office minister in the last cabinet reshuffle. It was initiated by a group of 40 senators who accused the prime minister and Pichit of breaching cabinet minister ethics.\nThey asked the court if the pair should be removed from office under Section 160 (4) and (5) of the constitution, which deals with the ethics of cabinet ministers.\nThey argued that Pichit was unfit to assume a cabinet post because he served time in jail for contempt of court following a bribery case in which he represented Thaksin Shinawatra in 2008.\n\"The economy also hinges on the political climate. If the country has to find a new prime minister, government policies will be further delayed,\" Mr Nonarit said.\nNonarit: Politics can stunt recovery\nDigital wallet the main priority\nAsked if the Pheu Thai-led government's policy over the past nine months can help stimulate the economy, the TDRI researcher said that apart from delays in the budget rollout, the government is focusing more on the digital wallet scheme than other small-scale economic measures.\n\"The government has to save money for the cash handout programme, so there are no smaller programmes to grease the wheels,\" he said.\nThere remains a big question mark over foreign investments, he said. It is too early to tell if the prime minister's overseas trips to lure foreign investments will bear fruit, although some major companies say they plan to relocate to Thailand.\n\"There are fundamental factors that will lure investments, such as human resources and skill sets. This is a main obstacle and it needs long-term planning to address this,\" he said.\nAfter the political uncertainty is gone and political stability is established, Mr Nonarit said, the government should implement short-term measures and move to address economic reforms, especially building the workforce to support the market.\nWeak exports, lower spending\nTanit Sorat, vice-chairman of the Employers' Confederation of Thai Trade and Industry (EconThai), said the export sector, which is traditionally Thailand's driving force, remains weak, so supply chains have been affected.\nThe industrial sector's production is at 60% of its total capacity due to low purchasing power from the local and foreign markets.\nAs a result, the service, logistics, labour and transport sectors are all suffering from this slowdown of economic activity.\nGlobal factors, such as the trade war between China and the US and tensions in the Middle East -- specifically attacks on shipping vessels in the Red Sea -- have worsened the situation for entrepreneurs.\nWeak consumer spending due to a high level of household debt in the country has brought an unpleasant situation for manufacturers and posed liquidity risks for businesses.\n\"Only the tourism industry seems to be surviving, but the sector makes up for 8% of the country's GDP,\" he said.\nOn foreign investments, he said businesses make long-term investment plans, which are not likely to be halted solely by political issues.\nLast year saw investment values of more than 600 billion baht, of which 70% was the result of foreign direct investment.\nGovt 'sitting on its hands'\nMr Tanit said the government has barely done anything in the past nine months. Instead of suspending debt payments and rolling out a stimulus programme to boost liquidity, the government chose to wait for the digital wallet scheme.\n\"The prime minister comes from the business sector and he should have got to work immediately. He knows household debt is pressing, and businesses need debt payment suspensions and a small stimulus to keep them going. He thinks like a politician, not a businessman,\" he said.\nThe businesses most desperate for assistance are car manufacturers whose supply chain has experienced a 23% contraction, he said, adding that other struggling sectors include rubber products, cassava products and sugar.\nHalf of export clusters have also contracted, and without government intervention, the supply chain will be dragged down, he noted.\nWhile waiting for the digital wallet rollout, the government should devise a programme to stimulate public spending and generate more production. Operating at 50\u201360% of their total capacity, businesses will not be able to retain workers, he said.\n\"Can the government suspend debt payments for a year too? This is a short-term measure. And for the digital wallet, the government should ensure it can be spent anywhere, not just in convenience stores,\" he said.\nTanit: Export sector remains weak\nDeputy Finance Minister Paopoom Rojanasakul said the ruling party has always maintained that the country faces economic stagnation and the digital wallet handouts are intended to jolt the economy back from its slumber.\nMr Paopoom blamed the sluggish economy on three elements: the delay in implementing the 2024 fiscal budget; inefficient fiscal and monetary tools to stimulate the economy, with private sector confidence waning and consumers holding back on spending; and contraction in loans, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).\n\"In short, the fiscal sector lacks ammunition, and while the monetary sector has it, it refuses to use it. This results in banks being cautious about extending loans. With all these elements, the country's economy is sluggish,\" he said.\nState funds kick in\nMr Paopoom said that since the 2024 fiscal budget bill was finally passed after a long delay, funds have been injected into the system.\nAdditionally, measures are now in place to accelerate investments in state enterprises which meet 95% of the government's target.\nThe fiscal 2025 budget is set to take effect in October this year, and coupled with the rollout of the digital wallet scheme, more funds will be injected into the system.\nRegarding the outflow of foreign capital, the deputy finance minister said Thailand has lost its appeal due to a lack of consumption and slow production rates.\nHe admitted that political stability is also a factor in businesses' decision-making. He expressed confidence the government is on the right track to address the economic problems and it has implemented a raft of fiscal measures, including tax incentives, soft loans and upcoming loan guarantee measures.\nCentral bank must play role\nHe said the government needs cooperation from the Bank of Thailand to implement its measures, while stressing that interest rate cuts are necessary.\n\"We have remained firm on the need for a reduction in interest rates, which are not aligned with the economic conditions. With the current inflation rate at 0.6\u20130.7%, which is below the lower threshold of 1%, interest rates look higher than they are supposed to be.\"\nMr Paopoom added the economy is poised to get back on track, especially in the second half of this year, and much-needed reforms such as the Virtual Bank project, credit guarantee upgrades and the retirement lottery policy are in the pipeline.\nPaopoom: Banks cautious about extending loans\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat is your preferred price range per night for accommodation in Bangkok?\n1,000 - 3,000 THB\n3,000 - 5,000 THB\n5,000 - 8,000 THB\nOver 8,000 THB\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nEconomy\nEconomic\nOutlook\nDo you like the content of this article?\n17\n224\nCOMMENT\n(39)",

(Photo:\u2009Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Kingdom of Thailand)\nThere are two main explanations behind Thailand's application to join the Brics group, initially comprising Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa.\nOne explanation is the government's intention to show a quick deliverable in the absence of policy progress elsewhere. The other, more questionable rationale revolves around a personal connection between former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who is the de facto leader of the ruling Pheu Thai Party, and Russian President Vladamir Putin, who presides over Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\nEither way, Thailand's intended entry into Brics is misguided and poses liabilities for Thailand's international standing and credibility. Starting out with Brazil, Russia, India, and China in 2009, the Brics grouping as it is known became complete when South Africa joined in the following year. When these five economies came together, the Global Financial Crisis was ravaging developed economies, particularly the United States, the United Kingdom, Europe, and Japan.\nADVERTISEMENT\nIt was an economic nadir for Western democracies, whereas up-and-coming emerging economies were on the rise. Brics was supposed to promote geoeconomic coordination, collaboration and cooperation among these five major non-Western economies. But the grouping has been reoriented and reshaped from a geoeconomic platform among emerging economies to a geopolitical projection in the intensifying conflict between \"the West\" versus \"the Rest\", which is now transformed into the \"Global South\". Fifteen years later, the tables have turned on the Brics.\nGrowth prospects among emerging markets are no longer stellar, while developed economies have regained economic dynamism based on a decade-long burst of technological innovation. Unsurprisingly, the Brics club has become geopolitical as its geoeconomic prospects shine less brightly and as its core members -- Russia and China -- are in conflict with the West.\nRELATED\nworld\nTaiwanese leader in Hawaii after declaring Taiwan a force for global peace\nopinion\nTV push in need of a better script\nThis conflict pits Russia on the European continent against the European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, underpinned by the US and UK. On the other hand, China is engaged in a geostrategic tussle with the US in the Indo-Pacific, especially in Southeast Asia. Other states that have contentious issues with the West, such as Iran, have been supportive of and sympathetic to the Brics.\nAccordingly, new members were added earlier this year to what is now called \"Brics Plus,\" namely Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, and the United Arab Emirates. Southeast Asian countries, such as Indonesia and Thailand, have shown interest over the past several years.\nSoutheast Asia is strongly wooed by the Brics because it is seen as a fast-growing region in the world economy and an intersection of major-power conflict between the US and China. For most of Southeast Asia, Brics is perceived as a means of geopolitical leverage vis-\u00e0-vis the West, despite limited geoeconomic benefit. On the other, joining the Brics risks taking Southeast Asian states into a conflict arena they have tried to avoid.\nIn the end, it is Thailand that opted to join while Indonesia opted out. Other Southeast Asian countries are standing aside for the time being. Thailand's cabinet under the leadership of Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin in late May 2024 formally announced a decision to join the Brics.\nLast week, Foreign Minister Maris Sangiampongsa travelled to Russia for a Brics meeting to officially register Thailand's application. A major reason behind such a hasty and misguided move is domestic consumption. Mr Srettha has made little headway with entering the OECD (Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development) or striking a Schengen visa-free deal. His government's FTA negotiations with the EU are taking longer than expected, and even the EFTA-Thai FTA may not be concluded this year. Thailand's FTA playbook is slow and inadequate. Meanwhile, the government's 10,000 baht digital wallet scheme, \"Land Bridge\" and \"soft power\" programmes also are stymied and stuck. Brics is thus played to domestic audiences as a deliverable achievement.\nYet the other plausible driver is the Thaksin-Putin connection from two decades ago when both leaders were known to enjoy a strong and warm rapport. The fact that Mr Maris is seen as a Thaksin acolyte and nominee rather than a chief diplomat with autonomy and latitude reinforces the suspicion behind Thailand's Brics interest and closer ties with Russia, which has been alienated and ostracised by most of the international community, and overwhelmingly condemned by major United Nations resolutions since its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Thaksin is known to favour personal ties and diplomatic camaraderie at the top level, such as his evident rapport with Hun Sen, the former Cambodian prime minister who still wields decisive clout in his country.\nIt was odd for Thailand to be interested in joining OECD concurrently with Brics because these two outfits hold divergent objectives, one representing developed countries and the other the developing members of the Global South. Although it would take several years to complete, joining OECD makes more sense because its compliance criteria would put pressure on Thailand to usher in urgently needed domestic structural reforms. Joining Brics puts Thailand in dubious company whose direction and agenda appear inconsistent with Thailand's intention to stay in a moving balance between developed and developing countries.\nThis is why Indonesia has stayed out. Indonesia's interest in closely managing ties with both China and India, or even Brazil and South Africa, can be served bilaterally and on other platforms without the liabilities of being in a pact with Russia and Iran. Indonesian leaders are also wary of the Brics agenda and future anti-Western manoeuvres the group may take.\nThe stated Thai rationale for joining Brics, to seek more influence within the Global South, does not wash. There are other ways that Thailand can raise its game among developing countries. Never colonised and thus free of the colonial baggage that motivates the Global South, Thailand should be maximising its role as a bridge and broker between developed and developing countries.\nBrics is a road Thailand should not be taking. Trying to join requires a more convincing explanation than the government has given.\nThitinan Pongsudhirak\nSenior fellow of the Institute of Security and International Studies at Chulalongkorn University\nA professor and senior fellow of the Institute of Security and International Studies at Chulalongkorn University\u2019s Faculty of Political Science, he earned a PhD from the London School of Economics with a top dissertation prize in 2002.

By 2025, the company aims to launch its first \"smart service robot\", capable of more complex services for people with disabilities. By 2030, these robots could be protecting people from hazardous jobs, according to the company's plan.\nTo achieve this level of development, there are two main challenges: battery capacity and artificial muscles, Lee said.\nFirstly, unlike electric vehicles (EVs), humanoid robots lack space for large batteries, so for them to operate independently the energy density of batteries must improve. Secondly, current engines lack the flexibility of human muscles, which can exert force over a wide range and can be both hard and soft, fitting closely to the skin, according to Lee.\nCurrently, to ensure realism the dolls can often weigh up to 40 kilogrammes (88 pounds), which is too heavy for the motor and poses a risk of falling or hurting the user.\n\"Therefore in the first stage, we focused on reducing the weight through improvements in materials and production processes,\" Lee said. By July 2023, their 172-centimetre-tall doll weighed just 29kg.\nLee said robots that could do household chores was a societal vision, but it remained a long time away. Robotics companies could use servo motors to achieve certain functions, but considering stability and cost, commercialisation was still in the distance.\n\"The entire industry will need about 10 years to achieve the goal,\" he said.\nIn addition to technical difficulties, Starpery also faces cost and ethics challenges.\nReducers - which transfer power between the motor and the robot joints - are key components in the mechanical system of humanoid robots. They generally account for 30% of the robot's cost and might need multiple gears at different joints.\n\"We strive to decrease the cost so that more people can afford realistic dolls, while adding motors will increase the cost [to] some extent,\" Lee said.\nDolls from Starpery, which has a complete supply chain and lower manufacturing costs, are priced around US$1,500. An advanced Harmony doll produced by Abyss Creations in the United States starts at $6,000.\nStarpery is in Shenzhen, in southern Guangdong province, which is now the world's largest production base for adult products, providing the company with price advantages.\n\"The supply chain in Guangdong is complete, and manufacturers respond quickly to market demands. New technologies can usually be seen in products, the following month it shows up somewhere else,\" Lee said.\nBesides Starpery, other Chinese manufacturers are also integrating AI into physical dolls. WMdoll, in Zhongshan, another Guangdong city, and EXdoll, in Dalian, in the northeastern province of Liaoning, also plan to launch interactive products.\nEmployees work at the office of humanoid robots' developer Ex-Robots in Dalian, Liaoning province, China, on June 6, 2024. (Photo: Reuters)\nIn the past year, large language models have significantly advanced various sectors, notably transforming the humanoid robot industry.\n\"Innovations spurred by tailored models, trained on diverse data sets, have unleashed a wave of products that are transforming industry landscapes and user interactions,\" said Tang Jie, a professor of computer science at Tsinghua University.\nIn the humanoid robot industry, for example, large language models play an important role in its development.\nOu Jinyan, spokesperson for LimX Dynamics, a robot development company, said: \"It not only speeds up iterations in robotics, enhancing motion control, but also produces a suite of user-friendly tools that significantly [boost] developer productivity.\"\nIn addition to technical issues, the industry faces very human considerations. AI-driven sex robots could blur ethical boundaries and reinforce harmful attitudes regarding consent and negative gender stereotypes.\nCriticism includes the view that overreliance on AI companions for sexual or emotional fulfilment might lead to less genuine human connection, affecting a user's ability to form healthy relationships with real people.\nAnd the rapid development of AI-driven sex robots outpaces existing legal and regulatory frameworks, leading to a legal grey area concerning their use, ownership and the responsibilities of manufacturers and users.\nIn its 2023 paper, \"Research Report on AI Ethics Governance\", the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology stated: \"AI that can make decisions under certain conditions could challenge human autonomy and self-perception. Large language models also pose risks of data leaks and privacy violations, as information from users could become material for training generative AI.\"\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat is your budget range for purchasing a house in Thailand?\nUnder 3 million THB\n3 million - 5 million THB\n5 million - 8 million THB\n8 million - 12 million THB\nOver 12 million THB\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nTechnology\nSex\nArtificial intelligence\nScience\nRobots\nDo you like the content of this article?\n96\n47\nCOMMENT\n(43)",

        "content": "Business\nGeneral\nClimate changes\nThai businesses are increasingly under pressure to curb their carbon emissions, as the government moves the country away from a voluntary system and towards compulsory rules\nPUBLISHED : 10 Jun 2024 at 07:41\nNEWSPAPER SECTION:\nBusiness\nWRITER:\nWichit Chantanusornsiri, Somruedi Banchongduang, and Yuthana Praiwan\n&nbsp; Small\n&nbsp; Medium\n&nbsp; Large\n120\n6\nThailand is drafting a climate change bill, with a plan to impose a carbon tax on manufacturers.\nA government pledge to cut a large amount of greenhouse gas emissions is expected to reshape how Thai businesses operate.\nAuthorities are pushing ahead with Thailand's first climate change bill, aimed at achieving carbon neutrality and net-zero targets, which were announced by the Prayut Chan-o-cha government at the UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow in 2021.\nVowing to strike a balance between carbon dioxide emissions and absorption by 2050, along with a balance between greenhouse gas emissions and absorption by 2065, the government needs to enforce rules requiring businesses to take stronger actions to reduce their carbon footprint.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe new bill, slated to be forwarded to the cabinet for approval in the third quarter, makes it mandatory for entrepreneurs to add environmental measures to their business processes, including monitoring and reporting the amount of greenhouse gases they release as well as paying a new tax based on carbon dioxide emissions.\nThe bill also promotes the use of funds and loans to assist entrepreneurs in transitioning to eco-friendly practices.\nCARBON TAX\nPornchai Thiraveja, director-general of the Fiscal Policy Office (FPO), said the climate change bill plans to impose a carbon tax on manufacturers.\nThe bill stipulates the collection of a carbon tax on goods based on the assessed amount of greenhouse gases in a product's life cycle.\nAccording to Mr Pornchai, given the lack of clarity regarding the scope and rates of the carbon tax, it is not yet possible to assess the impact on the business sector.\nThe bill was drafted based on the 2016 Paris Agreement, which required participating countries to report the amount of greenhouse emissions they release into the atmosphere and arrange plans to adapt to climate change.\nUnder the bill, businesses in major sectors, such as energy, transport, agriculture and industry, must collect data on greenhouse gas emissions and report it to the Office of Natural Resources and Environmental Policy and Planning.\nA similar attempt to impose a tax or fine on polluters is included in the clean air bill, which aims to reduce air pollution. This bill was sent to the House of Representatives for consideration.\nThe FPO is studying these two draft laws to establish tax measures that support the transition to a low-carbon economy, which requires further discussions with relevant agencies, he said.\nFINANCIAL HELP\nAnother proposal in the climate change bill is to focus on enhancing financial support, including soft loans from banks and environmental funds, to help businesses invest in green technology.\nThis helps small entrepreneurs with limited budgets that want to cut greenhouse gases from their manufacturing processes, said Chayasak Ittisiri, managing director for Thailand at SP Group.\nSP Group is a Singapore-based energy solutions provider and electricity transmission operator that is monitoring the crafting and implementation of the new bill to help the government and businesses achieve net-zero goals, he said.\nThere is a significant global need for financial support related to climate change. Data indicates the average value of annual global climate finance is US$1.3 trillion, which is much lower than the estimated average financial need to combat climate change of $8.6 trillion per year, roughly six times less than is required, according to Export-Import Bank of Thailand (Exim Bank).\nIn Thailand the government could set up a new fund worth 10 billion baht to help businesses deal with higher costs resulting from a shift towards eco-friendly operations, said Kriengkrai Thiennukul, chairman of the Federation of Thai Industries.\nMany other countries have already established such funds to help entrepreneurs transform their operations and Thailand should follow this trend, he said.\n\"Businesses need to buy new machines and invest in clean energy, which means they need to bear more costs,\" said Mr Kriengkrai.\n\"We are concerned about small and medium-sized enterprises [SMEs], which will face a challenge in adapting to the requirements in the climate change bill,\" he said.\nSanan Angubolkul, chairman of the Thai Chamber of Commerce, said he agrees with the need to provide financial support to SMEs to help them better access loans to comply with the state's green initiative.\nHe applauded the establishment of \"decarbonisation loans\" under a government-sponsored fund for SME operators wishing to invest in equipment and facilities that reduce their environmental impact, notably reducing carbon dioxide emissions.\nKasikorn Research Center anticipates the new bill will affect 14 carbon-intensive industries in Thailand, representing 6.5 trillion baht or 37% of the country's GDP.\nINEVITABLE PATH\nThe planned climate change bill is expected by companies amid intensified international campaigns against global warming, making it imperative for enterprises of all sizes to redesign their operations to be more eco-friendly, said Mr Chayasak.\nThai companies have for many years been implementing measures to curb carbon dioxide emissions on a voluntary basis, but this bill will commit them to taking serious action to better deal with this environmental problem, he said.\n\"There may be some disagreement, but even opponents of the bill will, sooner or later, need to join the government to cut carbon dioxide emissions because not only is Thailand requiring stricter regulations, but other countries that import from the region also improved environmental standards,\" said Mr Chayasak.\nOne example is the EU's Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), he said. CBAM is a non-tariff barrier meant to encourage entrepreneurs to use more renewable power in their manufacturing to reduce their carbon footprint.\nThe transitional phase of CBAM, which started last October, requires importers of iron and steel, aluminium, cement, fertiliser, electricity and hydrogen to report greenhouse gas emissions embedded in their imports without being subject to financial payments or adjustments.\nImporters are scheduled to pay a levy for CBAM certificates from Jan 1, 2026.\nMr Chayasak said he believes other economic tools similar to CBAM will be enforced by developed countries, led by the US, accelerating changes to traditional manufacturing reliant on fossil fuels.\nAccording to the report by Exim Bank, the increasing severity of climate change has led many governments to implement roughly 18,000 environmental trade measures, with an average annual increase of 16% during the period from 2013 to 2022. This is particularly notable in Thailand's major export markets, such as the US, EU, Japan, China and India, which collectively accounted for 51% of the total export value in 2023.\nThailand exports relatively few environmentally friendly products, accounting for 7.6% of the total export value in 2021. This is lower than other countries, as 15.4% of Germany's shipments are deemed eco-friendly, Japan 15%, China 10.4% and South Korea 10.2%.\nNET ZERO\nMany businesses in the energy and industrial sectors have already joined the government to launch campaigns against climate change, creating their&nbsp;own plans to achieve net-zero targets.\nLarge companies are working on measures to reduce carbon dioxide and greenhouse gas emissions, with other firms determined to follow suit.\nPTT Exploration and Production Plc (PTTEP), the oil and gas drilling arm of PTT Plc, aims to achieve a net-zero target by 2050, 15 years faster than the government's goal. The company still plans to extract gas and oil, two key fossil fuels blamed for releasing carbon dioxide, but it wants to use technology to curb their emissions.\nAccording to Montri Rawanchaikul, chief executive of PTTEP, the company is developing Thailand's first carbon capture and storage (CCS) facility at the Arthit gas field in the Gulf of Thailand, one of several efforts aimed at helping the government curb carbon dioxide emissions.\nPTTEP expects the CCS project to store up to 1 million tonnes of carbon dioxide during gas production at Arthit by 2027.\nLast year, the company completed the preliminary front-end engineering and design phase of the project. The CCS facility is scheduled to start operating by 2027.\nThe Gulf of Thailand offers great potential to store carbon dioxide, amounting to roughly 40 million tonnes a year, because geographically the terrain is a sink area, which is suitable for the storage of carbon dioxide, according to PTTEP.\nSiam Cement Group (SCG), Thailand's largest cement manufacturer and industrial conglomerate, also wants to achieve a net-zero target by 2050 and aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 20% by 2030.\nThe company is increasingly focused on manufacturing and selling more eco-friendly products and services, said Thammasak Sethaudom, president and chief executive of SCG.\nSCG expects revenue from its green innovations to comprise 67% of total revenue by 2030, up from 53% at present, he said.\nThe company developed a new cement that reduces carbon dioxide emissions by roughly 15-20%, which can be used for structural work and interior decoration.\nThe Creative Climate Research Center established by KBank and partners aims to build awareness and provide information about sustainable economies.\nGLOBAL RECOGNITION\nThe travel and tourism industry is also more focused on environmental issues.\nIn Thailand, some tourism areas were selected as low-carbon destinations for future development, such as Phangnga, where the previous government planned pilot projects on the beach and island areas of Khao Lak, Koh Kho Khao, Koh Yao Yai and Koh Yao Noi.\nSiripakorn Cheawsamoot, deputy governor for Europe, Africa, the Middle East and the Americas at the Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT), said the agency selected Phangnga as the host of Thailand Travel Mart Plus last week based on its potential as an emerging destination in the South and its sustainable practices.\nHe said European visitors and tour agencies seek out accommodation, tours and activities that cause little to no pollution, and prefer using supplies that are equipped with sustainable standards.\nSustainability has become a key inquiry from large tour companies in Europe that must comply with climate laws in their home countries, such as the European Climate Law adopted by the EU Council in 2021.\nThe TAT is also helping Krabi host the Tourism Cares Meaningful Summit in 2025, connecting tourism stakeholders with local businesses that have adopted sustainable practices for their products and services.\nBLUE OCEAN\nPairote Cheunkrut, chief strategy officer at Bank of Ayudhya (Krungsri), said the draft climate change bill will fundamentally transform Thailand from a voluntary carbon regime to a compliance-based one. This shift will introduce new risk parameters, specifically transition risks, to commercial banks, he said.\nAccording to Mr Pairote, banks will integrate transition risk management and mitigation into their policy formulations and underwriting processes, while supporting customers who could be affected by the bill.\nBanks may identify business opportunities in sectors or industries affected by the bill by providing financial products and services that aid clients in their transitions, adaptations and adjustments, he said.\nMr Pairote said Krungsri formulated a sustainable lending credit policy that includes climate risk, particularly transition risk, as a core component. This policy covers risk management frameworks and positive listings for activities embedded with environmental and climate benefits.\nOnce the new bill is implemented, the bank plans to build on this policy to facilitate Thailand's transition towards a low-carbon economy, he said.\nDuangkamol Limpuangthip, head of the SME Banking Group at Krungsri, said the bill will impact all businesses, including SMEs. The bank has been working to raise awareness among SMEs to prepare them for the transition to ESG (environmental, social and governance) practices, she said.\nKrungsri organised various knowledge-sharing activities over the past few years, including ESG events, seminars and the Krungsri ESG Academy project, to help customers create and implement transition plans for their businesses.\nMs Duangkamol said the bank collaborates with partners through the Krungsri ESG Ecosystem to provide solutions and transition loans to support customers with ESG plans.\nKasikorn Research Center (K-Research) anticipates the new bill will affect 14 carbon-intensive industries in Thailand, representing 6.5 trillion baht or 37% of the country's GDP. These industries will face increased costs from carbon footprint assessments, an emissions trading scheme, and a carbon tax, noted the research firm.\nGreenhouse gas reduction will become a new standard in business operations, requiring companies to consistently monitor carbon footprints, reduce fossil fuel consumption, and invest in renewable energy to remain competitive in both domestic and international markets, according to K-Research.\nPipit Aneknithi, president of Kasikornbank (KBank), said the bank is transitioning to sustainable finance in line with the Bank of Thailand's regulations and is ready to comply with the government's climate change bill.\nThe bank expanded its portfolio of sustainable finance products, KBank Green Banking, to 130 billion baht and aims to reach 200 billion by 2030, although it recently reported it expects to reach this target before 2030, he said.\nKBank wants to fully transform its existing loan portfolio into a green loan portfolio by 2065, said Mr Pipit.\nHe said the bank supports SME customers transitioning from \"brown\" industries to less environmentally harmful ones, following the central bank's guidance.\nKBank, in collaboration with the public and private sector as well as educational institutions, established the Creative Climate Research Center to build awareness and provide information about sustainable economies to the public.\nAdditial reporting: Lamonphet Apisitniran, Narumon Kasemsuk and  Phusadee Arunmas\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat type of building do you prefer for a condominium?\nHigh-rise (more than 10 floors)\nMid-rise (5-10 floors)\nLow-rise (less than 5 floors)\nNo preference\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nCilmate\nChange\nDo you like the content of this article?\n7\n57\nCOMMENT\n(6)",

His non-stop whirlwind trips to lure investors including Microsoft, Tesla, Formula One, Tomorrowland and Art Basel to Thailand earned him the image of the salesman on a Time magazine cover. With the government's 10-month report card out and future plans in discussion, there has been both applause and confusion.\nWith the return of Thaksin Shinawatra, the former fugitive prime minister who made a miraculous recovery after a few months in police hospital instead of state prison, Thailand is bubbling with excitement as he has defied the law, and the Pheu Thai Party is now surging ahead to boost the morale of the people.\nThaksin is making headlines with every move and the sparkling optimism has overshadowed Srettha and ambitious campaigns such as the digital wallet scheme (coming soon) and land bridge (coming later). The Pheu Thai Party's plan to apply a quick fix to raise GDP and rescue the country's struggling economy via soft power is also in question as there have been claims it is a PR campaign to make Thaksin's daughter Paetongtarn, leader of Pheu Thai Party and chairwoman of the Thailand Creative Culture Agency (THACCA), the next prime minister. Until now, there has been big talk but little to show. What has gone wrong, or rather what has not gone right?\nADVERTISEMENT\nForming THACCA and making soft power a part of its election campaign to lure votes from the youth and creative sectors was a risky gamble by Pheu Thai. Soft power does not belong to any political party. Claiming that soft power is a Pheu Thai initiative is simply pretentious and misleading. Due to wide-ranging definitions of soft power by bureaucracy, politicians and cultural sectors, the term has caused confusion. Some civil servant sectors simply change their work to suit the soft power scheme, and politicians are split in opinion as soft power is associated with the ruling Pheu Thai Party. Meanwhile, artists, craftsmen, performers, actors, writers, filmmakers, designers, musicians and gamers question the meaning as the term is defined with political motivation.\nA public hearing on a proposed legislative draft by THACCA.\nRELATED\nthailand\nUnesco lists tom yum kung as humanity\u2019s intangible cultural heritage\nthailand\nPhuket cabaret seen as lucrative cash cow\nSoft power campaigns so far have been about populism. For example, One Family One Soft Power (Ofos) aims to create 20 million jobs with a minimum annual salary of 200,000 baht. There is also the promotion of gimmicky contests to attract tourists in record time such as eating popcorn and Chinese doughnuts, wearing elephant-pattern pantaloons and phi ta khon masks, and bursting balloons with boxing gloves. The Maha Songkran Water Festival, slated as part of the soft power initiative to attract tourists with weeks of wet and wild water splashing, was wasted with money down the drain.\nHowever, Unesco did name Thai New Year as an Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity for preserving the tradition of reunion and respect for ancestors and families after the rice harvest by pouring water as a symbol of cleansing, reverence and good fortune. By distorting traditional values for the sake of tourism, the charm and sincerity of Songkran has been sadly diluted.\nAlso, instead of Paetongtarn dressed as Miss Songkran Mahothon Devi riding a peacock or squirting water with people in scorching heat, the soft power lady opted to take a holiday in Hong Kong. Songkran was too hot for her to handle. To be fair, Paetongtarn cannot be blamed for the lack of positive results from soft power projects. After all, her role is controlled and manipulated by her father and his cronies. Her speeches are written for her to laud the Pheu Thai Party. It's not surprising that soft power, which promised jobs and prosperity, has been met with a lukewarm response from creative sectors and cultural workers.\nIn an attempt to recreate the success of the Korean Wave, THACCA's emulation of the Korea Creative Content Agency has failed to create hype. The Thailand Creative &amp; Design Center and Creative Economy Agency are unable to connect with stakeholders in design, fashion, performance, visual arts, music, film, games and entertainment.\nThe resignation of the chair and members of the THACCA fashion subcommittee indicates a lack of confidence among the creative sector. Design Week Festival ran with a theme of revitalising the potential of Bangkok but it too was criticised as the content was weak and did not meet expectations. However, the visual arts sector has been most disappointing with little to show.\nAlthough the Thailand Biennale in Chiang Rai has been more successful than previous editions in Krabi and Korat, credit belongs to the Gen Prayut Chan-o-cha government that initiated the project. Srettha and Paetongtarn who briefly attended the ribbon-cutting ceremony in Chiang Rai could hardly claim that Thailand Biennale was part of the Pheu Thai soft power campaign. Yet, there was still behind-the-scenes drama involving a power struggle among civil servants, local politicians, artists and curators. Also, artists and curators who supported the Move Forward Party have different views to Pheu Thai Party's definition of soft power.\nSo far, there is a lack of strategy and plan to improve the art ecosystem in Thailand. By announcing that Thai artists will be represented on the international stage but without any assurance of budget or preparation, there is much to be done by THACCA to convince people.\nTake for example the 60th Venice Biennale, the world grandest international art festival that recently opened with more than 90 national pavilions and hundreds of related exhibitions and cultural events. Running for eight months, Venice Biennale is a prime example of creative economy and soft power success blending heritage and the contemporary that attracts visitors.\nIt's a great shame that THACCA missed this golden opportunity to put the Thai Pavilion back on the art world map after a long absence due to scandals in the selection procedure and protests by artists. With the theme \"Foreigners Everywhere\", there is the presence of Singapore, Philippines, China, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Bangladesh, Timor-Leste and Mongolia. However, the Thai Pavilion is nowhere to be seen. The THACCA and Ministry of Culture must take full responsibility for the absence at this world event.\nAs head of the THACCA, Paetongtarn should dedicate more time on her mission of improving infrastructure and human resources in various areas of art and culture. She and her team should revive art projects begun during the Thaksin government that failed to be fully implemented. The National Art Gallery at the Thailand Cultural Centre, planned by a Thaksin government to be Asean's cultural gateway, stands like an abandoned warehouse rotting in the heat. Millions of baht were spent on a national art collection and now artworks are stored away with improper temperature and humidity control. The THACCA declared last November that its priority was to upgrade the National Art Gallery into a leading destination in the region. Thus far, there is still no clear plan for this.\nAnother failed art project that needs urgent revival is the abandoned 2004 tsunami memorial at Nopparat Thara National Park in Krabi. In 2006, the Embassy of France, the Ministry of Culture and world-renowned artist Louise Bourgeois installed public sculptures in memory of victims of the 2004 tsunami. This art memorial attracted visitors and was the first and only public art project by the late Bourgeois in Southeast Asia. Due to a lack of care and budget, the memorial was left in ruins and Bourgeois' sculptures were locked for years in a safe at the Krabi governor's office. The goal of the Louise Bourgeois Foundation is to have the original sculptures and not reproductions on display at the National Park. THACCA's mission is to reinstall Bourgeois' public sculptures and garden and promote Krabi as a world-class art destination to bring income from cultural tourism.\nTHACCA has not hit the ground running. After 10 months, there is little to show in terms of positive output. \"Platform On Soft Power: Thailand's Next Weapon\", with Paetongtarn chatting with a soap opera promoter and restauranter and organised by the Thai Rath Forum, was a PR campaign that lacked substance, a mission or goals.\nA public hearing on a proposed legislative draft by the THACCA to promote a creative culture, led by Suraphong Surpwongli and various speakers at BACC, last week debated the socioeconomic system. Artists and cultural workers complained that the THACCA draft is highly bureaucratic and geared too much towards the commoditisation of Thai art and culture. By overlooking the well-being of cultural workers, the draft excludes many sectors who make up the core of the Thai art ecosystem.\nOveremphasis on Thai talent for sale to suit the political goals of the Pheu Thai Party distorts the potential of soft power, which can be far more impactful. Soft power as Pheu Thai Party's political agenda has a long and uphill struggle ahead.\nProf Apinan Poshyananda is the author of The Future: Post-Cold War, Postmodernism, Post-Marginalia (Playing With Slippery Lubricants)  In Tradition And Change.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nIf you were to buy real estate in Thailand outside of Bangkok, which area would be your top choice?\nChiang Mai\nPhuket\nPattaya\nKhao Yai\nKoh Samui\nHua Hin\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nSoft power\nDo you like the content of this article?\n25\n2\nCOMMENT\n(2)",

By that, he means that America is the only power simultaneously mighty and benevolent enough to preserve whatever is left of a liberal order -- one in which rules and multilateral institutions govern, among other things, a system of relatively free international finance and trade.\nBut what if the US itself, even under Mr Biden, turns against the system it's supposed to guard, becoming an agent of economic nationalism, international fragmentation and hostile bloc-building?\nDoubts to that effect have popped up throughout the Pax Americana, the long period of US leadership that followed World War II. What most frightened America's friends abroad, though, was Donald Trump in the White House. His \"America First\" worldview was a throwback to a much earlier US stance of isolationism and nationalism.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe infamous symbol of that older tradition was the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930. Named after its sponsors, it hiked duties on America's trading partners, thus making US consumers and importers poorer and foreign exporters angrier. Their governments \"retaliated\" (a stupid term since they only impoverished their own importers out of spite) with tariffs against the US. And so it went, in round after round of \"beggar-thy-neighbour\" protectionism that made the Great Depression worse and nations more aggressive. Within a decade, the world was at war. The US Senate today calls Smoot-Hawley \"among the most catastrophic acts in congressional history\".\nWith that disaster in mind, US leaders, after the war, went the other way. With its economic, military and soft power unrivalled, Washington built political institutions such as the United Nations as well as economic organs such as the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which in 1995 became the World Trade Organization. Their job was to set rules for finance and trade, at least for the free (as opposed to communist) world and parts of the non-aligned (or \"Third World\").\nRELATED\nopinion\nA restored WTO just the tonic\nworld\nAstra vaccine fears grow over clot concerns\nWith the US guarding the system, trade and capital flows increased and then soared after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. This heyday of globalisation lifted millions, if not billions, of people worldwide out of poverty. But there were also costs: some workers in some countries, including the US, lost their livelihoods whenever the economics of comparative advantage made production elsewhere in the world more efficient or when some countries -- notably China, even though it joined the WTO in 2001 -- didn't play by the rules.\nThese frustrations caused a protectionist backlash in the US. Some pols and pundits were livid at China in particular and wanted to hit back at its foul play while bypassing the WTO, which in theory has mechanisms to settle such disputes. Others, notably Mr Trump, were irate at almost all of America's trading partners, especially if the US ran current-account deficits with them, as in the case of Germany.\nOnce in the Oval Office, Mr Trump went full Smoot-Hawley. He imposed tariffs on steel and aluminium from lots of countries, on Chinese goods from clothes and shoes to furniture and electronics, and even on stuff made in Europe and other countries that consider themselves friends. The bigger surprise is what Mr Biden did when he took over. Instead of reverting to a liberal trade policy in keeping with his internationalist reputation, he kept the Trump tariffs. He even added some: This month, the US slapped a new round of restrictions on Chinese electric vehicles, solar panels and more. On trade, Mr Trump and Mr Biden now vie for the presidency in nuanced shades of the same protectionist hue: Mr Trump promises to erect huge trade barriers around much of the economy, Mr Biden merely to wall off specific sectors -- the administration calls that approach \"small yard and high fence\".\nCounting only tariffs, quotas and other trade barriers, in fact, understates the nationalist turn in US economic policy. Mr Biden is especially proud of his industrial policy, embedded into legislative packages with misleading titles such as the CHIPS and Science Act or the Inflation Reduction Act and consisting of huge subsidies to American companies. As with tariffs, European and Asian countries are retaliating with their own industrial policies. \"We've got a subsidies war, which is worse than a trade war, because subsidies are harder to roll back,\" says Adam Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.\nMr Biden has continued in the same vein as Mr Trump in another disturbing way. He's been dissing the WTO by blocking nominees to its appellate courts and thus sabotaging the entire multilateral trade regime. Instead, Mr Biden is betting on bilateral and regional trade deals, hoping to hug democracies and snub autocracies. As Mathew Burrows and Robert Manning at the Stimson Center show, global trade and finance are fragmenting into rival and increasingly hostile blocs, one centred on China and extending into the \"Global South\", another around the US and other Western countries. This trend, they think, will \"increase the likelihood of conflict\" and is reminiscent of the 1930s.\nThe Biden administration's defence, and indeed the entire \"new Washington consensus\", counters that in this new quasi-Cold War with China, as in the original Cold War with the Soviet Union, security trumps markets. That's true, up to a point. It would be naive and dangerous if the US and its allies, in the name of free trade, made themselves dependent on, say, Chinese lithium or dysprosium or semiconductors.\nBut is steel really one of these sensitive \"dual-use\" technologies? Are solar panels, ship-to-shore cranes, face masks or other items on Mr Biden's latest tariff list? By all means, the US and its allies should, in the argot of the new Washington consensus, \"de-risk\" their ties with China. But the suspicion remains that the US, across both sides of the aisle and both presidential campaigns, has turned protectionist.\nIf so, this shift has frightening implications for the world economy and world peace. Hegemonic Stability Theory, which posits that the world needs a custodian power to maintain order and prosperity, assumes that the global leader is not only mighty enough but also willing to deploy its might to preserve a liberal system. \"It's about benevolent or malevolent hegemony,\" Mr Posen of the Peterson Institute told me. \"Not: Is the US capable? But: What does it intend to do?\"\nHistory teaches, Hegel said, \"that peoples and governments never have learned anything from history.\" If the US, under Mr Biden or any president, wants to remain the indispensable nation, it better bone up on Smoot-Hawley's ugly history, prove Hegel wrong, and once again act like a benevolent leader.\u2009\u00a92024 Bloomberg\nAndreas Kluth is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering US diplomacy, national security, and geopolitics.

(Photo: Nutthawat Wichieanbut)\nThai exports rebounded to growth in April, following a sharp 10.9% decline in March, driven by the improving global economy and an easing of the average inflation rate worldwide.\nThe Commerce Ministry reported on Thursday customs-based exports expanded by 6.8% year-on-year in April to US$23.3 billion (834 billion baht), while shipments in the real sector (excluding gold, oil-related products, and weaponry) increased by 11.4%.\nImports increased by 8.3% in April to $24.9 billion, resulting in a trade deficit of $1.64 billion. For the first four months of 2024, the country's exports gained 1.4% to $94.3 billion, while imports increased by 4.9% to $100 billion, resulting in a trade deficit of $6.11 billion.\nADVERTISEMENT\nExports of agricultural and agro-industrial products increased by 2% year-on-year in April to $4.94 billion, led by rice (+91.5%), rubber (+36.2%), canned and processed seafood (+14.8%), pet foods (+52.9%), processed chicken (+17.2%), drinks (+10.5%), canned and processed fruit (+21.5%), and sauces and preparations (+23.2%).\nIndustrial product shipments rose by 9.2% to $17.5 billion, led by automobiles, equipment and auto parts (+20.4%), computers, equipment and parts (+62%), machinery and mechanical components (+58.8%), air conditioners and components (+12.9%), iron and steel (+23.3%), and electrical transformers and components (+32.4%).\nRELATED\nbusiness\nMinistry eyes digital GDP growth of 5.7%\nthailand\nMaris to visit Myanmar next week\nPoonpong Naiyanapakorn, director-general of the Trade Policy and Strategy Office, attributed the April uptick to easing inflation conditions among trading partners compared with the previous year, expanding industrial production worldwide as orders increased, and significant demand for agricultural products driven by rising global market prices.\n\"The trend is expected to continue increasing in May, particularly for fruit exports, as it is the season for durian. Export trends for the second quarter are forecast to increase by 0.81%, and the Commerce Ministry maintains its export target at 1-2%, barring any unforeseen risks such as geopolitical tensions in the Middle East which warrant close monitoring,\" he said.\nIn the first quarter, the value of exports declined by 0.2% to $70.9 billion, while the value of imports rose by 3.8% to $75.4 billion, resulting in a trade deficit of $4.47 billion.\nAccording to Mr Poonpong, risk factors exerting pressure on export prospects include Thailand's hot  and dry weather conditions, the economic slowdown in China and Japan, and the conflict in Myanmar's Myawaddy.\nChaichan Chareonsuk, chairman of the Thai National Shippers' Council (TNSC), said Thai exports in the second quarter are expected to increase by 1%, as rice, rubber, auto parts, and electronic components continue to drive momentum.\nHowever, a significant risk is geopolitical issues in the Red Sea, leading to volatile, rising shipping costs, said Mr Chaichan.\nHe also called on the meeting of commercial counsellors from around the world to be held in Thailand next week to help expedite efforts to reduce production costs and seek new markets with potential, as traditional markets such as China and the US are decelerating.\nIn addition, the government is being urged to rev up the promotion of soft power products in the food and textile sectors.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat hotel facilities are most important to you when choosing accommodation?\nSwimming pool\nFitness center\nRestaurants and bars\nMassage and spa\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nThailand\nExport\nDo you like the content of this article?\n3\n12\nCOMMENT\n(1)",

This event unveiled future plans and aims to elevate cooperation in the healthcare industry, trade economy, and culture between China and Thailand, transforming a new dimension of China-Thailand development cooperation for sustainable growth. The event was honoured by the presence of Mr. Jakkapong Sangmanee, Minister Attached to the Prime Minister's Office, and Mr. Krisda Tanterdtit, Secretary to the Minister of Commerce, as well as representatives from the Chinese Embassy in Thailand, the Chairman of the Chinese Cultural Relics Association, and the Vice Chairman of China News Service. The senior management of the Reignwood Group warmly welcomed the attendees.\nMr. Krisda Tanterdtit, Secretary to the Minister of Commerce, gave a speech at the event, stating that ASEAN and China have a strategic partnership relationship in all dimensions - political, economic, social, and cultural. He mentioned that the Ministry of Commerce places great importance on promoting cooperation with various provinces in China and on strengthening economic cooperation to promote sustainable joint economic growth that benefits all countries in the region.\n\"The world is currently restructuring its trade patterns and relationships to become a form of cultural marketing, in order to transmit valuable cultures to various countries around the world. As the Ministry of Commerce is pushing Thailand's Soft Power policy in the areas of food, industries, and lifestyles, Thailand is confident that it can be an important strategic trade partner for China in the ASEAN region. This is because Thailand has a geographical advantage as the centre of the Greater Mekong Subregion and ASEAN, and can serve as a hub for trade, investment, and logistics in the ASEAN region. Therefore, if China and ASEAN have cooperation in cultural exchange, it can lead to the expansion of cultural exchange at the youth level, and the joint development of international educational standards, truly driving social understanding between the two sides,\" said Mr. Krisda.\nADVERTISEMENT\nMs. Woraphanit Ruayrungruang, CEO of International Business, Reignwood Group, revealed that the East-West Cultural Exchange Center, situated at Reignwood Park, the world-class community for multigenerational living on Lam Luk Ka Road, Khlong 11, Pathum Thani, was officially inaugurated on 18 May 2023, and has been a significant venue for continuous cultural exchange activities.\nCelebrating its one-year anniversary, the Reignwood Cultural Foundation hosted the \"Exploring the Future through Cultural Heritage Transmission\" event, titled \"Museums Devoted to Education and Research.\" The objective is to promote the restoration and utilisation of ancient Chinese cultural relics, facilitating cultural exchanges between Chinese and Thai youth.\nHighlights of the event include showcasing young people's interests and hobbies to deepen their understanding of traditional Chinese and Thai cultures. Selected artworks and works related to China-Thailand cultural exchanges will be showcased, and certificates of recognition will be awarded to \"Reignwood Global Little Ambassadors.\"\nFuture plans include promoting economic, trade, and cultural exchanges between China and Thailand, strengthening cooperation with local governments and organisations, and expanding cooperation projects in various sectors.\nMs. Lu Zhan, Secretary-General of Reignwood Cultural Foundation, announced the special programme \"Reignwood Global Young Ambassadors\" which aims to select and train talented Thai-Chinese youth to become ambassadors promoting friendship between the two countries.

Mr Macron was the first EU leader to visit Thailand.\u2009(Photo: AFP)\nIn April 2022, Thailand learned that French President Emmanuel Macron was keen to engage with the Asia-Pacific region in person. As the host of the 32nd Asia-Pacific Economic Leaders' Meeting (Apec) in October of that year, former deputy prime minister and foreign minister Don Pramudwinai quickly issued an invitation to the president to attend as a guest. The rest, as they say, is history.\nMr Macron visited Bangkok and attended the Apec meeting, the first EU leader to do so -- making headline news. It was a highly successful summit despite the absence of US President Joe Biden. During the trip, as a non-Apec member but the leader of a leading economic and political power, the French president was able to highlight France's regional and global economic role in the Indo-Pacific. He also met with Apec leaders on the sidelines of the event.\nMost importantly, he won the hearts and minds of Thais by choosing to roam Bangkok's streets and watch Muay Thai just like an ordinary visitor. His demeanour over here was extraordinary, and he subsequently laid down additional distinctive pillars for the two countries to diversify and deepen their three centuries-old bilateral ties. Now, both soft power and hard power have become top priorities in the Thai-French friendship.\nADVERTISEMENT\nFrance was the first European country to come out with an Indo-Pacific strategy back in 2018. Its involvement and consequences during the colonial period in Indochina and the Pacific are well documented. Today, France takes up a different role. The republic wants to approach familiar turf with a new attitude and spirit -- a mutually beneficial relationship encompassing all aspects. Notably, France is the only Western country with its own Indo-Pacific strategy that still maintains amiable ties with China. Chinese President Xi Jinping visited Paris in early May.\nSince leaving Bangkok, Mr Macron has been active in global politics, especially in the Ukraine-Russia war, strengthening Nato and EU solidarity and promoting France's Indo-Pacific strategy. As one of the EU's most powerful leaders, his opinions cannot be ignored as they are indicative of international political trends. It, therefore, follows that Thai policymakers, both in the security and economic fields, are determined to bolster their cooperation with France. Today, within Europe, France has the best ties with Thailand. In fact, Thailand wants to establish a strategic partnership with France. However, Paris is still vetting this proposal as it intends to increase strategic engagement with Bangkok, such as cooperation in military education, training and exercise, and cyber and space.\nRELATED\nopinion\nRegional antidotes to counter Trump\nopinion\nAdvancing Asean\nIn Paris on Thursday, Mr Macron will host a lunch for Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin during the Thai PM's six-hour stopover (afterwards, Mr Srettha travels to Rome). These active diplomatic moves between Thai and French leaders are unprecedented both in scope and substance. Travelling with Mr Srettha will be a powerful group of Thai business leaders from corporate giants such as Charoen Pokphand and others.\nGeneral Songwit Noonpakdee, Chief of Defence Forces, will be part of Mr Srettha's delegation but will arrive earlier to lead a group of Thai defence companies to meet their French counterparts. Obviously, France would like to see some defence cooperation between the two countries including arms procurements in addition to commercial aircraft. The Thai Defence Industry and Energy Centre and the French General Directorate for Armaments will also sign a letter of intent to promote their defence sectors.\nIn addition, three MoUs will be signed during the stopover. The first is between CP Foods and Schneider Electric on a strategic partnership on top-tier automation and software solutions. It has the potential to expand energy management for the two countries.\nThe second MoU between state satellite agency Geo-Informatics and Space Technology Development Agency and Starburst Aerospace, a leading aerospace and defence startup accelerator and strategic advisory practice, covers space capability in the future.\nThe third MoU between CP International and Airbus, which is currently being finalised, will focus on the production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) by using feedstock waste, as well as building strong cooperation around logistics optimisation, both on land and in the air, which has great potential for strengthening cooperation between Thailand and France in the areas of energy and logistics.\nAs far as soft power is concerned, at the recent High-Level Economic Dialogue in Paris, both sides agreed to promote soft power in cosmetics, perfume, textiles and fashion lines, especially Thai silk, and in health tourism. Furthermore, they exchanged views on their countries' experience with the bio-circular-green economic model. Last month, Benedicte Epinay, director and CEO of Comite Colbert, was here to exchange knowledge on the branding of luxury goods.\nThe most interesting features of Thai-French relations are the common positions they hold on key international issues -- the Ukraine-Russia war, the Middle East conflict, the Myanmar situation and the climate crisis. Both countries support the initiatives that would end the war in Ukraine. They will also attend the upcoming Peace Conference on Ukraine to be held in Switzerland June 15-16, to which Thailand has been invited.\nThailand and France are on the same page over the Middle East as they endorse the international community's call to de-escalate the Hamas-Israel conflict. Together, they have also appealed for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire and unconditional release of all hostages in the Gaza Strip, including French and Thai hostages. On the situation in Myanmar, they want peace in the country. As a member of the UN Security Council, Thailand hopes that France will support the efforts by Thailand and Asean to provide humanitarian assistance to Myanmar as well as the ongoing implementation of the peace process. Above all, Thailand and France wish to see an end to the current fighting and the start of dialogue.\nDespite pressing domestic issues, both countries are working closely together to boost bilateral ties to a new level. This has been done at the leadership level, and now Mr Srettha is about to make his second visit to France in six months. After the EU normalised ties with Thailand in 2019, France has done the most to reach out to Bangkok. Since then, ties with France have gained greater significance vis-a-vis other Western friends and allies.\nFrance has adopted a new perspective on Thailand after a newly elected government. Paris is pivoting its Indo-China strategy on Bangkok due to its geo-strategic assets and as a hub of connectivity. Both countries also want to maintain their strategic autonomy when engaging with external partners. Together, their profiles in the region could be further ramped up as France is also considered a great power with influence in global affairs.\nKavi Chongkittavorn\nA veteran journalist on regional affairs\nKavi Chongkittavorn is a veteran journalist on regional affairs\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat factor most influences your decision to choose a hotel or resort?\nPrice and discounts\nHotel reviews and ratings\nProximity to attractions\nHotel loyalty programs (e.g., points, rewards)\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nKavi Chongkittavorn\nThailand\nFrance\nDo you like the content of this article?\n15\n42\nCOMMENT\n(1)",

(Photo: Bloomberg)\nNow the new cabinet line-up has been settled, tourism operators are calling for greater unity between each ministry and related authorities to continue with the plan of making Thailand a tourism and aviation hub.\nSanga Ruangwattanakul, president of the Khao San Road Business Association, said the cabinet reshuffle would not disrupt the government's stability, as long as its flagship policies continue, particularly the the 2030 Ignite Thailand vision, which aims to elevate the status of Thailand in the fields of tourism and aviation.\nUnder the cabinet reshuffle, the culture minister and tourism minister will switch roles. Culture Minister Sermsak Pongpanich will become the tourism minister, replacing Sudawan Wangsuphakijkosol, who will take over from Mr Sermsak at the Culture Ministry. Mr Sanga said that while Mr Sermsak is not recognised for having experience in the tourism industry, his previous experience as a minister in several other ministries ought to be useful in his new role.\nADVERTISEMENT\nHowever, Mr Sanga said the new minister should recruit tourism experts as his consultants and as members of his working team.\nIn response to the sudden resignation of Parnpree Bahiddha-Nukara from the role of foreign minister, Mr Sanga said Mr Parnpree had set a high standard for significant policies, such as the permanent visa exemption scheme between Thailand and China, and extending the period of the visa-free stay for Russian tourists.\nRELATED\nthailand\nGovt approves big BMA debt fufilment budget\nthailand\nGovernment willing to explain agreement's benefits\n\"The new foreign minister is expected to work harder for unfinished missions, such as discussing visa-free entry for Thais with European nations, and pushing for seamless tourism in Southeast Asia by positioning Thailand as a hub,\" said Mr Sanga.\nTo strengthen small and medium-sized tourism operators \u2013 the largest revenue contributors for the tourism industry \u2013 Mr Sanga said the new Finance Minister Pichai Chunhavajira should work more coherently with the Bank of Thailand to solve certain ongoing issues, such as a reduction in interest rates.\nHe suggested the finance minister would regain public confidence by settling all disputes with internal agencies, instead of openly criticising others when they had different viewpoints.\nThanet Supornsahasrungsi, president  of the Association of Chonburi  Tourism Federation, said all ministries should work more collaboratively  to boost Thailand's economy and tourism industry, especially between the transport, tourism and foreign ministries.\nFor example, now that Pattaya and Chonburi can help increase carrying capacity by utilising U-tapao Airport, these ministries should work together to beef up the number of flights and increase tourism demand, said Mr Thanet.\nHe said the government should attract airlines that offer potential by providing incentives such as discounts on landing fees, parking fees or fuel surcharges, and by preparing transport from airports to the city centres.\nLooking at the government's eight months in power, he said, overall, tourism operators have already benefited from the visa exemption schemes with many countries.\nHowever, in terms of long-term policies, including soft power, they have yet to provide a fruitful outcome.\nThe government should upgrade tourist safety along with convenient travel between destinations, not just delay construction as seen with Rama II Road, which has been an obstacle for tourism in Hua Hin and Cha-am, said Mr Thanet.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nIf you were to buy real estate in Thailand outside of Bangkok, which area would be your top choice?\nChiang Mai\nPhuket\nPattaya\nKhao Yai\nKoh Samui\nHua Hin\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nThailand\nTourism\nDo you like the content of this article?\n4\n57\nCOMMENT\n(20)",

Other artists include Bible, Jes, Tong, Barcode, Nodt, Job and 2J.\n\"KinnPorsche The Series was the first Thai series to become popular globally as the production house partnered with iQiyi, China's leading on-demand video streaming service,\" said Krisda Witthayakhajorndet, founder and chief executive of Be On Cloud.\nRELATED\nbusiness\nTrump tests ethical boundaries with branded merch\nbusiness\nTrends drive job openings\n\"As a result, both Apo and Mile became brand ambassadors for international brands such as Christian Dior, Piaget, Guerlain, Bulgari, Fendi, McLaren, Skechers and Omega, as well as local brands Srichand and Giffarine.\"\nHe was previously a concert and event organiser for more than a decade, with corporate customers under the company named Be Absolute.\nGETTING TO KNOW YOU\nThe Y Series business started as Mr Krisda got to know Mile, who was involved in a deal with a production company that was in a liquidity crunch during the pandemic.\nMr Krisda decided to buy the production company and invest in the project, which resulted in a revamped version of KinnPorsche.\nHe said the series captured a global audience thanks to the production quality and creative content, as well as collaboration with Chinese streaming giant iQiyi, resulting in popularity and revenue for the company.\nBe On Cloud relied on the business practices of foreign world-class production companies as well as Mr Krisda's experience in show business, he said.\nMore than 20,000 tickets sold out within 10 minutes for a concert featuring the series' stars at Impact Muang Thong Thani following the series launch.\n\"This shows we have loyal fans with strong purchasing power and genuine interest in the Y Series genre,\" Mr Krisda said.\nHe said the success in producing drama series stems from a similarity to concert and event promotion.\nNO REGRETS\n\"If we put the KinnPorsche project on hold, we would have regretted it as the series made millions of fans happy,\" said Mr Krisda.\n\"These series create an opportunity for foreigners to get to know Thailand, including the culture, food and way of life. We hope this sparks interest among viewers to come visit the country, resulting in increased tourism revenue.\"\nBe On Cloud is collaborating with the Commerce Ministry to select community products to be included in the Shine series, which is expected to increase the market demand for Thai products and services.\nThai products still lack effective marketing channels compared with world-class brands, according to the ministry.\nThe company is committed to increasing the market value of both its Y Series dramas and products and services presented on screens, he said.\nThe total market value for Y Series content is roughly 2-3 billion baht per year, with higher revenue growth expected this year amid fierce competition, said Mr Krisda.\nEARLY MOVER\nThailand is benefiting from being the first player in this market, with unparalleled know-how and global recognition, he said.\nOver the past two years, Be On Cloud built on a solid foundation because of its strong fan club. The target audience is mostly young females age 18-30 who are willing to pay for many activities to show support for Y Series celebrities, said Mr Krisda.\nThe company's first-year sales were around 300 million baht, with profit of roughly 100 million baht.\nThe second year was a period of investment and business adjustment, and he said it was not profitable.\nThis year both revenue and performance are expected to improve because of an increasing number of fan clubs, platforms and sponsors, Mr Krisda said.\n\"We believe competition drives us to create even more quality work, with natural selection determining the survivor in this sector. We focus on producing Y Series that are fun and captivate the hearts of fans,\" he said.\n\"Our strength is having the flexibility to work with every artist and on every platform.

I hope there is an explanation.\u201d (Capture from TV)\nThe sight of a bewildered Chinese tourist in full Songkran regalia \u2014 floral shirt and water gun \u2014 has put the government on the defensive, as it seeks to clarify that the main water-splashing festival will take place for three days and not three weeks.\nAt the heart of the confusion has been an ambitious plan to boost tourism by telling the world that Thailand is celebrating the Maha Songkran World Water Festival from April 1-21.\nMany local residents are just as confused as foreign tourists about when and where the party is taking place. Among the latter was a Chinese man who posted a video of himself ready for action outside a Bangkok mall, only to find no one else was celebrating.\nADVERTISEMENT\nHe told his tale on the Chinese video-sharing site Douyin and it was then shared by Daka China, a Facebook page featuring stories about China. A Thai translation was provided.\nRELATED\nthailand\nLegal expert says Yingluck can\u2019t avoid prosecution\nbusiness\nThai businesses call for huge stimulus\n\u201cWho should I celebrate with?\u201d asks the tourist standing outside Terminal 21. \u201cThey say it\u2019s being held from April 1-21, but why has it not turned out as expected? I hope there\u2019s an explanation.\u201d\nSleeplessBKK, an account on the X platform, shared the video, tagged Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin and Pheu Thai leader Paetongtarn Shinawatra, and said it was an embarrassment.\nMs Paetongtarn, in her role as the country\u2019s \u201csoft power\u201d tsarina, was one of the prime movers behind the three-week Songkran idea.\nGovernment spokesman Chai Watcharonke told the\nBangkok Post\nthat while the festival lasts from April 1 to 21 across the country, activities are not being held simultaneously in every province.\nHe said the Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT) has a\ncalendar outlining the celebrations\nnationwide that will be extended across 21 days, but with the main celebrations being held from April 13-15 as usual in almost every province.\nAuthorities will improve their communication work and ensure that visitors are provided with accurate information to prevent misunderstandings, he added.\nTourism and Sports Minister Sudawan Wangsuphakijkosol admitted there had been some misunderstanding about the three-week-long Songkran festival. She said the ministry and responsible agencies would improve public relations and provide a more accurate explanation to foreign tourists who intend to visit the country for the water-splashing festival.\n\u201cAs for tourists already here in Thailand, please be patient and wait a few more days before you can play with water for Songkran,\u201d she said.\nTAT governor Thapanee Kiatphaibool expressed suspicions that the video might have been produced for content-creation purposes, and not out of genuine confusion on the part of the \u201ctourist\u201d.\nShe said the calendar for the Maha Songkran World Water Festival is widely available on all media platforms, and that it specifies that the water-splashing activities are usually held between April 11 and 15.\nThe Ministry of Tourism and Sports and the TAT announced on March 12 that the three-week Maha Songkran World Water Festival 2024 would begin on April 1 in the northern province of Chiang Mai and wrap up on April 21 in Chon Buri and Samut Prakan.\nThe main event from April 12-16, is expected to generate 4.3 million domestic trips and 510,000 foreign tourist visits.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWould you consider buying a house in a gated community or as a standalone property?\nGated community\nStandalone house\nEither, depending on location and price\nNo preference\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nSongkran\nWater splashing\nChinese tourists\nDo you like the content of this article?\n56\n353\nCOMMENT\n(75)",

(Photo: Reuters)\nHUALIEN, Taiwan - When a 7.2 magnitude earthquake hit Taiwan\u2019s scenic and largely rural east coast county of Hualien on Wednesday, local official Chang Tung-yao knew exactly what to do, having experienced a similar temblor six years before.\nWithin two hours of the quake, which struck just before 8am as people were getting ready for work, Chang said an emergency shelter was arranged at a nearby school where more than 130 residents ended up spending the night.\n\u201cJoined-up contact with government departments was key,\u201d Chang, a neighbourhood chief, the lowest level of elected official in Taiwan, told Reuters.\nADVERTISEMENT\nAds powered by\nThe\nnumber of people injured\nin the quake climbed past 1,000 on Thursday.

The county government and the local administrative office worked together to minimise the damage as much as possible,\u201d Chang said. (Story continues below)\nAn injured woman is taken for a medical check-up after being rescued from a remote area following the earthquake in Hualien, Taiwan. (Photo: Reuters)\nLots of experience\nTaiwan is no stranger to earthquakes, being located near the junction of two tectonic plates, and many are concentrated along the picturesque, mainly rural and sparsely populated east coast. The region is also a major draw for tourists with its rugged mountains, hot spring resorts and tranquil farms.\nMore than 100 people were killed in an earthquake in southern Taiwan in 2016, while a 7.3 magnitude quake killed more than 2,000 people in 1999.\nThat 1999 quake, commonly referred to as the \u201c921 quake\u201d as it hit on Sept 21, was a spur for the government to revise building codes and strengthen disaster management laws.\nSept 21 is now a designated day for Taiwan-wide disaster drills and on this day mock alert messages for disasters such as earthquake and tsunami are sent to people\u2019s mobile phones, and schools around the island stage evacuation drills.\nYet Tai Yun-fa, a structural engineer who runs Taiwan\u2019s Alfa Safe that develops quake-resistant building materials, said that while a tightening of building codes had helped better prepare the island for disaster, some developers were still cutting corners.\n\u201cThe focus when it comes to development is still the lowest price, so in that case you can\u2019t have the best quality.\u201d (Story continues below)\nTents are seen at a temporary reception centre following the earthquake in Hualien. (Photo: Reuters)\nLessons learned\nIn Hualien, Donna Wu, deputy director of the county branch of The Mustard Seed Mission, a Christian group, said the response in 2018 had been chaotic and they had learned their lesson.\n\u201cEveryone was doing the same thing. Tasks were not coordinated,\u201d she said. \u201cThis time, each group has different tasks.\u201d\nTaiwan has another compelling reason to ready its response \u2014 the potential for attack from China, which has been ramping up military and political pressure to try and force Taiwan\u2019s democratically-elected government to give in to Beijing\u2019s sovereignty claims.\nThe earthquake alert system, with its piercing alarm sounding on mobile phones, is the same one the government would use to warn of an impending Chinese air raid.\nTaiwan holds its Min\u2019an civil defence drills annually, nominally to focus on natural disasters, though last year it also covered how to respond to the aftermath&nbsp;of a Chinese attack as part of those exercises.\nTaiwan\u2019s Ministry of Digital Affairs, which only began operating in 2022 and has been leading the charge to ensure the resilience of communication networks, reported largely unaffected networks after the latest quake, especially internet services.\nTaiwanese cities and counties have rescuers on stand-by 24 hours a day, ready to respond almost at a moment\u2019s notice to disasters.\nLess than an hour after the latest quake struck, for example, the government in the southern city of Kaohsiung had mobilised its rescue teams to go to Hualien and sent them to the nearby air base in Pingtung to be flown in by the air force.\nThose teams regularly go to other disaster zones around the world, including Turkey when it was hit by a major quake last year, offering a \u201csoft power\u201d diplomacy for Taiwan whose government has close to no official diplomatic recognition despite its strong democratic credentials.\nSandra Oudkirk, the de facto US ambassador to Taiwan, praised the response in a message to the Taiwanese people carried on Facebook. \u201cTaiwan has demonstrated a successful model of disaster prevention, disaster management, and humanitarian rescue to communities around the world,\u201d she wrote.\nChip giant unscathed\nIn a related development, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC), the world\u2019s largest contract chip manufacturer, resumed work at its construction sites after pausing it for a day for inspections.\nThe quake had raised fears of disruptions to chip supply as TSMC produces a big share of the most advanced semiconductors, and its customers include Apple and the AI chip leader Nvidia.\nTSMC said its initial checks showed that safety systems at its Taiwan-based chip fabs were operating normally. Some fabs were evacuated but all personnel were safe and had returned to their workplace shortly after the quake, it said.\nTSMC said its overall tool recovery of its fabrication facilities exceeded 80% as of Thursday. New fabs such as the Fab 18 in Tainan were expected to reach full recovery later in the night.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nHow important are environmental sustainability practices (e.g., eco-friendly rooms, waste reduction) when choosing accommodation in Thailand?

        "content": "Opinion\nUS TikTok ban not the right move\nAaron Glasserman &amp; Monica Greco\nPUBLISHED : 27 Mar 2024 at 04:35\nNEWSPAPER SECTION:\nOped\nWRITER:\nAaron Glasserman &amp; Monica Greco\n&nbsp; Small\n&nbsp; Medium\n&nbsp; Large\n6\nOn March 13, the United States House of Representatives passed the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act. It is no secret that the bill takes aim at TikTok. The massively popular video-sharing platform is owned by Beijing-based ByteDance and is thus subject to the laws of the People's Republic of China and potentially to the control of the Communist Party of China (CPC), despite assurances to the contrary from company executives.\nIf the Senate approves the bill, and US President Joe Biden signs it into law (as he has said he would), ByteDance would be forced to sell TikTok to a non-Chinese company within six months or be banned from US app stores.\nThe reasoning, according to the legislation's bipartisan sponsors, which include the chair and ranking member of the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, is that TikTok undermines democracy and threatens national security by allowing China to \"surveil and influence the American public\".\nADVERTISEMENT\nTo be sure, TikTok poses risks to American users. But the app is only one small part of a much larger problem: the lack of an affirmative model of data privacy that protects privacy and civil liberties. By targeting TikTok, US policymakers are merely boosting the company's competitors while sapping momentum from the push for effective data and algorithmic transparency regulations.\nRELATED\nopinion\nDemocracy is in need of workers\nworld\nAustralia passes social media ban for under-16s\nSupporters of the bill rely on two arguments. The first is that TikTok is a propaganda machine that enables the CPC to flood the app's enormous user base with pro-China or otherwise harmful disinformation, thereby endangering US national security.\nOf course, the CPC wants to control China's global image. As the State Department put it in 2023, \"Beijing seeks to maximise the reach of biased or false pro-PRC content.\" That is why Chinese President Xi Jinping has repeatedly exhorted his country's propaganda apparatus and citizens to \"tell China's story well\".\nBut it is easy to exaggerate the effectiveness and danger of Chinese propaganda. So far, China's well-told story has fallen on deaf ears, at least in the US, where the need to counter the Chinese threat is one of the few points on which Republicans and Democrats agree. The country also has a dearth of cultural exports, with no Chinese equivalent to Japanese anime or South Korean K-pop, while enrollment in Mandarin-language courses at American universities has been dropping for years, further eroding China's soft power.\nMoreover, if China is attempting to use TikTok to enhance its image abroad, it is failing miserably. Attitudes toward China are largely and increasingly negative in many Western countries, which reflects the country's reputation as an authoritarian bully, its egregious human rights violations, and its association with the Covid-19 pandemic.\nA related concern is that China can manipulate content on TikTok, suppressing videos with anti-CPC narratives and perspectives that fail to \"tell China's story well\". In fact, this is a well-documented component of the country's media strategy: researchers at Rutgers University recently found that topics deemed politically sensitive in China were underrepresented on TikTok compared to Instagram.\nChinese propagandists could likewise spread inflammatory content to stoke grievances and sow divisions in American society, as Russia has been accused of doing in recent years. Yet the Russian case -- which involved Facebook and Twitter (now X) -- demonstrates that this problem is hardly unique to TikTok. Nor is it confined to foreign adversaries: numerous studies have shown that social media can normalise harmful behaviours and fuel hate speech, especially among adolescents. The challenge of algorithmically accelerated alienation goes beyond TikTok, and singling out the app will do little to fix it.\nThat brings us to US policymakers' second claim: TikTok provides the CPC with access to Americans' data, even when stored in the US. Data security is undoubtedly a serious concern, not least because internet users may be vulnerable to surveillance and exploitation by authoritarian regimes. But the world has no shortage of unregulated and underregulated data brokers, many of which operate openly in the US and other liberal democracies. Banning TikTok will not change the fact that private companies and state agencies alike have tremendous power to collect and store data about almost every aspect of our lives. And forcing ByteDance to divest from TikTok will simply put data collected by the app in the hands of another actor. It would be naive to assume that these actors have good intentions merely because they have no direct ties to the Chinese state.\nTreating disinformation and data insecurity as TikTok-specific problems serves the interests of rival tech companies like Meta and those who seek to weaponise national security concerns to prevent sector-wide regulation. Ironically, doing so also plays into the Chinese claim that American democracy is a sham, corrupted by corporate interests and lobbyists. What is more, it would be seen as hypocritical since the US has condemned platform bans in other countries (such as the 2021 suspension of Twitter in Nigeria), citing freedom of expression and access to information as pillars of democracy.\nThe real threat that TikTok represents is much greater and more deeply entrenched than US policymakers want to admit: the unregulated collection and trafficking of personal data in the service of private profit and state control. To solve this problem, lawmakers must work with civil society to do as many have suggested: develop an affirmative model of data privacy that guarantees civil liberties, requires algorithmic transparency, and empowers ordinary people to understand how corporate and government entities are using their data. Without these structural reforms, a TikTok ban will be little more than an empty win for a gridlocked Congress.\n\u00a92024 Project Syndicate\nAaron Glasserman, an Academy Scholar at the Harvard Academy for International and Area Studies, is a China Fellow at the Wilson Center.

(Photo: Royal Thai Army)\nFor decades, the United States' positioning in the international arena has been a battle between the desire to remain isolated within the confines of its own territory and the urge to extend beyond its boundaries to induce and cajole others on the values and benefits of democracy, freedom and a free market.\nIn the former case, many in the United States feel comfortable and secure with their lives in the land of the bountiful, knowing that they are protected by two great oceans on its coasts and neighboured in the north and south by less endowed and rather innocuous countries. In such a situation, there exists a general feeling that the United States should go about its own affairs, be content with itself and disassociate from the affairs of others, as no harm could ever come to the shores of the United States.\nOn the other hand, many Americans also believe that the United States has a moral obligation to help the world and ensure that all can live in peace and prosperity. Some in the United States even contend that the country should not be complacent and wait for challenges and threats to occur but instead be proactive in its approach towards installing the values that they hold so dear. They believe that it is better to establish a series of forward defence lines while ensuring that the United States' ships and aeroplanes could always roam freely in the high seas and skies.\nADVERTISEMENT\nAs there are arguments to be made and examples to be referenced supporting and decrying each side of the issue, it would seem wise that the superpower moves forward, taking a more central approach which does not veer towards the extreme in either direction. It would be impractical and dangerous to suggest that the United States should completely extricate itself from the geopolitical scene and take a hands-off approach to the world at large. It is just the way of the world that some situations call for global powers to intervene for the greater good. However, what type of intervention occurs should be carefully deliberated, as it is of the utmost importance that diplomacy and dialogue are balanced with the need for military intervention.\nRELATED\nworld\nTrump returns to world stage at Notre-Dame reopening\nbusiness\nKorean turmoil dents equity trading sentiment\nThe United States entered the First World War to prevent the rising imperial Germany from successfully establishing its dominance over Europe and adjacent areas. However, it then withdrew inward, as it was not ready to play the role of a global guardian by choosing to forgo participation in the League of Nations. After the Second World War, which the United States entered to oppose the global threat of German fascism, they immediately accepted such a global position, taking a forward approach to the world and leading the opposition against the expansion of communism.\nThe United States became the supreme global power after the destruction of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of the Soviet Union and its leadership of communism. The world began to embrace and accept democracy and capitalist globalisation, but there was discontentment in both the United States and the world at large that had to do with the rapidly expanding concentration of wealth and power, the inequality between the haves and have-nots and the erosion of cultural identities, traditional values, self-respect and self-confidence. All are issues that have led to anti-globalisation sentiments and movements, which are further compounded by the decades of forced regime changes and the countless atrocities that coincided with them, which were all initiated and imposed by the United States and its allies in the name of anti-communism. The United States lost many wars, not because of its military weakness, but because it lacked the understanding and appreciation of the force of nationalism and human dignity among those who interpreted the United States' purportedly well-meaning and good-intended actions as an outright immoral intervention and imposition of view. The latest episode was the humiliating departure of the United States forces from Afghanistan, which started under former president Donald Trump, whose promotion of \"America first\" and constant complaints about the security arrangement of alliances reflected his position and isolationist thinking and posturing. The current President Joe Biden offers a return to the idea of \"Manifest Destiny\", the idea of the \"white man's burden\", and the forward defence concept.\nThese two juxtapositions have once again taken over American debates, namely moving forward with a policy of isolationism or internationalism that incorporates interventionism. As the United States is a global power with corresponding interests, which the international community depends on as a guarantor of peace, security and common prosperity, its decision moving forward will have far-reaching and long-lasting consequences. Interdependency and connectivity have dictated that the international community must live and work together.\nTaking the middle path would strike a perfect balance between promoting the betterment of the world while still serving the interests of the American people. The key change, however, is that it would require the United States to stop and listen before isolating and intervening. They would be a mediator instead of acting as the global policeman. With such a change, they would still support their longtime friends and allies, but in a strategic manner instead of a militaristic one. Providing assistance in ways that go beyond helping the military would promote security throughout the world and also gain the truly genuine backing of the citizens.\nAn obvious example of where such a policy would be immediately beneficial is in Southeast Asia. China is an autocratic behemoth that has been successfully expanding its influence throughout the region and world. Instead of focusing solely on increasing its militaristic support of countries like the Philippines and Vietnam, the United States could counter China with greater soft-power support. If, for example, they helped countries in the region improve their education systems and helped build growing industries, said countries would not only potentially develop to the point of being able to counter China's influence on their own but their positive ties to the United States would actually be seen by the civilian populations, instead of only by their semi-authoritarian leaders and the military-industrial complex. If the United States were to present countries in the region a reason to move forward with them, beyond merely saying that they should not move forward with their neighbour China and supporting their militaries, they are likely to have much more success.\nThe countries that maintain a stronger position in the world share a greater responsibility and that is the reason why there is the United Nations Security Council, permanently composed of the United States, Russia, China, the United Kingdom and France. The United States thus owes a legal obligation, as well as an international mandate, to serve the world at large. That said, the United States also has an obligation to its own citizens, and thus, a careful balancing of domestic interests and international involvement must occur. In other words, the United States should take the principle of the middle path to simultaneously handle its foreign policy and its domestic policy through the strengthening of its prosperity and stability at home, as well as strengthening its friendship and cooperation with friends abroad.\nKasit Piromya\nAPHR Board Member\nKasit Piromya is a Board Member of Asean Parliamentarians for Human Rights (APHR), and is a former Thai foreign minister.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat type of condominium are you most interested in?\nStudio\n1-bedroom\n2-bedroom\n3-bedroom\nPenthouse\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nUS foreign policy\nDo you like the content of this article?\n20\n15\nCOMMENT\n(40)",

The best way to preserve the status quo is to destroy the machinery that promises a change to existing ways.\nThat was the thinking of the Luddites, a movement of textile workers in early 19th-century England. Discomfited by the trade embargoes and financial crisis of the Napoleonic wars, they smashed up powered looms and weaving frames, hoping to slow the tide of innovation they saw as undercutting their livelihoods.\nIt's an example with worrying parallels to the present. China's widening lead in clean technology, coupled with its vast trade surplus and Beijing's desire to export its way out of a domestic slump, are combining with faltering efforts on decarbonisation in developed countries to produce a toxic mix.\nADVERTISEMENT\nIf green technology such as electric vehicles, solar panels and home batteries gets badged as foreign and threatening and finds itself excluded via laws and tariff policies, then drastically falling costs aren't going to be enough to get it into the hands of consumers. Spurious national security and industrial policy concerns will be sufficient to banish it.\nRELATED\nlife\nHorror show\nworld\nVolkswagen says next generation of combustion engine cars to be its last\nWe're already seeing evidence of this on multiple continents. Local content requirements and tariff barriers on solar panels, designed to build up domestic manufacturing industries, have operated in many places (including India, the US, South Africa, and Indonesia) as soft bans that have pushed up costs, slowed deployments, and favoured incumbent fossil-fired power generation and emissions.\nThe European Union, which doesn't impose tariffs on photovoltaic imports, installed nearly twice as much solar last year as the US and more than seven times as much as India, despite weather that's far less suited for the technology.\nElectric vehicles look like being the next front in this conflict. China's shift from one of the world's biggest car importers to among its biggest exporters has troubled its trading partners. Most of the export drive to date has come from conventional automobiles, but China's innovative technological edge in EVs has put electric models in the spotlight.\nSo far, the outrage has been fairly muted. Tariffs of 25% imposed under the Trump administration mean that few Chinese vehicles appear on US roads anyway, and in Europe, they're still not a dominant presence. Nonetheless, Brussels last October announced an investigation into whether Chinese cars had benefited from unfair subsidies, and the White House last month started an inquiry into Chinese technology in \"connected vehicles\", a category that sweeps in electric cars as well as many conventional ones.\nWith European and US automakers slowing their decarbonisation targets and slumping prices for battery metals likely to push Chinese EVs well below the cost of conventional cars, the perceived threat of cheaper, cleaner, better imported automobiles will only grow.\n\"Imagine if there were thousands or hundreds of thousands of Chinese-connected vehicles on American roads that could be immediately and simultaneously disabled by somebody in Beijing,\" US Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said in February.\nThat Red Dawn scenario seems weirdly fixated on cars, when you consider about 60% of the sensor-packed mobile phones the US imported over the past decade were made in China, rising to about 90% when if you include those produced in Mexico and Southeast Asian countries that are typically used as backdoor trade routes.\nThis trajectory could grow a good deal darker if elections this year replace the centrist administrations of presidents Ursula von der Leyen in Brussels and Joe Biden in Washington with more nativist and protectionist politicians. As we've seen in Japan, South Africa and India, minor tweaks to obscure regulations can be remarkably effective at stopping clean technology in its tracks.\nThat suggests there's still scope for right-wing populists to try out more draconian anti-green legislation than the largely rhetorical opposition practised by the Trump administration and UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak.\nBoth sides of the trade conflict can do things to avert this fate.\nDeveloped countries need to clear red tape standing in the way of their ambitious decarbonisation plans and offer further support for green technology demand. Manufacturers quite reasonably suspect that decarbonisation targets will be abandoned when the going gets tough, so don't invest as aggressively as Chinese competitors, convinced they have the state's backing. The result is ever-growing Chinese dominance.\nThey also need to remember that what they have right now is not energy security. Ms Raimondo's nightmare vision of foreign authoritarians playing havoc with transport networks doesn't need secret kill switches.\nPetroleum exporters already have enough sway in energy markets to raise costs on industries and households to devastating levels. Beijing can't stop the sun from shining on Chinese-made solar panels in Germany -- but Moscow really did cut the flow of gas to Europe.\nChina, for its part, needs to recognise that it can't export its way out of its current economic troubles -- and that attempts to do so will only accelerate the protectionist currents growing stronger by the day in its trading partners. A push toward more household consumption, rather than another export boom, is the best way to rebalance its economy.\nTo confront the common global challenge of a warming planet, every part of the world needs to work in unison. An acceleration in trade wars will only slow our path to zero.\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg\nDavid Fickling is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering energy and commodities.

Tourism is one of the flagship policies,'' said Mr Srettha, who also serves as finance minister.\nThe government is improving the ease of travel for foreign tourists, with examples being the temporary visa exemptions granted to visitors from India, Russia, Kazakhstan, and Taiwan, he said.\nAs part of such efforts, Thailand and China also signed a reciprocal visa exemption agreement, which came into effect on March 1.\nThe government is likewise pushing to reach visa-free travel arrangement deals with European states in the Schengen area.\n\"The visa-free travel deal with the Schengen states is not just a dream,\" the prime minister said.\nMr Srettha also stressed the need to improve infrastructure and upgrade immigration control systems to prepare for international visitors.\n\"We have to make sure they are impressed from the moment they set foot in Thailand until they leave the country,\" he said.\nThe prime minister also said that during his recent trip to Germany and France, he met with Formula E executives who expressed interest in Thailand as a potential site for hosting a Formula E electric-car racing championship series.\nHe said Formula E executives would come to explore an area in Chiang Mai next week to study the feasibility of holding a Formula E competition in Thailand for the first time. That would help promote Thailand as a regional tourism hub, he said.\nFormula E is officially known as the ABB FIA Formula E World Championship. It was launched in Beijing in 2014 and later earned the FIA world championship status.\nThe premier previously said Thailand was making a shift towards using EV cars, with them accounting for 40% of total car orders made since the end of last year.\nMr Srettha said the government is making the most of Thailand's cultural heritage or \"soft power\".\n\"This brainstorming session will not end up like a firework fizzling out. It should be used as a platform for a further push for tourism alongside infrastructure development. Next year will be the biggest year for tourism, but we will have to begin later this year. But first, we also need six months to prepare,\" Mr Srettha said.\n\"Thailand will host cultural and sports events, concerts, Formula E, world food festivals and much more,\" he said.\nMr Srettha also said the government is working with retail business operators from Central Group, Siam Piwat, the Mall Group and King Power to promote products made by local communities under an initiative called \"Thainess Station: Thai Products Unify Thai Communities\".\nThai handicrafts, including pha khao ma or Thai loincloth, basketry from kra jood or bulrush and indigo-dyed fabric are now being sold at shopping malls like IconSiam and King Power's retail outlets at all Thai international airports until April 30.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat is your budget range for renting a condominium?\nUnder 10,000 THB/month\n10,000 - 20,000 THB/month\n20,000 - 40,000 THB/month\n40,000 - 60,000 THB/month\nOver 60,000 THB/month\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nThailand\nTourism\nTravel\nTrip\nDo you like the content of this article?\n5\n81\nCOMMENT\n(14)",

(Reuters photo)\nThe Philippines is counting on the US and its allies to play a crucial role in its plans to explore energy resources in the disputed South China Sea, according to Manila\u2019s envoy to Washington.\nThe country is seeking to parlay its deepening security ties with Washington into broader economic benefits, said Philippine Ambassador to the US Jose Manuel Romualdez.&nbsp;\n\u201cWhen the time comes that we are going to start exploring it, we\u2019ll have the options to be able to see how we can secure the expedition,\u201d Romualdez said in an interview in Manila. \u201cWe\u2019re working closely with our allies, not only the US but also Japan and Australia,\u201d he said.\nADVERTISEMENT\nAds powered by\nThe Philippines is exploring several options in its quest to tap the resource-rich South China Sea, waters that China claims almost in its entirety. The body of water is estimated to hold significant quantities of oil and gas, according to the US Energy Information Administration.\nRELATED\nproperty\nThai luxury properties dominate in Asia\nbusiness\nDriving regional growth: UOB\u2019s vision for Thailand\nInviting US companies to invest in the exploration as well as development efforts and discussions with countries like Vietnam that also have overlapping claims with China are among the possible courses of action, he said on March 5.&nbsp;\nThe Philippines imports almost all its fuel needs and has been trying for years to start energy exploration in the disputed waters, including through a partnership with China. Negotiations between Manila and Beijing have, however, stalled amid heightened tensions, with their coast guard vessels recently clashing again at sea.\nAmid its spat with China, the Southeast Asian nation is enforcing a new strategy to defend its territory and economic interests. It has also recently inked several security deals with countries like the UK, Australia and Canada.\nCalculated way\nNow the Philippines and its allies are \u201cmoving in a calculated way\", the envoy said, declining to provide more details on the energy plan, except to say that it will likely happen within President Ferdinand Marcos Jr\u2019s term ending in 2028. \u201cIt\u2019s part of our energy package,\u201d he said, referring to a broad strategy to bring power costs \u2014 among the highest in the region \u2014 lower to attract investors.\nAs the Philippines builds its security alliances amid tensions with Beijing, it wants these partnerships to yield more trade and investment, said Romualdez. \u201cWhile we have all these defence ties, the bottom line is economic prosperity. If we do not have economic security, we can have all these defence agreements and it would mean nothing to us,\u201d the envoy, a cousin of Marcos, said.\nChina is also keen on reaping benefits from the resource-rich waters. President Xi Jinping has called on the military to align its maritime strategy with economic development, in what may further intensify its dispute with the Philippines.\nIn a wide-ranging interview ahead of the US trade and investment mission this week, Romualdez said Marcos is trying to leverage his rising influence on the global stage to win deals for the country. Over the past year, Marcos has deepened security ties with the US. The Philippine leader last month addressed the Australian parliament and in May will be the keynote speaker at regional security forum.&nbsp;\nMarcos is scheduled to meet with US Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo on Monday before he heads to Germany for meetings with Chancellor Olaf Scholz, alongside other Southeast Asian leaders.\n\u201cPresident Marcos is very, very keen on trying to catch these investment opportunities open to us now because we\u2019re in the center,\u201d Romualdez said. Even European countries are taking interest, he added.\nRaimondo will lead a delegation to Manila that also includes about 20 American executives from Microsoft Corp, United Airlines Holdings Inc, Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google and some energy firms, aiming to strengthen economic relations and spur investment into an increasingly important ally. Raimondo will then proceed to Thailand, in hopes of boosting ties in areas including supply chain diversification.\nWhile the Philippines\u2019 strong relations with the US is an advantage, competition for investment among Southeast Asian nations is intense. Marcos has to prove that his government can provide a conducive business environment including less red tape and lower electricity costs, the envoy said.\nHigh power costs remain one of the biggest hurdles for investors, according to Romualdez, and is one of the incentives driving the Philippines\u2019 push to explore its own energy resources.\nMarcos\u2019s defence chief earlier this year said that it\u2019s increasingly urgent for the Philippines to pursue resource exploration in contested waters, as a key gas field nears depletion.\nLast month, the nation\u2019s foreign affairs secretary signalled openness to energy talks with Beijing, while maintaining that Manila would not yield control of any venture to China.\nFor Philippine Ambassador Romualdez, the time for being soft with Beijing is over.&nbsp;\n\u201cWhat is ours is ours, and we\u2019re not going to stop,\u201d he said of the nation\u2019s plans to explore resources in its exclusive economic zone. \u201cWe\u2019ll do it when we feel like it\u2019s time for us to do it,\u201d he said.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat type of building do you prefer for a condominium?\nHigh-rise (more than 10 floors)\nMid-rise (5-10 floors)\nLow-rise (less than 5 floors)\nNo preference\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nPhilippines\nChina\nSouth china sea\nUs\nOil\nGas\nDo you like the content of this article?\n22\n13\nCOMMENT\n(15)",

Most of this group was in the Bangkok metropolitan area and tended to buy pricey, non-food items such as electrical appliances, he said.\nADVERTISEMENT\nConsumers are awaiting additional stimulus measures or government spending to lift their confidence in making purchases, he said.\nMr Chatchai said he expects the retail segment to accelerate in the third quarter as budget spending gears up, contributing to overall retail growth of 3% in 2024, aligning with the GDP growth forecast.\nRELATED\nbusiness\nSET eases from 1,500 as momentum slows\nthailand\nRattan Meets Watchmaking: Art Transforms Luxury Retail\nHowever, he said some issues continue to hamper the sector and its supply chain, such as a high non-performing loan outlook and rising living costs, which drag down consumer spending power, especially among the middle and low-income classes.\nThe non-food segment is expected to grow slower than the food segment, given higher prices and larger purchases, coupled with the former being non-essential purchases, according to the association.\nAlthough there are 8-10 million consumers in the upper middle class with strong spending power, they might not spend as much as expected unless the government regains their confidence through investment and incentives, said Mr Chatchai.\n\"The government continues to push large-scale development projects like the Land Bridge and high-speed railway connecting three airports, but there has been no tangible outcome thus far that would revive consumer confidence in higher spending,\" he said.\nTourists shop at Siam Paragon mall in Bangkok. Kasikorn Research Center estimates Thai retail sales in 2024 to expand by 3% to 4.1 trillion baht.\u2009Wichan Charoenkiatpakul\nSPENDING BOOST\nMr Chatchai suggested short-term initiatives to drive high-spending consumers, such as transforming Phuket into a tax-free shopping destination to attract high-value buyers. This segment would be more likely to buy local, especially if a domestic tourism incentive was offered, he said.\nTo enhance foreign tourist spending, the focus should be on prolonged stays and developing high-quality products, said Mr Chatchai. Leveraging soft power policies, such as promoting festivals and local culture, serve as positive examples to increase expenditure.\nRegarding the influx of cheap Chinese goods, he said this phenomenon emerged many years ago with globalisation and should not affect the retail sector as significantly as the industrial and manufacturing sectors because retail is at the end of the supply chain.\nGiven fast-paced technology and shorter product life cycles, consumers naturally gravitate towards affordable products, be it electrical appliances or clothing, said Mr Chatchai.\nTo strengthen the nation's manufacturing supply chain and enhance competitiveness, he suggested the government consider regulating free trade zones and reassess value-added tax (VAT) exemptions for online purchases of less than 1,500 baht to deter the influx of illegal, low-cost foreign goods.\nTax and tariff waivers are major factors contributing to the wave of Chinese products entering the country, said Mr Chatchai.\nThailand waived the import duty and VAT on imported parcels with combined price and cost, insurance and freight fees of no more than 1,500 baht per piece. The price was set at 1,000 baht in 2018 before the recent hike.\nEvery year more than 30 million parcels are shipped into Thailand, of which half importers claim the item price is lower than 1,500 baht.\nAccording to the Federation of Thai Industries, up to 20 industrial sectors, including steel, aluminium, plastics, ceramics, petrochemicals and medicine, are struggling to deal with tougher competition, with small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) the most affected.\nSanan Angubolkul, chairman of the Thai Chamber of Commerce, said China is a major global manufacturing hub with ample raw materials and developed supply chains, leading to low production costs and cheaper products. Coupled with the boom in e-commerce, an influx of cheap Chinese products is flooding the Thai market, he said.\n\"Companies have expressed concern regarding this influx into both Thai and Southeast Asian markets as it further compounds the challenges faced by local SMEs,\" said Mr Sanan.\nHe said certain imported products such as electrical appliances could cause problems because they may lack certification based on Thai industrial standards. Insufficient staff to carry out rigorous inspections also creates a challenge when handling a large volume of imports, said Mr Sanan.\nConsumers walk past decorations for Chinese New Year at CentralWorld mall on Feb 7, 2024.\u2009Pattarapong Chatpattarasill\nWARNING ISSUED\nKasikorn Research Center (K-Research) forecast retail sales to expand by 3% this year to 4.1 trillion baht.\nAccording to the research unit, consumer product retail sales grew by 5% in 2023, 7% in 2022 and 1.3% in 2021, after contracting 0.6% in 2020. In 2019, the market grew 4.6%.\nGrowth this year is expected to be driven largely by foreign tourist spending and higher prices for certain items, particularly food and personal goods, noted the think tank.\nHowever, K-Research warned local manufacturers will likely face intense competition from imported goods, especially from China.\nLast year Thailand imported consumer goods worth 470 billion baht from China, up 2.8% year-on-year, accounting for 41% of total imported consumer goods.\nChinese imports include both daily necessities and electrical appliances, constituting 43.3% of the value of consumer goods imported from China, followed by fresh and processed fruit and vegetables (10%), clothing and footwear (9.3%) and household appliances and decorations at (9.1%).\nAccording to K-Research, Chinese consumer goods pressure the competitiveness of Thai manufacturers, especially for fashion items (shoes and bags), and fresh and processed fruit and vegetables.\nThe influx of Chinese products has diminished the production capacity of non-food consumer goods, said the think tank, particularly for fashion (shoes, clothing and accessories) and furniture, where the production capacity utilisation rate is at 30-45%.\nK-Research concluded the flood of imported Chinese goods presents a significant challenge for Thai manufacturers.\nConsumers select canned food at a Big C hypermarket in Bangkok. Consumers are currently awaiting additional stimulus measures or government spending to boost their confidence in making purchases, Mr Chatchai said. Nutthawat Wicheanbut\nFOOD HIT HARD\nThaniwan Kulmongkol, president of the Thai Restaurant Association, said the influx of cheap food ingredients from China also disrupted the domestic market, posing a threat to the competitiveness of local farmers.\nMs Thaniwan said the majority of Chinese imports consist of agricultural products, particularly vegetables and fruit such as grapes, red onions and garlic.\nFor instance, imported garlic costs around 40 baht per kilogramme, significantly lower than garlic from Si Sa Ket, a major Thai production area, which is priced 150-200 baht per kg.\nThis price difference has reduced the supply of locally grown produce, making Thai farmers less competitive, she said.\nSmall restaurants and street food vendors tend to rely on cheaper ingredients to manage costs, while larger restaurants and chain operators can afford to use authentic, higher-quality ingredients to maintain their service standards.\nMs Thaniwan emphasised the need for more coordinated efforts among responsible ministries to support the entire agricultural supply chain, from upstream production and sourcing to downstream selling and exports.\n\"As the government aims to elevate Thai cuisine as a soft power globally, it should focus on supporting the production of authentic ingredients,\" she said.\nMs Thaniwan cited the Tourism Authority of Thailand's World Kaphrao Thailand Grand Prix, where contestants are required to use local ingredients such as sweet basil and jasmine rice, as a good example. Such an event can promote this famous dish and increase exports of Thai ingredients worldwide, she said.\nKey Thai products can still compete in terms of quality and pricing for both export and domestic consumption, such as jasmine rice, raw chicken, shrimp and canned fish, said Ms Thaniwan.\nShe said the restaurant industry expects steady revenue growth this year as foreign tourist arrivals increase, forecast to reach 35-40 million this year.\nMs Thaniwan said foreign tourists still perceive Thailand as an affordable destination with a diverse array of food, ranging from street food to Michelin-recognised establishments.\nConversely, as domestic purchasing power weakens, locals may choose more affordable meals or street food to manage expenses, she said.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat type of house are you most interested in?\nSingle-family home\nTownhouse\nSemi-detached house\nVilla\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nRetail\nSector\nChina\nCheap\nProducts\nLiving\nCosts\nImport\nDo you like the content of this article?\n11\n15\nCOMMENT\n(4)",

(Photo: Chanat Katanyu)\nPrime Minister Srettha Thavisin announced his vision for Thailand's future recently. Dubbed \"Ignite Thailand\", the plan seeks to establish the country as the world-class hub for eight sectors, namely tourism, medical and wellness tourism, food and agriculture, aviation, logistics, future mobility, digital economy, as well as finance.\nThe vision was lauded by economic analysts, who said the government should continue to develop the nation's potential, and the plan could lead the way towards a more sustainable way out of the current economic slump.\nAccording to Nonarit Bisonyabut, senior economic researcher at Thailand Development Research Institute (TDRI), developing the country into a regional hub for businesses and industries can help Thailand escape the middle-income trap.\nADVERTISEMENT\n\"Thailand should find a way to general revenues in a more sustainable manner, as the country's main problem is low economic growth,\" he said.\nRELATED\nlife\nIgnite your curiosity at Singapore Writers Festival\nbusiness\nPundits evaluate affiliate marketing tie-up\nSET PRIORITIES\nHe urged state agencies to identify which areas need urgent attention, so officials can focus their efforts on the problems and direct resources more effectively.\n\"The budget for soft power promotion, for instance, will never be enough, as long as the government spends it only on organising events,\" he explained, urging the government to spend its budget more wisely.\nFor instance, the government might want to consider sparing part of the 500-billion-baht budget for the digital wallet scheme to help address some of the structural issues within the economy.\n\"If the government wants to promote the country as the logistic hub, it should forget the Land Bridge megaproject. It would save up several billion baht, which could be used to solve border issues and address weaknesses in our regulations,\" he added.\n\"We are already number 1 in the region in terms of tourism. As a wellness and medical hub, we are also price-competitive with Singapore, especially in surgery and childbirth.\n\"With our rich food culture and our status as a food exporter, Thailand could very well become a regional hub for agriculture and food -- we just need to focus on maintaining the quality,\" he said.\nPROBLEMS AND POTENTIAL\nThe researcher, however, pointed out the challenges faced by the other five industries.\nMr Nonarit said the opportunity to develop the country's potential as an aviation hub is gradually narrowing because of the stiff competition in the region.\nThe government planned to develop aircraft maintenance depots in U-tapao and Chiang Rai-Mae Fah Luang airports, but construction has been beset by delays since the Covid-19 pandemic.\nThailand is well-positioned to be a logistics hub because of its location at the centre of the Cambodia-Laos-Myanmar-Vietnam region, which is expected to grow rapidly in the next few years, but plans for a cross-country connection would only be viable as long as they linked to either India or China on one end.\n\"If we can connect to India and southern China, it would be a great advantage because there is a lot of demand,\" he said.\nHowever, the government is choosing to go with the Land Bridge mega-project, which Mr Nonarit said won't significantly reduce transit times like the Panama Canal and Egypt's Suez Canal.\nThailand also has the potential to become the future hub for foreign investment, he said, especially as China is facing numerous geopolitical problems.\nIn order to become a digital economy hub, the government should ask itself, whether or not it is ready to develop the country into a digital special economic zone, and really focus on start-up businesses.\nWhile it is impossible for Thailand to compete with Hong Kong and Singapore as a global financial hub in the next couple of years, the country can still be a hub for regional investments, especially for companies and projects based in the CLMV region, he said.\nGiven those limitations, he urged the government to concentrate on its areas of expertise, namely tourism and food.\nNonarit: Govt needs to focus\nIsares Rattanadilok Na Phuket, vice-chairman of the Federation of Thai Industries (FTI), said he was delighted to hear the government is finally concentrating on the key issue affecting the country.\n\"I want to see the government work with the private sector, the way the Joint Public and Private Sector Consultative Committee (JPPSCC) did, to ensure every effort goes in the same direction,\" said Mr Isares.\nIf the government has set a clear direction, the private sector will then be able to help the country to compete with its neighbouring countries, Mr Isares said. \"I think the government is starting to see the country must have better infrastructure to accommodate both tourists and advanced industries,\" he said.\nImprovements to the country's railway system can improve connections to Laos via Thanaleng railway station, and onwards to southern China and beyond. However, private companies are often deterred from investing due to the abundance of red-tape. As such, he urged the government ease the regulations to facilitate private sector involvement. \"The advantage of this government is that the prime minister came from the private sector, so he understands what it wants,\" he added.\nIsares: Time to set clear goals\nThe Dream\nOn the other hand, Varakorn Samakoses, economic and finance expert and president of Dhurakij Pundit University, disagreed with the hub development plan saying the concept of hubs is old-fashioned.\nThe hub development plan has been talked about for a long time, he said, adding the world today is more advanced than that. \"It might be the dream of the premier alone. I think the government should focus on short-term policies that are more suited to more current problems, before committing to hub development processes for another 20\u201330 years,\" said Mr Varakorn. \"The premier has a dream that he wants to make true, but his method is not based on reality. We barely hear other countries talk about hubs in this era.\"\nThailand, he said, has a lot of short-term problems that need to be fixed, that's why the government should review the plan to develop the eight hubs to see if it still lines up with the national development strategy. \"However, in these 2\u20133 years, the most important is to learn how to spend the budget efficiently and boost the quality of human resources,\" Mr Varakorn added.\nVarakorn: Hub dream outdated\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat type of accommodation do you usually prefer when traveling in Thailand?\nLuxury hotels (5-star)\nMid-range hotels (3-4 star)\nHostels and guesthouses\nPrivate rentals (Airbnb or villas)\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nIgnite\nThailand\nSrettha\nVision\nHub\nDo you like the content of this article?\n12\n65\nCOMMENT\n(56)",

Being held under the theme of \u201cChicNature,\u201d the event will cover lifestyle products such as furniture, gifts, home d\u00e9cor, tableware, kitchenware, toys, spa products, fashion, fabrics, leather goods, as well as new materials sectors, including products for the hospitality industry and various projects. The event targets buyers from potential markets around the globe, such as China, Japan, the United States, South Asia, the Middle East, Europe, and ASEAN.\nThe DITP Director General stated: \u201cThe development of lifestyle and fashion products is crucial in line with the Government\u2019s policy, welding Thailand's soft power to enhance the country\u2019s competitiveness on the world market. Thai exports of lifestyle and fashion products have been internationally recognised for their quality, craftsmanship, diverse raw materials, and uniquely Thai designs. In 2024, export revenues of the industry are expected to exceed 323 billion baht.\u201d\nADVERTISEMENT\nHe added: \u201cFurthermore, the lifestyle product and fashion industry play a vital role in driving the country\u2019s economy, with over 90% of entrepreneurs being SMEs employing over 2 million people in the supply chain. DITP, in collaboration with the Board of Trade of Thailand, thus constantly organises events to accelerate export volumes and create added value. DITP has instructed our 58 overseas trade offices worldwide to invite buyers, importers, real estate business groups, hotel groups, and major business projects to visit the event. Besides, we have prepared a long list of highlighted products customised to meet the diverse tastes and requirements of importers and buyers.\u201d\nRELATED\nthailand\nTariffs likely if Trump wins, warn experts\nbusiness\nMinister courts British investors\nMr. Sanan Angubolkul, Chairman of the Board of Trade of Thailand, meanwhile remarked: \u201cSTYLE Bangkok 2024 is a meeting place for Thai entrepreneurs aiming for development under the sustainability concept and with the goal of promoting environmental, social, and governance (ESG) values.\n\u201cAll of us at the Board of Trade of Thailand and DITP are confident that STYLE Bangkok 2024 will serve Thai entrepreneurs well in negotiating trades with key partners from around the world, adding value to the exports of lifestyle and fashion products, and thereby driving the national economy. The Board of Trade of Thailand has supported STYLE Bangkok in all aspects \u2013 promoting the network of participants, developing online registration systems, organising event promotion, and making the event more attractive to entrepreneurs, designers, startups, community enterprises nationwide, as well as exporters and international traders,\u201d Mr. Sanan reiterated.\nSTYLE Bangkok is undoubtedly the most important international trade platform for lifestyle and fashion products in Thailand, representing a key strategy for the development and promotion of proactive international trade by DITP. The event provides ample opportunities for SMEs at all levels, as well as Thai designers, to negotiate trade and establish partnerships with global buyers. This year's main theme, \u201cChicNature,\u201d will be reflected in the merchandise of all categories - lifestyle, fashion, and crafted designs tailored to meet individual lifestyle needs. Crucially, STYLE Bangkok also serves to inspire and deepen awareness about sustainable business practices.\n\u201cSTYLE Bangkok 2024 targets over 490 companies in 820 booths and anticipates no fewer than 30,000 visitors,\u201d revealed Mr. Phusit.

After eight years of operation, the visual effects business stabilised and YGG expanded into the animation business by capitalising on its expertise, chief executive Tanat Juwiwat told the Bangkok Post.\nGAME ON\nADVERTISEMENT\nAs the company grew, it entered the game market with the launch of Home Sweet Home, based on Thai myths and beliefs, aiming to tap the growing global market.\nEntering the gaming market enabled YGG to expand its business beyond offering outsourcing services to have its own intellectual property in the global market, said Mr Tanat.\nRELATED\nbusiness\nSET lists stocks for marginal accounts\nbusiness\nMACO reports demand uptick for rights offering\nHe said the company did not solely focus on following gaming trends when developing its flagship hit, but rather blending unique Thai culture into the game.\nMr Tanat said it is easier to develop video games now compared with years ago thanks to the availability of advanced game engines.\nAs a gamer himself, he said he dreamt of developing games for others to play because he knew what gamers needed. Mr Tanat said YGG's key to success is differentiating games from other developers, rather than just following trends.\nThe company developed Home Sweet Home with the concept of creating a \"universe\", meaning the game has a series of new episodes and the format will evolve in line with changing technology, he said.\nThe game is available on Windows, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and virtual reality devices.\n\"The company's key to success is differentiating games from other developers, rather than just following trends, blending unique Thai culture into its game.\" -- Tanat Juwiwat, Chief Executive, Yggdrazil Group\n\"We have 1 million gamers aged 18-35 playing the game. We always explore modern technology, including artificial intelligence, which will help us cut production costs and speedily deliver products to market,\" Mr Tanat said.\nSince 2017, the game has earned positive reviews from streamers, he said. As the company combats copyright violations, it keeps updating new features in the game, and gamers have supported authentic games, said Mr Tanat.\nLater on, the illegal games stopped violating its copyright, he said.\nMr Tanat said the company's listing on the Market for Alternative Investment in 2020 reflected its capability and the potential of its team to make inroads into the global market.\n\"We are the first digital art company to list on the stock market, which raises our credibility for expansion overseas and helps us maintain our employees,\" he said.\nVENTURING OVERSEAS\nMr Tanat said this year marks the start of YGG engaging in international partnerships, with big progress expected in 2025.\nThe company started by seeking a foreign alliance in the animation industry and aims to create an overseas distribution channel in the future, he said.\nCo-production, joint opportunities and risk-sharing are models that work in the international market, said Mr Tanat.\n\"These models can help us develop an upstream business and accelerate growth in the overseas market using sufficient investment,\" he said.\nYGG is inspired by the successful models of Japanese multinational video game company Nintendo and China's Tencent, said Mr Tanat.\n\"We have to expand beyond the domestic market as it is too small,\" he said. \"We need to have our own game intellectual property, with a distribution channel the next step. In a nutshell, we're leveraging our assets and extending our content formats to cover film, animation, games and merchandise.\"\nThe company wants to become a co-owner of gaming intellectual property to strengthen revenue streams in new formats on the global market, said Mr Tanat.\nTo achieve this goal, YGG seeks high-potential partners to collaborate on new projects, he said.\nFORAY INTO MOVIES\nYGG co-produced and co-invested in an animation series titled Hero Inside, which portrays various heroes from comic books. It partnered with companies such as Tencent and Million Volt, a subsidiary of South Korea's CJ ENM, on the project.\nThe project completed production on two seasons of the series. The first season was released in some international markets late last year.\nYGG also plans to develop games and merchandise out of the series, said Mr Tanat.\nThe company finished filming Home Sweet Home Rebirth, in collaboration with an American studio partner. It is a sequel to the Home Sweet Home game, which now has more than 370 million streaming views.\nThe film is expected to be released worldwide later this year, and the company is confident about the response, he said.\nMr Tanat said these projects are attempts by YGG to create Thai soft power in the global market through its products.\n\"This marks the initial step for YGG to participate in the production of a Hollywood-scale film,\" he said.\nHollywood-scale films have high market values, presenting an opportunity for the company to diversify and generate revenue in new formats, said Mr Tanat.\n\"We are confident our profits will grow as a result. Moving forward, you can expect YGG to transition from being a contractor to a creator in upcoming projects,\" he said.\nBy focusing on creating original content and owning gaming intellectual property, the company aims to increase its profile, improving opportunities for collaboration with potential partners to develop high-quality content, ultimately leading to revenue recognition in new formats, said Mr Tanat.\nYGG is in talks on several other projects with international partners, he said.\nThe company wants its sales and services business to gain 80% of revenue from the overseas market in 2025, up from the projected 50% this year and 40% in 2023, said Mr Tanat.\nAsia is the next growth destination for digital content, he said.\nYGG's ambition is to be in the SET100 within three years with a valuation of 20 billion baht, said Mr Tanat.\nMIX OF PEOPLE\nYGG was established by a group of young workers who are passionate about digital art, he said.\n\"The average age of our employees is 28-36. We have mixed expertise,\" Mr Tanat said.\nHe said his expertise is game-playing and business, while other board members are angel investors or have a financial background.\n\"This mix combines business and art,\" said Mr Tanat. \"In the digital content sector, we cannot think only about our own preferences, as we must focus on the business and potential market.\"\nYGG can retain talented employees by showing them the bright future for its business and allowing artistic people to be proud of their creativity, as it gains recognition for Thailand if the games become popular, he said.\nIf employees leave to establish their own business, YGG is eager to invest in them and bring them into its network, said Mr Tanat.\nHe said the founding members and employees still work with YGG, as it offers company stock to employees.\nSOFT POWER\nMr Tanat said in an effort to drive Thailand's soft power in games and animation, the government can facilitate co-investment or co-creation.\nHe said projects must provide proof of return on investment and key performance indicators, which might not be revenue, but rather soft power that helps to improve Thailand's tourism, image and brand recognition.\nProject owners must return investments to a soft power fund for reinvestment in new projects, said Mr Tanat. If a project is less successful, the government can allocate money to others.\nThe government can also hold discussions with Netflix or other over-the-top (OTT) operators about co-funding with Thai producers to promote Thai soft power in travel and food, he said.\n\"This could be a win-win. We'll have more distribution channels, gain bargaining power, and OTTs will have new content with some subsidised costs,\" Mr Tanat said.\nThailand has the creative capability for digital content, but makes up less than 1% of the global market and has lots of small studios, he said. Most Thai gaming studios have 10-20 employees, with only a handful mid-sized such as YGG with 250 staff.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhich app or platform do you usually use to book accommodations?\nBooking.com\nAgoda\nAirbnb\nTrip.com\nTraveloka\nExpedia\nSkyscanner\nDirectly with the accommodation\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nYggdrazil Group\nHome sweet home\nThai game\nThai game developer\nTanat Juwiwat\nDo you like the content of this article?\n0\n0\nCOMMENT\n(1)",

(Photo: Somchai Poomlard)\nThailand is experiencing an influx of foreign visitors as the government's visa-free policy for tourists from countries including China has given the industry a much-needed boost.\nHowever, business operators have called on the government to devise measures to address shortages of skilled labourers in the industry, improve transport infrastructure in provinces that are also major tourist spots, as well as deal with criminals exploiting the visa-exemption policy to enter the country and run illegal businesses.\nThailand is currently allowing visitors from Kazakhstan and China to stay for 30 days visa-free until Feb 29.\nADVERTISEMENT\nOn Jan 28, Thailand and China signed an agreement on a reciprocal visa-free scheme that will take effect from March 1.\nUnder the agreement, holders of valid, ordinary Thai passports and Chinese holders of passports for public affairs and ordinary passports will be exempt from visa requirements when entering or transiting through the other country for up to 30 days.\nRELATED\nbusiness\nEconomic concerns poised to curb the domestic tourism market\nbusiness\nThailand's Eastern Economic Corridor to include Prachin Buri\nCumulative stays must not exceed 90 days in any 180-day period, except for the purposes of residing or engaging in employment, study, media activities or other activities that require prior approval.\nMeanwhile, Russian passport holders can stay in Thailand for 90 days until April 30, while Indian and Taiwanese tourists can also enjoy a 30-day stay until May 10.\nLast year, Thailand drew about 28 million foreign tourists and 1.2 trillion baht in revenue, well short of the record of almost 40 million arrivals and 1.9 trillion baht in revenue in 2019 or before the Covid-19 pandemic, according to the Tourism and Sports Ministry.\nThe Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT) said Malaysians made up the largest group of visitors to Thailand, with around 4.5 million visitors last year while Chinese tourists formed the second-largest group with about 3.51 million visitors.\nBut as of Feb 1, Chinese travellers tallied more than 533,000 this year, followed by arrivals from Malaysia at more than 337,000 and South Korea at more than 229,000.\nThe Chinese comprised the biggest group of visitors in pre-pandemic 2019, with about 11 million.\nThe Tourism and Sports Ministry is confident the country can attract 35 million foreign visitors this year after 3 million arrived in January.\nSeasonality factor\nAccording to the Kasikorn Research Centre, a subsidiary of KBank, the Chinese formed the biggest group of tourists visiting Thailand last month due to several factors, including a seasonality factor as Chinese travellers often go on holidays toward the end of the year or soon after for Chinese New Year, which fell on Feb 10 this year.\nAnother factor is Thailand's visa-exemption measure for Chinese tourists, which started on Sept 25 last year.\nAccording to the research centre, China is expected to become Thailand's top source of foreign arrivals by the end of this year, with an estimated 5.2 million arrivals.\nThis is because the momentum of Chinese tourists visiting Thailand is expected to continue to gather pace this year.\nHowever, the return of Chinese tourists may take a while as economic challenges in China deter Chinese from travelling abroad while travel costs remain high, especially for those with relatively low incomes, according to the centre.\nSurawat Akaraworamat, vice-presi\u00ad- dent of the Tourism Council of Thailand, told the Bangkok Post that Chinese tourists have entered Thailand visa-free since September last year.\nSo, the reciprocal visa-free scheme that will take effect from March 1 should not lead to any further significant increase in Chinese arrivals. Instead, the number of Thais visiting China is expected to increase, he said.\nMr Surawat said that due to China's economic problems this year's Chinese visitors are markedly different to those who came back in 2019.\n\"This year we have a decrease in group tours from China but the number of Chinese travelling independently without being a part of a tour group is increasing. So, operators in the hospitality industry must adjust their approaches to respond to the trend,'' he said.\nHe also said Thailand's visa-free policy may also prompt Chinese businesses to invest in Thailand's tourism industry using Thai nominees, which will enable them to compete with local business operators. \"Even though Thailand has laws in place to deal with Thais acting as nominees on behalf of foreigners, the problem is that law enforcers do not measure up. This area [law enforcement] needs to be improved,'' he said.\nTourist safety\nHe also stressed the need for the government to devise measures to ensure foreign visitors' safety.\nLaws that belong to the Tourism and Sport Ministry and deal directly with tourism are few and far between, he said, adding that most of the laws belong to other ministries, such as the Public Health Ministry, the Transport Ministry and the Interior Ministry.\n\"There should be a law that is designed specifically to ensure foreign tourists' safety,'' he said. \"Moreover, if the government wants to use Thai culture as soft power to attract international visitors, it should take the matter seriously. The private sector is already trying to promote the country's soft power,'' he said\n\"At least, the TAT should carry on with its campaign to promote cultural resources as categorised into 5Fs: food, film, fashion, fighting (Thai martial arts) and festivals,'' he said. Mr Surawat said the government should also focus on travellers from the Middle East as they are big spenders, often staying at four-or five-star hotels.\nSurawat: Chinese tourists coming since Sept 2023\nThaneth Tantipiriyakij, president of the Phuket Tourist Association, echoed the view that group tours from China are falling, compared to the increasing number of free independent travellers (FITs) from China.\nThese FIT travellers may not arrive in large numbers, but they stay longer and spend more at local businesses than group tour travellers, he said.\nMr Thaneth also said that after Thailand and China signed the agreement on the reciprocal visa-free scheme, about 370 direct flights from China to Phuket have been booked for this month, with an expected surge of free independent travellers from China.\nCalls for govt help\nMr Thaneth also urged the government to hold talks with both domestic and international airline operators to increase flights to the island province and expand Phuket airport's capacity to handle more passengers in the future.\nHe also wanted the government to improve road access to Phuket, as there is currently only one road, while the private sector and local bodies in Phuket should be granted licences to operate public transport systems. Utilities such as water, electricity and wastewater treatment, should also be improved to handle a surge of tourists, he said.\nThaneth: Group tours from China are falling\nBhunanan Patanasin, president of the Pattaya Business and Tourism Association, hailed the visa-free policy, saying it has already attracted more Chinese tourists to Pattaya. He also said that most Chinese visitors travel on their own and are not part of any tour group. They stay at four-and five-star hotels and spend more than group tour travellers.\nHe also called on the government to develop measures to address problems affecting tourism in Pattaya, including shortages of skilled workers and a lack of intra-city and inter-provincial transport systems.\nRoad surfaces there should also be improved to ensure road safety and make it easy for visitors to travel, while the government should also push for more direct flights to U-Tapao airport to bring in more tourists to Pattaya and other nearby provinces in eastern Thailand.\nBhunanan: Huge increase in tours to Pattaya\nHi-tech to tackle crime\nPol Lt Gen Jirabhop Bhuridej, commissioner of the Central Investigation Bureau (CIB), told the Bangkok Post he was concerned that some criminals will exploit the visa-free policy to enter Thailand and operate illegal businesses here.\n\"Urgent measures must be devised to deal with various crimes systematically,\" and he said that looking after the safety of foreign visitors and Thai people is also a priority. \"Thailand will not be an easy place for criminals. The police will do all they can to make life difficult for them. We will crack down on them.\"\nHe admitted that conventional approaches, such as street patrols, may not be enough to deal with some crimes. Modern technologies have been brought in to support immigration control and investigate the backgrounds of suspects arriving in Thailand. Long-distance high-speed thermal imaging cameras have also been installed along the border to detect foreigners who enter the country illegally via natural channels, Pol Lt Gen Jirabhop said.\nHe said the CIB has worked with Chinese authorities to combat Chinese criminals who pretend to be tourists and run illegal businesses here. \"Thailand will not be a paradise for transnational criminal syndicates. Thais must not support illegal foreign businesses by acting as nominees,\" he said.\nJirabhop: Criminals may exploit visa-free policy\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat type of accommodation do you usually prefer when traveling in Thailand?\nLuxury hotels (5-star)\nMid-range hotels (3-4 star)\nHostels and guesthouses\nPrivate rentals (Airbnb or villas)\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nVisa\nFee\nWaiver\nTourists\nVisitors\nArrivals\nCriminal\nCrime\nDo you like the content of this article?\n18\n262\nCOMMENT\n(41)",

(Photo: Apichart Jinakul)\nThe government is planning to enlist Chinese social-media influencers to hawk things from the so-called elephant pants to local sweet delicacies to their followers back home, as part of the Southeast Asian nation\u2019s bid to shore up exports to the world\u2019s No. 2 economy.\nThirty to 50 of China's top influencers will be invited to Thailand for a week in May, Deputy Prime Minister and Commerce Minister Phumtham Wechayachai said in an interview to\nBloomberg News\nin Bangkok on Tuesday. The intent is to get them to livestream about Thai goods, he said.\n\"The world is changing,\" Mr Phumtham said. \"We have to think about new ways of selling things.\"&nbsp;\nADVERTISEMENT\nWhat is in it for the influencers? The government will share profits from the sales with them to incentivise their efforts. \"If it fails, we lose nothing,\" Mr Phumtham said. \"If it's successful, we plan to expand this tactic to other things.\"\nRead more:\n&nbsp;\nChinese-made elephant pants face import ban\nWhile Thailand has in the past thought up the idea of tapping influencers to boost tourism, the latest initiative comes after exports to China dropped for the first time in seven years in 2022 \u2014 relegating the Asian giant to the No. 2 spot for Thai goods after the United States.\nRELATED\nbusiness\nADB upgrades Thailand growth forecast, trims developing Asia's outlook\nbusiness\nXiaomi teases Tesla-like SUV for summer in big EV expansion\nEnsuring growth of exports is key to achieving Prime Minister and Finance Minister Srettha Thavisin's goal to boost annual economic output to 5% during his term.\nThat is an ambitious target for an economy, where growth has averaged just 1.8% in the past decade, making it the region\u2019s laggard. That performance was due to cycles of military coups and political instability, which eroded investor confidence and competitiveness against peers like Vietnam, Malaysia and Indonesia.\nExports, a key engine of the Thai economy, contracted 1% in 2023 after notching 5.4% growth in 2022. The Ministry of Commerce set up a 2024 working target of 1%-2% export growth, while the Ministry of Finance forecast a 4.2% rise in the sector that normally accounts for about half of the country\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP).&nbsp;\n'Boys love'\nIn tandem with the plan to use Chinese influencers to grow exports, Thailand is also exploring ways to promote local products and tourist destinations through placements in an upcoming \"boys love\" television series. The government has tapped two popular Thai heartthrobs who command a massive following across Southeast Asian markets, China, South Korea and Japan to help with the mass-marketing effort through their upcoming new show called \"\nShine\n\".\nMr Phumtham recalled meeting the actors, Phakphum \"Mile\" Romsaithong and Nattawin \"Apo\" Wattanagitiphat, last week to launch the project in front of hundreds of screaming fans \u2014 many of whom hailed from neighbouring countries like Malaysia and Singapore.&nbsp;\nCommerce Minister Phumtham Wechayachai, centre, says the government pledges to spend millions of baht to promote Y Series as part of its soft power promotional plan.

Across the Asean region, HSBC has also been honoured as the \"Best International Bank\" in five of the six Asean countries in which it operates, namely Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, the Philippines and Vietnam.\nADVERTISEMENT\nIn addition, HSBC Thailand has earned further 9 accolades such as Thailand's \"Best Service Provider for Transaction Banking\" and Thailand's \"Best Service Provider for Trade Finance\" from the Asset Triple A Awards 2024. These awards, many of which have been won consecutively over several years, highlight HSBC's deep roots and solid expertise in the Thai market as the country\u2019s first bank since 1888.\nInternational Connectivity\nWith a strong global network across 60 countries, HSBC empowers its local branch to support Thai businesses, particularly in cross-border banking services, where the bank holds a significant advantage.\nRELATED\nworld\nSingapore oil tycoon OK Lim sentenced to 17 years in jail\nbusiness\nScandal stalks stocks\nAs one of the largest financial institutions in the world, HSBC facilitates cross-border investments on a global scale, helping clients connect business flows across major trade corridors where the bank maintains an active presence.\nHSBC\u2019s international connectivity, combined with its extensive expertise, breadth, and perspective, uniquely positions the bank to unlock new opportunities for both Thai and foreign clients.\nMr Gamba emphasised that HSBC Thailand has leveraged the strengths and advantages of its parent company to support all customer segments, including multinational firms, large Thai corporations, and medium-sized businesses. At the same time, HSBC Thailand is committed to meeting the needs of all customer segments through its comprehensive financial solutions.\nHSBC Thailand\u2019s cross-border banking and related financial services have been specifically designed to facilitate both inbound and outbound investments for its clients. &nbsp;\nHSBC Thailand supports Thai businesses in expanding into 41 countries.\n\"On average, we assist each local customer in expanding their business to three different countries. We also have two Thai clients with operations in over 20 countries globally,\" noted Mr Gamba.\nDespite these achievements, HSBC remains focused on continually developing innovative financial products and services to fully support its clients. The bank is also committed to strengthening collaboration with both the public and private sector to facilitate local business growth and contribute to the Thai economy.\nStrategic Partnership with the BOI\nAccording to Mr Gamba, HSBC Thailand has also signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the Board of Investment (BOI) to support Thailand\u2019s inward and outward foreign direct investment (FDI) flows. This partnership aims to leverage HSBC\u2019s international network, spanning 60 countries, to capture global FDI opportunities for Thailand.\nThrough this cooperation, HSBC Thailand will assist the BOI in promoting Thailand as a key investment hub in Southeast Asia. The bank will also support international investment roadshows to showcase Thailand's potential to global investors.\n\u201cOur role in this partnership is to support the BOI on international investment roadshows to showcase Thailand\u2019s potentials to the world. We aim to work with the BOI to develop new trade and investment corridors where HSBC has a presence, particularly the United Kingdom, Mainland China, Hong Kong, India, Saudi Arabia, ASEAN, and Europe,\u201d Mr. Gamba added.\nThailand has long been a key manufacturing hub in the region and remains a vital component of many global supply chains. This strategic position continues to make the country an attractive destination for large-scale investments from both Asean countries and global markets.\n\u201cAs a regional manufacturing powerhouse, Thailand is quite strong and attractive for FDI in several industries, especially the auto industry. Thailand stands to gain significantly from the global growth of electric vehicles [EVs], especially from Chinese manufacturers, positioning the country to become a key player in this sector.\u201d\nThailand continues to be a vital market for international corporations and a prime destination for FDI. Additionally, HSBC Thailand is focused on facilitating investments in strategic sectors where Thailand possesses a distinct competitive advantage, Mr. Gamba said.\nAccording to Mr Gamba, HSBC\u2019s country strategy aligns with Thailand\u2019s national plan, particularly in sectors such as EVs, digital innovation, and environmental, social, and governance (ESG) initiatives. The bank\u2019s key international clients from China, intra-Asean, and the US are also following Thailand\u2019s FDI trends.\nDigital Banking&nbsp;\nThe development of digital banking is another crucial area for supporting business growth in Thailand. HSBC has launched HSBC UniTransact, an innovative digital solution designed to streamline cross-border transactions with enhanced speed, cost efficiency and transparency.\nSince its introduction in 2022, HSBC Thailand has seen a remarkable 34% increase in cross-border payment turnover, along with a substantial 27% rise in the number of cross-border transactions.\nMoreover, HSBC ranks as the global leader in digital payments and is investing an additional US$2 billion in digital banking transformation. The institution processes over 4 billion transactions annually, totaling around $600 trillion.\nGlobal Private Banking\nAs a leading international bank in Thailand, HSBC has long provided financial services to both local and global businesses. While large corporations and multinational firms have traditionally formed the core of the bank\u2019s customer base, HSBC Thailand is increasingly expanding its Global Private Banking business to support the ambitions of Thai HNWI and UHNWI to manage, grow, and preserve their wealth legacy for generations to come.&nbsp;\nHSBC Global Private Banking ranks among one of Asia\u2019s largest private banks with an extensive regional footprint. It operates in over 40 markets and 13 strategic booking centres across the globe. This makes us stand out against competition to offer global wealth and mobility solutions to our clients. Our Global Private Banking in Thailand is the 2nd onshore location in Southeast Asia, bringing access to a wide range of sophisticated wealth product into the local market.\nConfidence in Thailand\n\"We are committed to growing our business, expanding our client base, investing in Thailand, and helping our clients connect with regional and global opportunities to invest and grow,\" said Mr Gamba.\n\"We will work closely with the government to shape industrial policy and create client opportunities.

The event brought together experts from various fields to share insights and visions about Thailand's economic landscape, future trends and how Thai organisations should prepare to cope with coming challenges. The forum attracted over a hundred leading businessmen. Participants gained access to the latest information on business-related laws, taxes and technologies fostering dialogue and networking opportunities among entrepreneurs, investors and specialists across diverse sectors.&nbsp;\nMr. Rob Hurenkamp\nMr. Rob Hurenkamp\n, Managing Partner of Forvis Mazars in Thailand,\nopened the forum by emphasising the significant challenges facing Thai organisations in a rapidly evolving global environment. \"This forum serves as a critical platform to provide our clients and partners with insights and knowledge about economic trends and various changes, including tax laws that will impact business operations in Thailand, both for Thai companies and Thai individuals operating internationally. There are numerous challenging factors that organisations need to be fully prepared to address.\"\nDr Arnunchanog Sukondhavat, Director of the Macroeconomic Strategy and Planning Division at the National Economic and Social Development Council (NESDC),\nexplained the factors influencing the future economy. These include shifts in political power dynamics, the implementation of various regulatory policies that can impact economic stability and uncertainty, changes in trade regulations and technological advancements. Particularly the Artificial Intelligence (AI), the Internet of Things (IoT), and blockchain, which must be leveraged to maintain competitiveness. These advancements present both opportunities and risks that require careful consideration.&nbsp; Additionally, the issue of sustainability is crucial, and Thailand must adapt to climate change and resource scarcity by adopting sustainable practices in future business operations.\nForvis Mazars'\nconsulting team\nand experts presented at the forum include:\nOutsourcing Partner Mr. Jonathan Fryer, Legal Partner Mr. Chatchawat Kriengsuntikul, Tax Partner Mr. Jonathan Stuart-Smith, Financial Advisory Partner Mr. Prasenjit Chakraborty, Audit Partner Ms. Tippawan Pumbansao, along with other top executives in Thailand.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\nMr. Chatchawat Kriengsuntikul, the Legal Partner\noffered insights into the legal perspectives of global challenges facing Thailand. Key trends impacting Thai laws and regulations include the shifting economic landscape which is influencing Thailand-China trade development. The enforcement of the Draft Climate Change Act will significantly affect the country's greenhouse gas emissions and business operation costs. The draft Electronic Transaction Act aims to modernise the legal framework for digital transactions. Organisations should proactively plan their tax strategies to minimise expenses.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\nMr. Jonathan Fryer, Outsourcing Partner,\nsaid the next trend is Autonomous Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents, which can make significant decisions autonomously without human intervention. AI can help organisations reduce costs, enhance transactional efficiency, analyse financial data for crucial decision-making, identify market trends and opportunities and effectively set business direction.&nbsp;\nMs. Tippawan Pumbansao (centre)\nAccording to Audit Partner Ms.Tippawan Pumbansao, another crucial area for organisations to focus on is navigating climate change and resource scarcity and refining their ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) reporting practices. Compliance with environmental and new economic policies is crucial to maintaining competitiveness in both domestic and international markets.&nbsp; Transparency in sustainability reporting is increasingly important and must be subject to rigorous audits, similar to financial reports to meet sustainability auditing standards.&nbsp; &nbsp;\n\"These factors highlight the significant challenges facing Thai organisations in a rapidly changing global landscape.

She has the potential to usher in a global trade revival that could lift the US economy and enhance US global leadership, according to the office.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe US may consider rejoining the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), giving Thailand second thoughts about applying for membership to expand trade with pact members, noted the TPSO.\nThailand may benefit from investments in Industry 4.0 and technology transfer via an intensified partnership with CPTPP countries.\nRELATED\nbusiness\nCrypto poised for uptick through 2025\nbusiness\nBitcoin even more buoyant\nMr Trump has proposed up to 100% tariffs on Chinese goods and a blanket tariff of 10-20% on all other imports, while Ms Harris is expected to largely stick with President Biden's targeted tariffs on certain Chinese imports, such as a 100% rate on electric vehicles and a 50% rate on solar panels.\nThis could affect supply chains linked to China, meaning Thailand may have to adjust by expanding to other markets to diversify risk, according to the office.\n\"If Ms Harris wins the election, this may open opportunities for Thai companies with expertise in clean energy such as solar, wind and biomass for joint investment in the US, as well as technology transfer for the production of high-performance batteries for Thailand,\" noted the TPSO.\nIn terms of digital innovation and technology, Ms Harris' policies could encourage investment in 5G and artificial intelligence, opening up opportunities for Thai telecom and software companies to join the global supply chain, as well as the exchange of knowledge and experience in smart city development.\nFurthermore, there may be opportunities for joint ventures between Thai and US companies in agritech, in which Thailand has a comparative advantage.\nMs Harris is trying to raise the minimum wage and social welfare in the US. Even though it may increase production costs, it is unlikely to have a direct impact on inflation in Thailand.\nShe also wants to lower prescription drug costs and energy costs, which may help stabilise product prices in the world market, which will be beneficial controlling inflation in Thailand.\nThe US inflation control policy may ease pressure on the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates, which will help reduce the volatility of the baht and inflation in Thailand.\nIf Mr Trump wins, there may be a significant increase in tariffs on Chinese imports of up to 60% or more, according to the agency.\nThere is also an opportunity for US companies to relocate their manufacturing bases to Thailand, while demand for products from Thailand may increase, offering opportunities for Thai entrepreneurs to be part of the global supply chain.\nHowever, the US may impose non-tariff barriers such as health and environmental regulations and food standards to protect consumers and preserve the environment, noted the TPSO.\n\"Thai entrepreneurs should comply with environmental regulations and standards to build trust and create opportunities to be part of the global supply chain,\" Mr Poonpong said.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat type of condominium are you most interested in?\nStudio\n1-bedroom\n2-bedroom\n3-bedroom\nPenthouse\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nUS presidential election\nPolicy\nTrade\nUs election\nDo you like the content of this article?\n4\n27\nCOMMENT\n(6)",

Public support for using reactors in Taiwan plunged in 2011 when neighbouring Japan was struck by an earthquake that wrecked the Fukushima plant, leading to a crisis Tokyo is still sorting out.\nRELATED\nopinion\nNo more bailouts\nopinion\nParole process hints at Yingluck's return\nThe opposition to nuclear power is getting harder to maintain given the incessant demand that the artificial intelligence boom is placing on chipmakers like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Taiwan has raised electricity prices twice this year, with the latest being a 12.5% increase for industrial users that began earlier this month.\nStill, TSMC Chief Executive Officer C C Wei said during a post-earnings call Thursday that the company has been assured by the government it will have enough electricity, water and land to support expansion.\nTaiwan isn't alone in taking a closer look at nuclear to boost power supply. Microsoft Corp is helping revive the shuttered Three Mile Island nuclear plant in Pennsylvania by agreeing to buy all the output. Meanwhile, Alphabet Inc's Google and\nAmazon.com\nInc are both investing in next-generation nuclear technology.\nThe Philippines and South Korea have also agreed to conduct a feasibility study on possibly rehabbing the Southeast Asian nation's mothballed nuclear plant.\nTaiwan's rethink also comes as China's military has staged drills that appear to simulate a blockade of the self-ruled island that's home to 23 million people. Though there are no signs of imminent conflict, the risk of Taiwan being cut off from important energy supplies is one that officials such as Mr Cho must consider.\nUnderscoring the interest in someday embracing nuclear power, the 65-year-old Cho said he'd ask the state-backed power provider to make sure that personnel from the archipelago's decommissioned reactors stay in their jobs. Taiwan is set to close its last nuclear reactor in the spring.\n\"This is because we need to prepare for future nuclear technology developments and to respond to any potential legal changes in Taiwan,\" Mr Cho said.\nIn addition to boosting power demand, surging global investment in AI has also put Taiwan's chipmakers, especially TSMC, in the spotlight because they make the vast majority of the world's most advanced semiconductors.\nThe US, Japan, and other governments have, in turn, sought to lure TSMC to build chip plants on their soil.\nThe government of Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te, of which Mr Cho is a member, has been fine with TSMC's overseas expansion. In Thursday's interview, Mr Cho linked that expansion to Taiwan's efforts to build stronger ties with like-minded democracies to counter China, which claims the island as its territory and has pledged to eventually bring it under Beijing's control, by force if necessary.\nThat said, Mr Cho also hopes firms like Nvidia Corp, Infineon Technologies AG and Advanced Micro Devices Inc will open R&amp;D facilities in Taiwan.\n\"Taiwan's economic resiliency comes from the partnership we have with friendly countries,\" he said. \"We have a strong vertically integrated supply chain. This is why we believe Taiwan can play an important role in the democratic supply chain.\"\nOf course, Taiwan's efforts to bolster its security go beyond semiconductors. The government announced plans in August to lift defence spending to a record in 2025 -- the eighth straight year of increases. The total figure would account for 2.45% of estimated GDP next year, in line with recent years and greater than the 2% target for Nato countries.\nThat hasn't satisfied everyone. Former US president Donald Trump recently made comments to a columnist for the Washington Post that suggested Taiwan should boost spending on its armed forces to 10% of GDP.\nMr Cho, a former chairman of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party, said in response, \"While we cannot allocate 10% of GDP to defence in one go, we have increased the budget compared to the past\".\n\"We also hope that through Taiwan's efforts, the world will recognise Taiwan's determination and provide greater support,\" he added.\nIn the interview, Cho also reiterated the government's desire to expand defence ties with the US and other nations which are looking to reduce their supply-chain links to China. One example he mentioned was that Taiwan recently hosted a number of executives from overseas drone makers. If successful, the strategy would create more incentive for those governments to come to Taiwan's aid in an emergency.\n\"Because Taiwan understands its role in the democratic supply chain and the world's reliance on Taiwan, I often say that the more Taiwan is needed, the more important it becomes,\" Mr Cho said. \"We are continuously moving forward on this path.\"\u2009\u00a92024 Bloomberg\nMatthew Winkler is editor in chief emeritus of Bloomberg News.

Since then, foreign policy has been patchy and hostage to polarisation and domestic political volatility. It is time to chart a way forward for Thailand's international standing and role despite ongoing political conflict at home.\nAt its peak, Thai foreign policy pivoted around three principal pillars, namely the Asia Cooperation Dialogue (ACD), the Ayeyawady-Chao Phraya-Mekong Economic Cooperation (Acmecs), and bilateral free-trade agreements. In hindsight, it was a bold and innovative platform in contrast to the traditionally reactive and passive foreign policy in the past. It was less the famous pragmatism of \"bending with the wind\" but more designed to set wind conditions.\nIt leveraged Thailand's geographical advantages as the mainland centre of Asean and Southeast Asia's central location on the Asian landmass, thereby underpinning the Acmecs focusing on the Mekong countries and Asia-wide ACD stretching from the Korean Peninsula to the Middle East. These were complemented by more than ten bilateral FTAs with key countries in different regions, such as Chile and Peru in South America and Bahrain in the Middle East, alongside Australia, New Zealand, Japan, the United States, and the European Free Trade Agreement (Efta), comprising Norway, Switzerland, Iceland, and Liechtenstein.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThis foreign policy outlook was laid out at a time of the global war on terror following the al-Qaeda Islamist terrorism on Sept 11 against the US. It was a time when the multilateral trading system was becoming problematic, with more and more economies resorting to regional and bilateral FTAs. It was a juncture when Asean was on the rise while its leading spokesmen at the time, such as Lee Kuan Yew of Singapore and Mahathir Mohamad of Malaysia, were about to retire, although the latter prime minister later came back to politics. Thailand had an ambition for a higher and more prominent place in the world.\nThe Thai government was then under the leadership of Thaksin Shinawatra and his juggernaut, the Thai Rak Thai Party, which used its electoral dominance after January 2001 to set out such assertive foreign policy directions. Of course, Mr Thaksin and his associates were controversial and beset with conflict of interest and graft allegations, as evident in his corruption convictions and jail terms, which he accepted on returning to the country in August 2023 after 15 years in exile. Vociferous critics of Mr Thaksin's conflict of interest and autocratic tendencies, this author included, saw in the ensuing years that his enemies and adversaries who staged military coups and judicial interventions in connivance with anti-Thaksin politicians were no better on the graft front and were so incompetent that Thailand was mismanaged to its lowest international standing.\nRELATED\nworld\nPhilippine ship 'deliberately rammed' Chinese vessel, says China\nthailand\nKrungsri, MUFG Boost Regional Growth with ASEAN Link&nbsp;\nMore than 20 years later, it is hard to dispute that Thailand had its best foreign policy game and reached the pinnacle of its international profile back then. If a particular juncture had to be pinpointed, it would have been about the time when Thailand hosted the summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation in October 2003 and was looked upon by its regional peers and other major powers as an up-and-coming middle power, a player to be reckoned with on the global stage.\nThis foreign policy assertion with self-confidence was stalled and undermined in short order after Thai Rak Thai won a spectacular landslide re-election in February 2005. The country steadily declined and stagnated since, punctuated by the two coups in 2006 and 2014 and the Constitutional Court's seemingly routine dissolutions of political parties that won elections. Foreign relations became problematic because of domestic politics. Priorities shifted to internal security and away from prosperity. Instead of seeking international prominence, Thailand had to keep making explanations and excuses for its electoral manipulation and subversion at home, not to mention the military's suppression of anti-coup street protests in 2009-10 and again in 2020.\nFew of the FTAs got through, whereas the Thai-US FTA was weaponised by anti-Thaksin columns as treason and had to be abandoned. The Australian and New Zealand FTAs got through and proved a boon for Thailand's external trade. The Japan-Thailand Economic Partnership Agreement was kept on track and finalised after the 2006 coup. The rest of the FTA strategy was in tatters by the 2014 coup when Thailand turned inward as part of the full securitisation of the monarchy. The Thai-Efta deal is still being negotiated today and is reportedly close to completion. But what a waste of the past 20 years.\nTo regain its foreign policy projection and international prestige and standing, Thailand needs to get back its self-confidence and ambition. Doing so is difficult when the government is constantly being destabilised by saboteurs and spoilers who keep filing charges and petitions with the Constitutional Court after losing elections time and again.\nBut eventually, Thailand will need to get its foreign policy act together. When that happens, the focus should be building its middle power potential. Despite domestic divisions, no one objects to Thailand becoming a middle power. It carries a rare internal consensus the way that the Marriage Equality Act sailed through parliament with flying colours. The only major political party that espoused such a \"middle power\" strategy was Move Forward, which was dissolved by the Constitutional Court.\nYet the middle power idea and strategy to realise it should remain on the table. This means that the Paetongtarn government should not fall back on reviving the ACD and Acmecs out of convenience and lack of imagination. The logic and opportunity of these two platforms are no longer timely and fit for purpose. Joining the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) should be the medium- and longer-term objective. Although membership accession takes longer, the OECD's criteria of liberalisation and openness are the kind of structural reforms Thailand requires to move forward. Indonesia has made this calculation and commitment.\nIf Thailand is to be part of the recently expanded Brics -- Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa plus new autocratic members comprising Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia, and the United Arab Emirates -- then it should stick closely with Malaysia and any other Asean member state that joins. Beyond OECD and Brics consideration, Thailand needs to get back aggressive on its FTA track and aim to complete trade deals with Efta expeditiously and with the European Union sooner rather than later.\nThese trade deals lead to reforms and adjustments that can take the Thai economy forward and boost foreign relations with crucial countries in the international community. Being a middle power with a pro-democracy orientation, located in mainland Southeast Asia with an unrivalled set of relations with the great powers, is where Thailand should want to be.\nThitinan Pongsudhirak\nSenior fellow of the Institute of Security and International Studies at Chulalongkorn University\nA professor and senior fellow of the Institute of Security and International Studies at Chulalongkorn University\u2019s Faculty of Political Science, he earned a PhD from the London School of Economics with a top dissertation prize in 2002.

That will not come until the next meeting of China\u2019s rubber-stamp legislature, which needs to approve the issuance of new debt. A date has yet to be announced but it is expected in a few weeks.\n\u201cThe strength of the announced fiscal stimulus plan is weaker than expected. There\u2019s no timetable, no amount, no details of how the money will be spent,\u201d said Huang Yan, investment manager at private fund company Shanghai QiuYang Capital Co in Shanghai.\nRELATED\nthailand\nPolice chief orders probe into VIP escort service sold online\nthailand\nSamyan Mitrtown set to cross three-year milestone with community-centric offerings\nHuang had hoped for more stimulus to boost consumption. Market analysts had been looking for a spending package that would range between 2 trillion and 10 trillion yuan ($283 billion to $1.4 trillion).\nSaturday\u2019s announcement \u201cwas strong on determination but lacking in numerical details\u201d, said Vasu Menon, managing director for investment strategy at OCBC in Singapore.\n\u201cThe big bang fiscal stimulus that investors were hoping for to keep the stock market rally going did not come through,\u201d he said, adding this may disappoint some in the market.\nMany key economic indicators in recent months have missed forecasts, raising concerns among economists and investors that the government\u2019s 5% growth target this year was at risk and that a longer-term structural slowdown could be in play.\nData for September, which will be released over the coming week, is expected to show further weakness, but officials have expressed \u201cfull confidence\u201d that the 2024 target will be met.\nNew fiscal stimulus has been the subject of intense speculation in global financial markets after the Politburo last month signalled an increased sense of urgency about the economy.\nChinese stocks reached two-year highs, spiking 25% within days after the meeting of the Communist Party\u2019s top leaders, before retreating as nerves set in given the absence of further policy details.\nGlobal commodity markets from iron ore to industrial metals and oil have also been volatile on hopes that stimulus will stoke sluggish Chinese demand.\n$285 billion in bonds\nReuters reported last month that China plans to issue special bonds worth about 2 trillion yuan ($285 billion) this year as part of fresh stimulus.\nHalf of that would be used to help local governments tackle their debt problems, while the other half would subsidise purchases of home appliances and other goods as well as finance a monthly allowance of about 800 yuan ($114) per child to all households with two or more children.\nSeparately, Bloomberg News reported that China is also considering injecting up to 1 trillion yuan ($140 billion) of capital into its biggest state banks, though analysts say more lending would come up against stubbornly weak demand for credit.\nThe central bank in late September announced the most aggressive monetary support measures since the Covid-19 pandemic, including interest rate cuts, a 1-trillion-yuan liquidity injection and other steps to support the property and stock markets.\nWhile the measures have lifted market sentiment, analysts say Beijing also needs to firmly address more deeply rooted structural issues such as boosting consumption and reducing its reliance on debt-fuelled infrastructure investment.\nDwindling returns\nMost of China\u2019s fiscal stimulus still goes into investment, but this leads to debt outpacing economic growth as returns are dwindling.\nThe International Monetary Fund estimates central government debt at 24% of economic output. But the fund calculates overall public debt, including that of local governments, at about $16 trillion, or 116% of GDP.\n\u201cThere is still relatively big room for China to issue debt and increase the fiscal deficit,\u201d said Lan.\nLocal governments still have a combined 2.3 trillion yuan to spend in the last three months of this year, including debt quotas and unused funds, he said. Municipalities will be allowed to repurchase unused land from property developers, he said.\nLow wages, high youth unemployment and a feeble social safety net mean China\u2019s household spending is less than 40% of annual economic output, some 20 percentage points below the global average. Investment, by comparison, is 20 points above.\nChinese officials have repeatedly pledged over the past decade to increase efforts to boost domestic demand, but made little progress on that front, which would require a fundamental structural rethink of many policies and institutions.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat is your preferred house size (in terms of number of bedrooms)?\n1 bedroom\n2\u20133 bedrooms\n4+ bedrooms\nNo preference\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nChine\nEconomy\nStimulus\nConsumption\nProperty sector\nDo you like the content of this article?\n8\n16\nCOMMENT\n(8)",

Powerhouse is an iconic development that reimagines luxury living within the historical walls of one of London\u2019s last great industrial landmarks.&nbsp;\nAlexandra Chan, Senior Sales &amp; Marketing Manager for Hutchison Property Group Limited and CK Asset\u2019s spokesperson for the launch, commented on the appeal of the newly launched property, \"Powerhouse at Chelsea Waterfront offers a truly unique blend of historical elegance and contemporary luxury, right on the River Thames. With starting prices at GBP 1,100,000, this prime Chelsea development presents an incredible opportunity to live in one of London\u2019s most iconic riverside locations. Furthermore, the meticulous attention to detail, from the spacious, beautifully designed interiors to the world-class amenities, ensures an unparalleled living experience.\" &nbsp;\nPowerhouse is situated on the northern bank of the Thames, in the prestigious Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, which is home to some of the world\u2019s most renowned celebrities. Its thoughtfully designed apartments boast spacious interiors, which are a rarity in London, as well as luxurious amenities and one of London\u2019s best views over the River Thames, particularly from Tower West, its adjacent 37-storey residence.&nbsp;\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe development\u2019s total value tallies to GBP 1.8 billion (approx. THB 79 billion). The first two phases of the development are completed and ready to move in, including Powerhouse and Tower West, which offer a total of 434 units, 60% of which have been sold.

The London high-end property market continues to grow, with strong interest from international buyers, including Thai investors.&nbsp;&nbsp;\nUK government policies, which allow full purchasing rights for Thais and other foreign buyers, in addition to favorable financing options, have contributed to making Powerhouse at Chelsea Waterfront a prime investment opportunity.&nbsp;&nbsp;\nThai investors are particularly motivated by the potential for long-term residences in proximity to London\u2019s most prestigious educational institutions for their children. Highly esteemed schools such as Thomas\u2019s Battersea \u2014 whose notable pupils included Prince George, Princess Charlotte and other members of the royal family \u2014 and Godolphin and Latymer School, among others, are located in close proximity.

In parallel with these regulatory frameworks, Asean has now launched new voluntary guidance on AI governance and ethics, aiming to facilitate innovation.\nBut is laying out another framework that Asean most needs? While the new document will help establish common views between member states as they set their national rules, developing concrete guidelines that have buy-in from all member states is challenging given their diverse levels of digital maturity, and the rapid proliferation of frameworks in other regions like the US, EU and China.\nADVERTISEMENT\nInstead, the \"Asean way\" for AI governance should perhaps look more targeted. Rather than identifying common principles, which risks reinventing the wheel, Asean should take a flexible minilateral approach that pulls together interested member-states to tackle the issues that are most relevant to them, such as addressing the potential for AI to empower scammers and cybercriminals and finding ways to draw AI talent and investment to the region.\nEmbracing differences\nAsean released its \"Guide on AI Governance and Ethics\" in February 2024, centring on high-level principles like transparency and human-centricity. Given the diversity among Asean countries in digital maturity and willingness to regulate, the guide's flexibility is fitting.\nRather than prescribing a one-size-fits-all solution for organisations, it provides a toolkit of options. Where it speaks to member states and the region, its recommendations often focus on innovation, capacity-building, and investing in talent.\nBut this very versatility could create challenges in implementation. The 87-page document may be too weighty for an SME's first foray into AI, yet too high-level to be immediately actionable. This is all the more so given the proliferation of competing guidance from established bodies, like the OECD's AI Principles or the NIST AI Risk Management Framework.\nThe Asean guide may wind up seeming redundant as the technology evolves and global standards evolve with it.\nRather than trying to develop a comprehensive framework, Asean's AI governance work might be better off if member states homed in on their highest priorities. The guide suggests setting up an Asean Working Group on AI Governance, which could kickstart region-wide efforts to cooperate in these areas. But many conversations may benefit from minilateral arrangements, involving subsets of the ten Asean member states.\nThese minilateral arrangements should emphasise localisation, asking what Asean can bring to the table. They should also emphasise flexible involvement, encouraging member states to be involved in a more ad-hoc fashion based on the issue, as different groupings of Asean countries will be motivated to solve different problems.\nSmashing scams\nOne priority that Asean should tackle is the impact of AI systems on scams and cybercrime. Scam operations in Southeast Asia already trap hundreds of thousands of human trafficking victims and cost billions annually, but AI could turbo-charge this problem.\nLarge language models make it easier to generate targeted scam messages at scale, and real-time deepfakes have already been used in a high-profile case to steal US$25 million (836.5 million baht) from a multinational company in Hong Kong. Voice cloning capabilities could open up new vectors of attack, allowing scammers to make ransom scam calls in the voice of people's loved ones.\nAsean needs to pre-empt abuse of these tools, some of which are not widespread purely due to the temporary good grace of tech companies. OpenAI, for example, is withholding its voice cloning model due to risks of misuse; even fiercely pro-open-source Meta refuses to release its Voicebox model.\nIt may only be so long before similarly capable models become popular, and Asean should make full use of this grace period before they do. Having proposed Asean's new anti-online scams working group, Thailand could be a natural advocate for this issue.\nThose countries with strong and growing digital industries, like Singapore, Malaysia, Vietnam, the Philippines, and Indonesia, could also join forces to build up the region's overall talent pool. One natural starting point would be attracting foreign AI talent, given Southeast Asia's popularity with remote workers. Many Asean countries have rolled out digital nomad visas or targeted entrepreneurs and tech workers explicitly. At a regional level, there may be lessons worth sharing or perhaps even a joint tourism or visa campaign worth investing in.\nThese countries could also make a combined effort to draw MNCs to invest in regional talent and infrastructure, as in Microsoft's plan to upskill 2.5 million people in AI across Asean, and Google's Asia-Pacific AI Opportunity Fund. To appeal to firms wanting to enter the Southeast Asian market, they could also develop a shared repository of business opportunities and localisation partners to reduce friction for investors.\nSuch efforts may be a tougher sell as member states may want to compete, not cooperate -- as they did over Taylor Swift. But given the speed of the AI race, they should consider joining forces, lest other blocs eclipse them. To make the most of AI, Asean member states must lean into their and the region's particular interests -- embracing the diversity, flexibility, and pragmatism that has become a signature of the Asean way.\nShuan Ee is a Policy and Strategy Manager and Jam Kraprayoon is a researcher at the San Francisco-based Institute of AI Policy and Strategy (IAPS).\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhich app or platform do you usually use to book accommodations?\nBooking.com\nAgoda\nAirbnb\nTrip.com\nTraveloka\nExpedia\nSkyscanner\nDirectly with the accommodation\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nAi\nArtificial intelligence\nAsean\nAsian\nDo you like the content of this article?\n7\n2\nCOMMENT\n(1)",

Yet the Asean economy remains resilient, estimated to grow by 4.6% in 2024.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe meeting emphasised three key strategies to strengthen Asean's economic resilience as global expansion is projected to be subdued.\nThe first strategy is for Asean to be more resilient and agile by focusing on developing robust mechanisms to manage economic volatility, investing in future-oriented industries and strengthening regional collaboration.\nRELATED\nopinion\nRegional antidotes to counter Trump\nthailand\nKey panel appointment for negotiation with Cambodia may face delay\nSecondly, the meeting emphasised the need to boost intra-Asean trade to its fullest potential to develop the region's economic strength and cushion Asean's vulnerabilities against the ramifications of global shocks.\nThe third strategy is for the bloc to fully explore trade potential with strategic and emerging economies. This is to reduce the effects of global demand fragility on Asean's growth potential.\nFurthermore, Asean should conclude negotiations on the upgraded Asean Trade in Goods Agreement in 2025 to maximise the effective utilisation of the advantages of regional integration.\nThe meeting also pushed for accelerating the completion of Asean's Digital Economy Framework Agreement negotiations, aiming to reach the target of 50% of negotiations in 2024.\nThe AEC Council met to discuss the progress and outcomes of various AEC initiatives in 2024 under the Asean Economic Pillar, which include the negotiations on the upgraded Asean-China Free Trade Agreement, preparation of the report on the revision of the Asean Framework Agreement on Intellectual Property Rights Cooperation, and the establishment of Asean-wide unique business identification numbers.\nAfter 2025, it must strive to strengthen its position in embracing sustainability and climate response, building a digitally resilient Asean, and ensuring the centrality of inclusivity in its initiatives, particularly for micro, small and medium-sized enterprises to ensure that no one is left behind and to narrow the development gap.\nThe meeting discussed the way forward in crafting the AEC Strategic Plan to implement the Asean Community Vision 2045 before presenting to the 44th and 45th Asean Summits on Oct 9-11.\nThe council ministers approved and endorsed documents for economic deliverables, which are forwarded to be endorsed by Asean leaders at the Asean Summits on Wednesday.\nThese include the Asean Leaders' Declaration on Enhancing Supply Chains Connectivity, Vientiane Declaration on Narrowing the Development Gap in Asean and Regional Guidelines for Sustainable Agriculture in Asean.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhich app or platform do you usually use to book accommodations?\nBooking.com\nAgoda\nAirbnb\nTrip.com\nTraveloka\nExpedia\nSkyscanner\nDirectly with the accommodation\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nAsean Summit\nTrade\nCommerce\nTalk\nDo you like the content of this article?\n0\n0\nCOMMENT",

I personally believe that the SET is not less attractive than other regional bourses as the continued recovery of the tourism sector and additional economic stimulus to be launched by the government will drive the SET index to finish at 1,470 points by the year end,\" she said.\nADVERTISEMENT\nVAYU1 has received strong interest from investors since its inception, having been able to mobilise 130 billion baht from institutional investors and 20 billion baht from retail investors. The fund began investing in Thai equities at the start of this month by focusing on stocks with good fundamentals, strong corporate governance, and the long-term value of the companies.\nCurrently, half of its investment portfolio is in SET50 stocks, 40% in government bonds, and the remainder in corporate debentures with a credit rating of A or higher, added Ms Chavinda.\nRELATED\nbusiness\nUnwinding the Dr Boon scandal\nbusiness\nSET lacks catalysts until year-end\nVAYU1 soared 1% in morning trade on Monday to finish at 10.10 baht by midday, outpacing the SET's 0.3% increase overall, with a trading value of 2.55 billion baht. The increase, however, lagged Pluk Phak Praw Rak Mae (OKJ), which debuted on the SET last Friday and jumped 10.4% to close at 13.7 baht by midday.\nApichart Phubancherdkul, head of strategy research at Tisco Securities, shared a similar view as Ms Chavinda, saying VAYU1 would help stabilise Thai stocks when the market is under a portfolio adjustment among foreign investors due to overseas factors.\n\"Foreign investors are now adjusting their portfolio after they gained a profit of nearly 20% due to the recent appreciation of the baht. Now, the Thai currency is depreciating as the dollar is now traded at a two-month high and the US bond yield is at 4% after stronger than expected employment data eased recession fears of the US economy,\" he pointed out.\nAlso, intensified tensions in the Middle East have prompted foreign capital outflows from emerging markets including Thailand, Mr Apichart added.\nAccording to Asia Plus Securities, foreigners were net sellers in Asian stock markets in the month to date, with outflows of US$2.5 billion from the Indian stock market, $877 million from Taiwan, $156 million from South Korea, $114 million from Indonesia, and $330 million or 11 billion baht from Thailand.\nFinance Minister Pichai Chunhavajira said VAYU1 has drawn significant interest from investors, demonstrating that trust and confidence have returned to the Thai stock market.\nHe believes that more capital will flow into the stock market in the foreseeable future.\n\"Over the past year, especially in the first half, there were significant uncertainties, leading to considerable volatility in the capital market, causing fundraising and trading to decrease significantly. This was compounded by concerns about whether the trading system provided equal opportunities for all investor groups. However, the SET and the Securities and Exchange Commission [SEC] have worked together to address these issues, bringing back understanding and restoring confidence,\" he said.\n\"I believe that the Vayupak Fund 1 will help rebuild trust and revive investments from both local and foreign investors.\"\nMr Pichai also mentioned that China has recently used a similar approach to the Vayupak Fund and has been highly successful. This shows that this approach is a \"win-win solution\" for the government, the market, and investors, he noted.\nHe is also feeling bullish that in the near future there is likely to be more investment flowing into the SET from both domestic and international sources, as there are still a lot of funds that have been kept in other forms of deposits, and investors are believed to now analyse how to adjust their investment portfolios.\n\"Nevertheless, I believe that more capital will come in [to the stock market], especially given the declining interest rates. As a result, those who have kept their money in fixed-income assets are likely to shift towards floating-income assets or capital market assets. The Vayupak Fund is a hybrid fund, meaning it is part fixed-income and part floating-income,\" he said.\nMr Pichai added that global investors are now closely watching the stock markets in the Asia-Pacific and Southeast Asian regions, which have become major targets for investment.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat type of house are you most interested in?\nSingle-family home\nTownhouse\nSemi-detached house\nVilla\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nInvestment\nVayupak Fund\nStock\nIndex\nDo you like the content of this article?\n4\n4\nCOMMENT\n(1)",

(File photo: Reuters)\nKUALA LUMPUR - Oracle plans to invest more than US$6.5 billion to set up its first public cloud region in Malaysia, the company said on Wednesday, the latest major investment by a global tech firm into the Southeast Asian country.\nTechnology giants, including Microsoft, Nvidia, Alphabet unit Google and China's ByteDance, have announced billions of dollars' worth of digital investments into Malaysia since last year, mostly in cloud services and data centres, powering an infrastructure boom driven by growing demand for artificial intelligence (AI).\nA cloud region is the physical, geographic location where a company's public cloud facilities are located. Oracle's venture is set to be one of the largest single tech investments so far, outpacing the $6.2 billion planned spending by Amazon's cloud unit AWS announced last year.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe planned public cloud region will help organisations in Malaysia modernise their applications, migrate their workload to the cloud, and innovate with data, analytics and AI, the US firm said in a statement.\nIt would also allow the firm's Malaysian customers which include government agencies, financial institutions, and airline and hospitality companies, to use cloud services based in the country, rather than those based externally, said Oracle's Executive Vice President for Japan and Asia Pacific Garrett Ilg.\nRELATED\nbusiness\nHong Kong leads Asian shares higher\nlearning\nThai teen designs new Red Bull F1 livery\n\"Those customers look to Oracle to support their innovation ... to move into standardised processes to be faster, to be more controlled and be more cost-effective,\" Ilg told\nReuters\nin an interview.\nThe cloud region in Malaysia would be Oracle's third in Southeast Asia, after its two existing facilities in Singapore. It currently has 50 public cloud regions across 24 countries, according to its website.\nOracle last month raised its fiscal 2026 revenue forecast and said it expects to cross $100 billion in revenue in fiscal 2029, indicating rising demand for its cloud services.\nThe company also wants to continue its expansion across Asia, with more data centres and infrastructure projects planned \"from Japan all the way down to New Zealand... all the way to India,\" Ilg said.\nChris Chelliah, Oracle's senior vice president for technology and customer strategy in Japan and Asia Pacific, said Malaysia provided further growth potential and market opportunities for the company as part of a broader AI and data centre development push in Southeast Asia.\nIn the past year, Microsoft has announced cloud services investments worth $1.7 billion in Indonesia, while Amazon has announced plans to invest $9 billion in Singapore and $5 billion in Thailand.\nGoogle on Tuesday broke ground on a $2 billion data centre in Malaysia, part of investments that it said would contribute more than $3 billion to the country's economy by 2030.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat is your budget range for purchasing a condominium?\nEkkamai-Thong Lor\nSathorn-Silom\nChidlom-Siam\nBang Na\nChinatown\nAri\nRiverside\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nOracle\nInvestment\nMalaysia\nAsean\nTech\nDo you like the content of this article?\n26\n1\nCOMMENT\n(2)",

Against this background, Asean leaders will meet among themselves and with their dialogue partners immediately after to deliberate key issues affecting the community of 675 million citizens.\nOn the economic front, Asean is more robust and confident. As the world's fifth-largest economy, with a combined GDP of US$3.8 trillion (122 trillion baht), it is projected to rank fourth by 2030. Asean's economy is a force to be reckoned with. Furthermore, its economic growth, at 4.6%, is expected to surpass the global average of 3.2%.\nADVERTISEMENT\nAs Laos will hand the baton to the next chair, Malaysia, on Oct 11, there are several issues to observe to judge whether Vientiane has effectively delivered results in its soon-to-end one-year tenure.\nDespite the multitude of pressing domestic issues, the chair must continue to work to achieve consensus among the 10 member countries and dialogue partners.\nSome of these issues to watch for are the following.\nFirst, the world is closely watching what will transpire at the 19th East Asia Summit (EAS) to be held in tandem with this Asean meeting in Vientiane.\nThis year's issue will be the worsening geopolitical landscape in Europe and the Middle East. Last year, the Indonesian chair failed to reach a consensus for a joint EAS statement because of disputed wording on the Ukraine-Russia war. Jakarta opted for the chairman's statement, which is its pejorative, while requesting other EAS members not to issue statements.\nSince the war started in February 2022, the situation in Ukraine has not improved, and the Middle East has also worsened. Israel has been trying to eliminate Hamas for the past year without much achievement. Now, Israel has expanded the war to Lebanon, where arch-rival Hezbollah is located. As it turns out, the talk of a ceasefire so far has been just been kicking the can down the road at the expense of civilian casualties.\nIt must be said that the current Middle East crisis will impact Asean solidarity and its citizens like never before. More specifically, workers from Asean countries, including Thais, have been killed and held hostage as part of the Gaza-Israel conflict. Collectively, Asean has had to appeal for the safety of its citizens in the war zone.\nMeanwhile, the Ukraine-Russia war, which has previously caused disagreements among EAS members, will remain a bone of contention at this EAS.\nIt remains to be seen whether Laos can enable EAS members to reach a consensus on a joint EAS statement. The joint statement is important as it demonstrates that the EAS remains a premium strategic forum for exchanging views on serious global issues in a neutral venue.\nThe Myanmar crisis will also take centre stage, focusing on the progress and implementation of humanitarian assistance as per one point of the Asean Five-Point Consensus. Regarding progress, the Asean Coordinating Centre for Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Management (AHA Centre) has been coordinating aid through the World Food Programme in affected areas inside Myanmar. Thailand recently contributed 9 million baht to the AHA Center for this purpose.\nIn the foreseeable future, there will be two special meetings.\nOne on the Myanmar crisis, will be a meeting of special envoys hosted by Indonesia. It must be noted, the Paetongtarn government has yet to appoint a special Thai envoy on Myanmar.\nThe second is the Asean Troika Plus meeting, scheduled for mid-December in Bangkok. For this meeting, Asean will seek to create common ground for all stakeholders in the Myanmar crisis to find a Myanmar-led solution. Asean members do not want major powers to use the Myanmar quagmire as a proxy war.\nFurthermore, the world's largest free trade agreement, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), is expanding -- this regional economic bloc was built in 2012 upon the existing Asean+1 FTA. Now, three more economies -- Hong Kong, Sri Lanka, and Chile -- have applied to become RCEP members.\nSome members have proposed a \"pre-screening\" step before the accession process. Asean is playing a key role in finalising the accession procedures -- closer consultations and collaboration among major RCEP economies such as Japan and China are needed. The RCEP comprises the Asean-10, China, Japan, Korea, Australia, and New Zealand. India pulled out due to domestic pressure over local farm policies.\nFinally, Asean is currently working on an Asean Community Vision 2045. Over the past year and a half, the Asean High-Level Task Force has crafted this vision. In the next two decades, they want to see Asean agile and relevant in a fast-changing world.\nFor that, Asean prioritises three key areas: digital transformation, sustainable development, and connectivity. By next year, under Malaysia's chairmanship, the first region-wide digital economy in the world, the Asean Digital Economic Framework Agreement, will be completed. This will further strengthen the bloc's efforts to promote digital transformation and connectivity.\nOn sustainability, the bloc has launched the Asean Strategy for Carbon Neutrality to attract more investment and align with international standards for the region's green future. In terms of connectivity, Asean is also developing the Asean Connectivity Strategic Plan, a key document within the Asean Community Vision 2045.\nFinally, at the summit, there will be the chair's 14 economic deliverables (seven will be completed by the end of the year) including enhancing supply chain connectivity, addressing financial gaps for micro, small, and medium enterprises, and upgrading the Asean-China Free Trade Agreement 3.0. These represent the legacy of the Lao chair in 2024.\nKavi Chongkittavorn is a veteran journalist on regional affairs.\nKavi Chongkittavorn\nA veteran journalist on regional affairs\nKavi Chongkittavorn is a veteran journalist on regional affairs\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat is your budget range for purchasing a house in Thailand?\nUnder 3 million THB\n3 million - 5 million THB\n5 million - 8 million THB\n8 million - 12 million THB\nOver 12 million THB\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nThailand\nOpinion\nAsean\nVientiane\n\u0e2d\u0e32\u0e40\u0e0b\u0e35\u0e22\u0e19\n\u0e40\u0e27\u0e35\u0e22\u0e07\u0e08\u0e31\u0e19\u0e17\u0e19\u0e4c\nLeaders\nLaos\nSummit\nDo you like the content of this article?\n5\n18\nCOMMENT\n(2)",

However, in the fourth quarter, we will start to see a slowdown in developed economies, especially in the manufacturing sector (late cycle), which will cause the Asian economy to slow down in the next 3-6 months.\nNew interest rate era: Major central banks, such as those in Europe, the UK, Switzerland and Sweden, have started to cut interest rates. The US Federal Reserve recently made a move for the first time in four years, with a reduction of 50 basis points. It has signalled a further 50bps of cuts this year and possibly another 100bps next year.\nADVERTISEMENT\nNew political era: The outcome of the US election will affect the global economy and politics. Kamala Harris stresses the public welfare with policies that are less business-friendly, especially her plans to raise corporate taxes. In contrast, Donald Trump supports businesses through corporate tax cuts, but would intensify trade wars.\nRegardless of who becomes president, putting campaign policies into action will be challenging as a divided Congress is highly possible. In addition, the risk of a cold war with China remains, increasing global trade risks.\nRELATED\nbusiness\nJitta Wealth promotes US stocks for the coming year\nbusiness\nCGSI forecasts stagnant first-half for Thai stock market\nFED TO MOVE QUICKLY\nLooking at the impact of monetary policy, we expect the Fed to make six rate cuts of 25bps by the end of the first half of 2025, and to slow to quarterly cuts in the second half.\nOther central banks will cut rates at a slower pace, but in any case there will be financial volatility.\nThe US Treasury yield curve, which is normalising from an inverted one, reflects the market's belief in rapid Fed rate cuts. This phenomenon leads to a so-called bull-steepening scenario, where short-term yields decrease faster than the long-term one. Historically this is not favourable for risky assets.\nIn terms of exchange rates, faster and more significant Fed rate cuts compared with those of other central banks will likely weaken the US dollar against currencies such as the yen and euro, as well as the baht, which will strengthen.\nWe foresee the US economy, despite exceeding growth expectations, slowing down in the future, with a soft landing scenario continuing into 2025.\nThe European economy, although improving, will grow more slowly, while China's economy will slow significantly, with our GDP growth forecast adjusted from 5.0% to 4.8%.\nThe latest monetary stimulus indicates a stronger intention to boost the economy and capital markets in China.\nThe People's Bank of China has cut key short-, medium- and long-term loan rates, as well as mortgage interest rates by 20-25bps. The regulator also cut the reserve requirement ratio for commercial banks by 50bps, freeing up 1 trillion yuan ($140 billion) for new lending.\nAn 800-billion-yuan fund is expected to inject capital into the Chinese stock market. Coupled with easing in fiscal policy, expected to be announced soon, these measures could significantly help the Chinese economy, which currently is entering a Japanese-style lost decade scenario.\nTHAI OUTLOOK IMPROVING\nFor the Thai economy, the first half of 2024 saw a significant slowdown because of tight domestic fiscal and monetary policies. The former led to lower capital budget disbursements because of the delayed budget process.\nThe latter led to contracting private investment and durable goods consumption amid strict lending standards. This caused a credit contraction throughout the first half.\nHowever, the change at prime minister and the long-awaited unlocking of the digital wallet stimulus should allow the economy, which slowed in the second and third quarters, to recover in the fourth, with growth expected at 3.5% year-on-year, up from the previous forecast of 2.9%. We project 2.5% growth for the full year.\nIn 2025, the economy will benefit from monetary and fiscal measures, with investment disbursements growing by at least 10.5%. Policy interest rates could be cut by 100bps in 2024-25, but exports may slow, in line with the US and Chinese economies, leading to modest 3% growth next year.\nIn terms of investment strategy, we expect increased market volatility in the final quarter of 2024, benefiting from lower interest rates, which will boost emerging markets compared with developed markets.\nThe weaker dollar will attract capital inflows into emerging markets and Thailand, while initiatives such as the digital wallet, the Vayupak Fund, and 2025 budget disbursement will support investment to some extent.\nThese factors will benefit large domestically focused companies with strong financial positions, reducing the impact of external volatility and the fluctuation and appreciation of the baht. We recommend BDMS, CPALL, HANA and LHHOTEL as standout stocks in the fourth quarter, with a SET index target of 1,500 points in 2024 and 1,550 in 2025.\nDr Piyasak Manason is head of the investment strategy department at InnovestX Securities Co Ltd, a subsidiary of SCBX group.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat is your budget range for renting a condominium?\nUnder 10,000 THB/month\n10,000 - 20,000 THB/month\n20,000 - 40,000 THB/month\n40,000 - 60,000 THB/month\nOver 60,000 THB/month\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nStocks\nInvestment\nDo you like the content of this article?\n4\n0\nCOMMENT",

In line with this trend and following the mainstream popularity of Sichuan-style hotpot in Thailand, Haidilao is proud to introduce a new, unique flavour to Thai tables: the Guizhou Sour Soup Hotpot.&nbsp;\nThis represents not only a fresh, distinctive flavour to delight our guests, but also a fitting debut for Guizhou regional cuisine in Thailand. For Haidilao, the introduction of the Guizhou Sour Soup base marks another breakthrough in our international journey, a worthy addition to our flavour portfolio to enrich our diners' experience of Chinese cuisine. &nbsp;\nThe Long History and Cultural Heritage of Guizhou Sour Soup In China:\n&nbsp;\nADVERTISEMENT\nGuizhou Sour Soup (Gui Zhou Suan Tang Guo) is a traditional dish of the Miao, Dong and other peoples of southeastern Guizhou, with thousands of years of cultural heritage behind it. The most distinctive feature of Guizhou Sour Soup is its tanginess, offering a complex flavour profile: it leads with a sour zest, balanced by a subtle mineral saltiness, all set against a rich, mellow texture. &nbsp;\nThe soup is bright red, vibrant and appetizing. Its tang comes from tomatoes and chili peppers, which are washed, chopped and mixed with salt, then sealed in jars to induce natural fermentation. The intensely red, mouthwatering result is a natural, fragrant, healthy and highly original soup base. &nbsp;\nCompared to Haidilao's classic spicy base, Guizhou\u2019s fermented sour soup offers a fresh, sharp and appetizing flavour with a mellow texture, which is perfect for health-conscious consumers. It appeals to all age groups and satisfies family dining needs.&nbsp;\nThe charm of Guizhou sour soup lies not only in its taste but also in the cultural connotations it carries. Guizhou is home to many ethnic groups, each with its own culinary traditions and cooking techniques. As one of the representative dishes of Guizhou, sour soup is a symbol of the collective wisdom of these ethnic cultures. In Miao culture, sour soup is not only an important part of daily meals but also a symbol of family gatherings and welcoming guests. This flavourful soup reflects Guizhou's natural beauty and embodies a deep respect for nature and a love for life. Haidilao Thailand presents this cultural treasure to the world under the name \"Guizhou Red Sour Soup.\"&nbsp;\nFrom Local Delicacy to Global Stage\n: &nbsp;\nFamed for its unique sour and fresh flavour, Guizhou sour soup has been widely popular in China. With the rise of Chinese cuisine on the global stage, this regional delicacy now has an opportunity to shine internationally. &nbsp;\nThailand, with its love of sour flavours in its own culinary scene, naturally aligns with the flavour profile of Guizhou sour soup. Haidilao has carefully selected a variety of high-quality ingredients to complement the sour soup, ensuring Thai diners can fully experience its deliciousness. Peppercorn beef tongue, with its fragrant spicy flavour, adds layers to the tangy soup, while the tender texture of Haidilao's beef slices enhances the fresh taste. Additionally, seafood such as scallops, prawns, and shrimp paste, along with vegetables like bamboo shoots, sweet potato noodles, bean sprouts and golden slices, are paired with the Guizhou Sour Soup base, offering diners a delightful surprise with every bite. &nbsp;\nContinuous Localisation Strategy as an Engine for Product Innovation\n&nbsp;\nOperating worldwide as Superhi International, Haidilao aims to provide customers with an exceptional dining experience \u2013 localisation is an excellent way to engage diners in every country in an innovative flavour journey. To this end, Super Hi International Holding Ltd. customises products and services based on local customer preferences. In the first half of 2024 alone, Tehai International optimised and launched more than 500 products across various categories, including hotpot bases, dishes, snacks, and drinks. Popular new products were launched in each country, such as Pepper Chicken Soup base and Golden Sour Fish soup base in East Asia, Saffron Chicken Soup base in the UAE, and Spicy Lamb Scorpion (lamb spine) hotpot in the UK.&nbsp;\nEntering Thailand in 2019, Haidilao quickly gained popularity with its unique service concept and excellent dining experience: \u201cFood is the simplest and most effective way of cultural exchange.\u201d From introducing the Tom Yum soup base to adjusting dishes and condiments to suit Thai preferences, Haidilao has blended its brand's essence with local tastes, offering customers a novel and delightful culinary experience. In terms of service, Haidilao adapted its service model and staff training to fit local culture. Through local hiring, flexible training, and cultural integration, Haidilao overcame language and cultural barriers and quickly established itself in the Thai market. Haidilao adheres to the philosophy of \u201cinnovation and sharing,\u201d constantly innovating and striving for excellence. &nbsp;\nThe introduction of the Guizhou Sour Soup base further enriches customers' options, offering an opportunity to sample a deeply authentic Chinese regional flavour that is highly suited to the traditional Thai palate.&nbsp;\nWith the promotion of Guizhou sour soup in the Thai market, Haidilao hopes this traditional Chinese dish will become a bridge connecting Chinese and Thai culinary cultures. In the context of globalisation, Haidilao will continue to explore and promote more regional Chinese delicacies. Internationally, Haidilao aims to let food lovers worldwide experience the unique charm and profound heritage of Chinese cuisine. &nbsp;\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat is your budget range for purchasing a house in Thailand?\nUnder 3 million THB\n3 million - 5 million THB\n5 million - 8 million THB\n8 million - 12 million THB\nOver 12 million THB\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nDo you like the content of this article?\n6\n0\nCOMMENT",

The seminar runs from Sept 16-19.\nADVERTISEMENT\nOmar Toulan, professor of strategy and international management at IMD Switzerland, said digital infrastructure, skill-based training and institutional stability, sometimes called \"soft infrastructure\", underline a country's competitiveness.\nThe rule of law needs to be streamlined, with stable policies after a change of governments, he said.\nRELATED\nbusiness\nHong Kong opens third airport runway with marginal gain in landing slots\nbusiness\nGourmet Market sets out expansion plans\nKitipong Urapeepatanapong, chair of the Stock Exchange of Thailand, said the nation needs to speedily reform regulations as such change is too slow in recent decades.\nRules need to be enforced, which is a major challenge as some enforcement in Thailand can take 3-6 years, said Mr Kitipong.\nThe country also needs to expand financial access for SMEs, as around 67% of Thai SMEs are family businesses that can be encouraged to list on the stock market.\n\"Universities and large corporations can share their knowledge and equip SMEs with technology,\" said Mr Kitipong.\nFor example, he said Thailand can relax some rules for SMEs in targeted sectors such as healthcare, agriculture, electric vehicles (EVs) and hospitality to help them quickly raise funds.\nSelective S-curve\nNithi Patarachoke, TMA chairman, said Thailand has two main challenges, with the first limited industry growth. The country has many mature industries and too many new S-curve targets.\n\"We need to prioritise S-curve industries such as EVs and amend the law to support e-waste, in particular recycling of EV batteries, which can be a big business in Thailand,\" said Mr Nithi.\n\"Healthcare, hospitality, green energy and IT also have potential for growth.\"\nThe second challenge is low productivity, in particular in agriculture, which employs 30-40% of the country's workforce, but contributes only 10% of GDP, he said.\n\"We can move to upstream, high value-added areas such as food processing, building brands for export to Southeast Asia, and creating biomass for green energy,\" said Mr Nithi.\nIntegrate with Asean\nChartsiri Sophonpanich, president of Bangkok Bank, said with technological change, geopolitical risk and environmental impact from severe weather events, the country needs to expand physical infrastructure beyond Bangkok and connect with Asean.\n\"The Asean region represents an opportunity for Thailand and many Thai corporations already have expanded,\" he said.\nDigital infrastructure is also important and businesses need to apply technology such as artificial intelligence (AI) to increase productivity and build talent to move forward, said Mr Chartsiri.\nPayong Srivanich, chief executive of Krungthai Bank, said data is the foundation for \"future-ready\" countries, which should be open for access, rather than limited to some groups.\nCare Economy\nSantitarn Sathirathai, future economy advisor at Thailand Development Research Institute, said to make the country future-ready, it needs to be up to date with major trends such as ageing and AI.\nThailand also needs to know its weaknesses and have the right mindset to \"ride the wave of opportunity\", he said.\nOne trend is the care economy, which covers medical, wellness, preventive healthcare, food, and sensors for medical devices.\n\"There is strong global demand for the care economy and Thailand is an aged society. The country has great doctors, nurses, herbal remedies and healthcare services. We can develop AI-based applications that serve healthcare,\" said Mr Santitarn.\nRisk as opportunity\nMr Kitipong said Thailand can gain an advantage from geopolitical risk, in particular from venture capital from Israel, Russia, China and Vietnam.\n\"We can be a financial hub and talent pool for foreign investment, opening our doors for foreigners to establish businesses in Thailand,\" he said.\nMr Nithi said to gain a geopolitical advantage, the country needs to have a strong ecosystem that serves a target sector. For example, Indonesia has a complete supply chain for EV batteries.\nMr Toulan said in terms of the global supply chain, Thailand needs to be agile, acting fast to gain an advantage from geopolitical risk by positioning itself as an attractive outsourcing location apart from China.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nIf you were to buy real estate in Thailand outside of Bangkok, which area would be your top choice?\nChiang Mai\nPhuket\nPattaya\nKhao Yai\nKoh Samui\nHua Hin\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nEconomy\nDevelopment\nThailand\nDo you like the content of this article?\n6\n23\nCOMMENT\n(13)",

The initial investment totals 400 million baht.\nRELATED\nthailand\nHylife Developments Wins Asia Pacific Fast Enterprise Award\nthailand\nHylife Group Celebrates Grand Opening of their New Headquarters, Signaling Growth and Innovation\nHylife held an original equipment manufacturing contract for raw materials, including mangoes, sourced from local growers over the past several years. The company purchases 2,000 tonnes of mangoes per month and up to 200 tonnes of processed mango may be shipped to the US monthly under the Costco brand.\nMr Das says the vision of the property developer is to become a leader in Thailand, then gradually expand to other markets in Asia.\nFINANCE NEEDED\n\"We seek opportunities in multiple segments, but we have been quite sustainable with self-financing to date. For the next step, we will move on to bank financing to tap into the next stage of growth,\" he said.\n\"We also have an ambitious goal of an initial public offering by 2030 to raise funds to fuel the company's growth.\"\nMr Das said management is concentrating on three stock exchanges for a possible listing: Thailand, Singapore and Hong Kong.\n\"But of course, we need to evaluate this later in terms of capital availability because the main purpose of listing is to get capital to grow the business. Whichever country has more capital and will generate enough interest for our types of businesses, that will be the one we will opt to list on,\" he said.\nAmong the group's three businesses, Mr Das said property development will be the first to list because it is a \"very investment-heavy business\".\nEstablished in 2018, Hylife Developments operates a residential real estate development business, with a strategic focus on condos, commercial buildings and villas.\nThe company launched Hycondo Botanic and Hyparc 2 projects last year with a combined investment of 1.4 billion baht, together with an investment of 105 million baht in land.\nThis year the developer commenced construction of Hycondo Botanic, while studying the feasibility of developing the Hycondo 4 project, both located in Chiang Mai.\nHe said the vision of Hylife Developments is to become a leading real estate developer in Thailand, gradually expanding into other Asian markets.\nSECOND-TIER CITIES\nAccording to Mr Das, Hylife Group has invested more than 4 billion baht in Thailand, with more in the pipeline.\nWith registered capital exceeding 630 million baht, the group employs more than 350 individuals in the country.\nPart of the group's vision is to develop Chiang Mai into a leading second-tier city, partly by investing in innovation and manufacturing in Thailand, importing technologies and talent from around the world that can benefit the country, he said.\n\"Chiang Mai is a second-tier city, but its growth lags its peers in the region,\" said Mr Das.\n\"The city has a lot of potential based on its location and business-friendly environment.\"\nChiang Mai has a young population, but experienced brain drain because of a lack of opportunities, he said.\nThere is also an increasing need for housing based on large and growing local and expat communities, said Mr Das.\n\"We want to take a leadership role in Chiang Mai, investing in businesses that do not exist here, making a meaningful impact and developing the economy,\" he said.\nWhile the property and manufacturing operations of the group are located in Chiang Mai, Hylife's asset management business has expanded to other areas including Bangkok, Chon Buri, Ayutthaya, Chiang Rai, Surat Thani and Maha Sarakham.\nHylife Asset is a private, non-bank financial institution specialising in asset-backed finance and asset management services, serving companies and individuals looking for loan options.\nPinnacle Asset Management ac-quires and rehabilitates non-performing loans from both financial and non-financial institutions in the country.\n\"We aim to become the largest non-performing asset manager in the northern region by 2026 and one of the top five in Thailand by 2028,\" said Richard Teo, Hylife Group's director of operations and transformation.\nTAXING FOREIGN PURCHASERS\nIn Mr Das's view, Thailand is stuck in the middle income trap, noting it is hard to get out of \"without significant investment in skills development\".\nThailand should look to Singapore, which allows 100% condo ownership, but with a tax on foreign buyers, he said. The city-state revises this tax every year based on market conditions, and it has reached as high as 60% when the real estate market heats up.\n\"The Singapore model generates a lot of tax revenue, which should be invested completely in skills development to raise the level of affordability for locals,\" he said.\nThailand, which has a significant amount of undeveloped land, could follow this model, which has been very successful in Singapore despite the lack of available land there, said Mr Das.\n\"This is also a solution for the high level of household debt in Thailand because the value of property would increase, making it easier for local people to clear their debts,\" he said.\nMeanwhile, growth in property value is a major driver of the Thai economy, similar to the environment in other countries such as China and Singapore.\n\"A land lease of 99 years is pretty standard across the world, so there's no reason why Thailand shouldn't implement it. A tax on foreigners allows locals to have an advantage,\" said Mr Das.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat is your budget range for purchasing a house in Thailand?\nUnder 3 million THB\n3 million - 5 million THB\n5 million - 8 million THB\n8 million - 12 million THB\nOver 12 million THB\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nHylife\nIPO\nProperty\nDo you like the content of this article?\n14\n4\nCOMMENT",

These attractions include water parks, skywalks with stunning views, art spaces and learning centres.\n\"Not all provinces have abundant beautiful natural resources to lure tourists. Some places require promotion and man-made development,\" said Ms Somradee.\nWuthichai Luangamornlert, board chairman of the International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions, said there are opportunities for man-made developments in Thailand to serve all generations.\nMajor tourism destinations such as Phuket, Bangkok and Chiang Mai can still add these components to their list of attractions, he said.\n\"Each family member tends to have different preferences. Some may want to visit natural sites, while others prefer cafes, gaming centres or bars to watch entertainment,\" said Mr Wuthichai.\nINVESTMENT TREND\nGiven the uncertain global economy, he said investors in Thailand and Southeast Asia have slowed developments, cautiously building new attractions that were delayed by the pandemic.\nThe economic outlook has hampered spending, with lower disposable income and budget cuts for leisure activities, including at amusement parks, said Mr Wuthichai.\nIn Thailand, some amusement park and water park operators have temporarily suspended services on weekdays or during the low season to save on costs. Many regularly offer promotions to maintain healthy traffic, he said.\nMr Wuthichai, who is also the owner of Siam Amazing Park, said foot traffic is lower this year at Thai amusement parks, with revenue estimated to decline 30-40% in 2024 year-on-year.\n\"Global trends show development shifting from standalone theme parks and attractions to mixed-use projects with all-inclusive programmes. Thailand doesn't have many projects of this type,\" he said.\nMixed-use projects cater to all generations, encouraging longer stays and higher spending within one space, such as Ocean Park Hong Kong, which boasts an aquarium, roller coaster, water park and hotels.\nGrande Centre Point Space Pattaya features a water park within a hotel, while Nong Nooch Tropical Garden developed its own accommodation. More malls in Bangkok are developing water parks to lure tourists.\nENTERTAINMENT COMPLEX\nWhile the Thai government mulls a large entertainment complex that includes a casino, other nations in the region already have this product, said Mr Wuthichai.\n\"Having an entertainment complex in Thailand is better than not having one, and such products can increase tourism spending and extend lengths of stay,\" he said.\nHowever, Mr Wuthichai said the government's focus remains unclear, unsure of whether to prioritise a new complex for families or prevent Thais from gambling overseas.\nHe said focusing on families would create more benefits, as illustrated by successful cases in Singapore, Macau and Las Vegas. Those destinations draw large numbers of families with children with a wide range of services such as restaurants, entertainment shows and amusement parks.\n\"Not many people would stay in a casino for a whole day,\" said Mr Wuthichai.\nRegulations regarding the percentage of space for the casino, the location and the entrance policy need to be clarified before the complex can be launched. A public hearing with stakeholders is needed to iron out the details, he said.\nLOCAL STORIES\nMany communities and authorities are planning their own attractions to tell the story of their local culture, said Patara Suwannakarn, managing director of Peranakan Phuket Museum.\nMr Patara, who is also managing director of Taweesuwan, a family-owned jewellery business in Phuket, opened the museum dedicated to Peranakan culture in 2017, motivated by his love of galleries and museum tours.\nHe started by conducting in-depth research into Phuket-style jewellery and its relation to local lifestyles, costumes, arts and culture. Mr Patara also learned how to operate a museum by visiting other places in Thailand.\nThe result is an interactive museum, featuring retail space, a cafe, restaurant and jewellery shop inspired by the unique Peranakan culture.\n\"Phuket is no longer only about beaches and the sea. More people are keen to learn about local cultures while travelling,\" he said.\nThe museum receives guests from partner hotels and school tours, while locals donate furniture and garments to be displayed at the museum.\nThanks to the recovering tourism sector, visitor traffic in the first eight months of this year has already exceeded the total for 2023, said Mr Patara.\n\"We realise museums are a niche market, requiring a long time to make a profit. It's hard to survive solely on ticket sales. Other revenue sources are needed to support the business,\" he said.\nThe venue also hosts several wedding ceremonies, including Peranakan-style weddings.\nThe museum is planning to upgrade the customer experience by adding an organic farm and learning centre on a plot next to the museum.\nCompared with decades ago, Thailand now has many quality learning spaces and man-made attractions for both locals and tourists, said Mr Patara.\nAcademies such as Museum Siam offer classes for museum operators and curators. Local authorities and communities are also investing more to improve the quality of learning and tourism spaces, such as in Phangnga and Krabi.\nHe said the government should continue to promote cultural landmarks and museums to attract new tourists, hiring influencers to highlight attractions on social media.\nNEXT PHASE\nMs Somradee said there are fewer modern man-made attractions in Thailand than in developed nations. As more tourists travel independently, attractions face challenges in terms of access and transport from popular destinations.\nShe suggested they provide more activities to attract repeat visits, noting some museums and zoos hold special events in the evening.\nMr Wuthichai said many small operators lack funds to upgrade their services, suggesting government assistance through a budget for meetings, sightseeing or events, especially in untapped destinations. He said authorities should issue new investment regulations dedicated to theme parks, as privileges now favour the industrial sector, and theme parks require more time to generate a return.\nVisitors stroll the streets at Siam Amazing Park.\nA child explores Peranakan culture at Peranakan Phuket Museum.\nNew trends in theme parks are showcased at the IAAPA Expo Asia in Bangkok.\u2009Molpasorn Shoowong\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat type of condominium are you most interested in?\nStudio\n1-bedroom\n2-bedroom\n3-bedroom\nPenthouse\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nTourism\nAttractions\nMan-made\nThailand\nBusiness\nTravel\n\u0e18\u0e38\u0e23\u0e01\u0e34\u0e08\n\u0e17\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e40\u0e17\u0e35\u0e48\u0e22\u0e27\nDo you like the content of this article?\n15\n79\nCOMMENT\n(21)",

After finding support at 1,273 points early in the month, marking the month's low, the index broke above the upper end of the sideways trend of its two-month range (June-July), reaching the month's high of 1,370. Key factors affecting market movements include:\nFed rate cut signal: As the Federal Reserve meeting on Sept 17-18 approaches, chairman Jerome Powell's recent comments suggesting a possible interest rate cut have ignited speculation about the magnitude of the adjustment. A reduction of 50 basis points could indicate growing concerns about the potential for recession in the US economy.\nDomestic economic policies: The new government's stimulus measures are expected to support the economy. Areas of focus include investment promotion, agriculture and strengthening of small and medium-sized enterprises.\nChinese yuan carry trade: With the recent easing of the Japanese yen carry trade, investors are increasingly turning to the Chinese yuan for opportunities. Beijing's accommodative monetary policy has contributed to a stronger yuan, making it an attractive option for carry trade strategies. However, the near-term outlook for China's economy remains uncertain.\nGeopolitical tensions: While a resolution to conflicts between Iran and Israel and Israel and Hamas could have a positive impact on global equities, it could also lead to increased volatility in gold and crude oil prices.\nSEPTEMBER OUTLOOK\nWhile a short-term pullback in the Thai market is highly likely given the recent breach of the 1,350 support (which serves as a key support from October 2023 to November 2024), the SET index is expected to advance towards 1,400 and 1,430 if the 1,350 or 1,330 support levels hold.\nIn terms of investment strategy, focus on domestic plays, particularly retailers benefiting from the government's digital wallet scheme. Our stock picks for September are:\nIVL (Buy, target 21 baht): Net profit for the petrochemical producer is projected to rebound to 7.3 billion baht in 2025, recovering from a forecast loss of 18.7 billion in 2024. This estimate is based on an adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda) of US$106 a tonne and sales volume of 14.1-14.2 million tonnes in 2024-25 (compared with $99 and 13.9 million tonnes in 2023). Our target price is based on an enterprise value (EV) to Ebitda ratio of 6.45 times, which is 1.6 standard deviations (SD) below the five-year average.\nKTB (Buy, target 21 baht): Our target price for the bank reflects a 2024 price-to-book value (PBV) ratio of 0.68 times, which is 0.75 SD below the 10-year average. The current stock valuation of 0.63 times PBV offers a significant discount (-1.0 SD) compared with the historical average. Moreover, even the previous peak of 21 baht does not fully reflect the bank's quarterly record-breaking performance.\nMAGURO (Buy, target 21.40): Our target price for the restaurant operator is based on a 2025 core price/earnings (PE) ratio of 22 times. The current stock valuation of 17.8 times core PE is undervalued compared with peers' average of 19.7 times. MAGURO's lower penetration rate, strong earnings outlook and the recent bottoming out of earnings make it a compelling investment opportunity.\nNER (Buy, target 6.80 baht): We project 22% growth in core profit for the rubber producer in 2024, reaching 1.9 billion baht. This marks a turnaround in three years, supported by rising rubber prices, export growth and the acquisition of new customers. Our target price is based on a 2024 PE of 6.5 times (0.25 SD above the five-year average). Progress on the company's new plants in Thailand and C\u00f4te d'Ivoire could act as catalysts.\nSAV (Buy, target 26 baht): Our target price for the air traffic control firm is based on a discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation, assuming a weighted average cost of capital (WACC) of 8.2% and a terminal growth rate of 2.5%. The company's expansion plans into Laos and recent business related to airport equipment procurement could provide an upside to our earnings forecasts.\nSISB (Buy, target 40 baht): We estimate 2024 profit for the international school operator at 914 million baht, representing 35% year-on-year growth. This is based on our projected enrolment growth of 10% to 4,600 students and the annual 5% tuition fee increase. Our target price is based on a DCF valuation using a WACC of 7.2% and a terminal growth rate of 3%. Increasing student enrolments and annual tuition fee adjustments are expected to be key catalysts.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat type of hotel location do you prefer in Thailand?\nBeachfront resorts\nCity-center hotels (close to shopping, restaurants, attractions\nSecluded, nature retreats\nNear airports for convenience\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nThailand\nStocks\nInvestment\nDo you like the content of this article?\n1\n1\nCOMMENT",

Founded in 1844, the first Western medicine hospital in Shanghai, and one of the oldest in China, has increasingly become a sought-after destination for paediatric liver transplants.\nIn the past decade, dozens of foreign children, mainly from Malaysia, have undergone liver transplants at Renji, which is one of the world's largest medical centres for the highly complex and technically challenging procedure.\nRELATED\nbusiness\nPush for synbio tech to be widely applied\nbusiness\nSoutheast Asian durian growers shrug off threat of Chinese competition\n\"Boosting international medical tourism is now our top priority,\" explained the hospital's deputy director, Sun Yun.\n\"We're looking to bring what we're good at to more people abroad.\"\nBoasting China's biggest population of expatriates, as well as the most inbound tourists, Shanghai is seemingly ideal for such a programme.\nAnd the ambitious undertaking to carve out a piece of the multibillion-dollar global medical tourism market comes as the nation's healthcare system has fostered rapid innovation and technological development to serve the needs of 1.4 billion Chinese people.\nBut industry observers point out that the well-established standing among neighbouring regions could mean China has a long way to go.\nNonetheless, strides have been made across China's medical sectors in recent years.\nThe Boao township in the southern island province of Hainan, having opened a medical tourism pilot zone 11 years ago that now features dozens of institutions, has branded itself Hope City.\nAnd Shenzhen, just across the border from Hong Kong, has joined Shanghai in deploying more resources over the past year to attract medical tourists.\nShenzhen's plan, announced in April, aims to identify 10 hospitals as pilot facilities with standardised services to foster international medical tourism.\nThe city lured 770,000 tourists for medical services last year, mainly from Hong Kong and Macau, as quality improved, while prices were far lower than at private hospitals in neighbouring cities, according to Shenzhen health authorities.\nAnd a relatively small portion of patients came from the US, Canada and Japan, they said.\nThe value of the global medical tourism market, which includes healthcare, services and insurance, was estimated to be US$11.56 billion in 2020, and is expected to reach US$53.51 billion in 2028, according to market research firm Fortune Business Insights.\nPeople wait at a waiting area of a hospital in Shanghai, China. (File photo: Reuters)\nThe 13 designated hospitals in Shanghai treated nearly 270,000 foreign patients in 2023, and they are working on a set of detailed standards for international medical services that are expected to be unveiled later this year, city authorities said in May.\nNearly 20,000 non-Chinese citizens are received by Renji every year, with about 15% travelling from their home regions and the rest comprising mostly expats in Shanghai, according to the hospital's Sun.\nAnd she said most of those travellers are from Southeast Asian nations, as memorandums of understanding have been signed with hospitals in Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines.\n\"Shanghai's high-end medical market has huge room for development,\" Sun said.\n\"We're targeting medical tourists as we have already built a large foundation for general inbound tourism.\"\nThe city of nearly 25 million people received more than 3 million inbound tourists in the first half of this year - marking an increase of 143% year on year - as China extended its 144-hour free transit visa to 54 countries to lure talent and investors.\nShanghai's competitive advantage lies in its experienced doctors, who can treat complicated diseases, which differs from the strategy employed by neighbouring countries in their medical-tourism drives.\n\"Medical technology is definitely the most important thing [in attracting cross-border patients]. We've established a reputation that makes people think of Renji when it comes to liver transplants,\" Sun said.\nIn comparison, the Boao pilot zone in Hainan, approved by the State Council in 2013, has been exploring a wider range of areas, including specially licenced healthcare services, health management, rehabilitation care and anti\u2011ageing aesthetic medicine.\nWith 29 medical institutions operating in the zone, it received around 300,000 medical tourists last year, up by 60% from 2022, according to official data.\nHowever, cities in mainland China are still far from rivalling its neighbours in terms of attractiveness, as they have either built a reputation for quality service, such as Thailand, or at the lower end in terms of price, Taiwan.\n\"It seems likely that the combination of the Thai sector's determination to expand its offerings - into, for example, wellness - and the growing market for medical tourism, mean that the emergence of serious rivals need not be a great worry for Thailand,\" said Michael Montesano, an associate senior fellow specialising in Thailand at the Singapore-based ISEAS Yusof Ishak Research Institute.\n\"[Thai hospitals] bring the sort of hospitality for which the hotel business in Thailand is known [in terms of] reception of patients.\n\"This approach extends to nursing care, and the doctors who staff these hospitals speak English well and work with an appearance of real professionalism and often empathy.\"\nThailand's medical tourism sector ranked in the top five out of 46 countries based on \"destination attractiveness\" and cost, according to the International Healthcare Research Centre, an advocacy and research group.\nA medical room at a hospital. (File photo)\nSeoul resident Park Ji-won flagged language barriers when asked if she were willing to travel to China specifically for healthcare purposes.\n\"I believe Korea already has good medical services where everyone speaks Korean. So, I may go to a domestic hospital for a normal illness instead of one in China, which I lack knowledge of and has language problems,\" she said.\n\"But I may want to go on a traditional medicine tour, as I want to have a try and see the difference in traditional Chinese medicine services in Korea and China.\"\nSouth Korea already has a mature healthcare industry, with the medical tourism market valued at US$1.9 billion in 2023, and it is expected to reach US$3 billion by 2032, according to market research firm IMARC Group.\nSouth Korean officials see the sector as a \"major national industry\" and are working on medical, legal and policy strategies with a goal of attracting 700,000 foreign patients per year by 2027, scholars from two Korean universities said in a 2023 research paper.\nA record of more than 600,000 foreign patients arrived last year, the health ministry said, according to The Korea Times newspaper.\nRelatively high prices may also make people hesitant about travelling to China for medical services, according to analysts.\nParamitaningrum, an international relations lecturer at Bina Nusantara University in Jakarta, said Indonesians would only consider Shanghai or Guangzhou for serious illness, such as kidney problems.\n\"As far as I know, if the medical treatment can be done somewhere nearby, like in Penang [Malaysia] or Singapore, they prefer going to these two places, because they're close and cheaper than Shanghai,\" she said.\nTaiwan, which ventured into the medical tourism industry before mainland China, is another competitor for its cost-effective healthcare at \"competitive\" quality levels, according to Hu Jin-li, a professor with the Institute of Business and Management at the National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University in Taipei.\n\"Taiwan's advantage is that medical costs are much lower than those in neighbouring economies, such as Hong Kong, Japan and South Korea, while the medical quality in Taiwan is competitive with these economies,\" he said.\n\"Taiwan's large hospitals are equipped with advanced devices under efficient utilisation and quality controls. Moreover, Taiwan has convenient transport, communications [and] hotels.\"\nAbout 228,000 medical tourists received treatment in Taiwan last year, according to the government-backed Taiwan Task Force for Medical Travel.\nBut in Shanghai, despite Renji's early success, luring international travellers for healthcare remains difficult for some of the city's other hospitals involved in the pilot scheme.\nOnly two young patients, both from Europe, have been flown to Shanghai Children's Medical Centre - another of the 13 designated hospitals - for treatment since the city's initiative was launched in September last year.\n\"It's a trial, and it's still in a very early stage,\" said Cherry Jiang, who works in the hospital's publicity department.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhich app or platform do you usually use to book accommodations?\nBooking.com\nAgoda\nAirbnb\nTrip.com\nTraveloka\nExpedia\nSkyscanner\nDirectly with the accommodation\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nChina\nMedical tourism\nTourism\nThailand\nTaiwan\nUnited states\nHealth\nDo you like the content of this article?\n3\n10\nCOMMENT\n(8)",

(Reuters)\nLONDON - As two US aircraft carrier battle groups patrolled the Indian Ocean this week in an explicit effort to deter Iran from striking Israel and sparking a major regional conflict, a very different military messaging effort was underway in a luxury conference centre in Manila.&nbsp;\nThe 35th annual Military Law and Operations Conference organised by the US Indo-Pacific Command \u2013 running from Aug 27-30 \u2013 is held every year in a different country in the region \u2013 but its presence in the capital of the Philippines this week was likely far from a coincidence.\nSince late 2023, supply ships from the Philippines have had to run a gauntlet of Chinese patrol boats trying to block them from accessing the disputed Second Thomas Shoal, home to grounded Filipino landing craft the BRP Sierra Madre.\nADVERTISEMENT\nAds powered by\nIn June, a Filipino marine lost his thumb during a collision with a Chinese vessel in a violent face-off involving Chinese military personnel waving clubs and spears. More recently, a second and perhaps\nequally dangerous confrontation\nhas erupted over the nearby Sabina Shoal, where the largest ship in the Philippine Coast Guard, the BRP Teresa Magbauna, has been anchored since April.\nRELATED\nthailand\nMalaysian state\u2019s border wall proposal rejected\nworld\nPhilippine VP doubts she will survive impeachment\nThe last month has seen at least two collisions between Chinese patrol ships and&nbsp;Philippine&nbsp;vessels resupplying the Teresa Magbauna, while the&nbsp;Philippines&nbsp;has also accused Chinese aircraft of flying dangerously close to maritime patrol planes.\nAs the conference opened on Tuesday, the commander of the US Indo-Pacific Command, Admiral Samuel Paparo, said the US was now considering accompanying vessels from the&nbsp;Philippines&nbsp;to resupply both disputed shoals - a move that Beijing would almost certainly see as a major escalation.\n\"Escort of one vessel to the other is an entirely reasonable option within our Mutual Defence Treaty, among this close alliance between the two of us,\" Paparo told a joint press conference with&nbsp;Philippines&nbsp;General Romeo Brawner, referring to a 1951 treaty that commits Washington to supporting Manila in the event of an armed attack on its forces.\nBeijing\u2019s intent, officials in Washington and the&nbsp;Philippines&nbsp;both suspect, is to drive&nbsp;Philippines&nbsp;forces permanently - ideally this year - from both Second Thomas and Sabina Shoals by making it impossible for them to mount resupply missions.\nBoth Manila and Washington appear united in their determination that the&nbsp;Philippines&nbsp;should not be forced to abandon either shoal.\nPrevious eras might have seen an aircraft carrier pulled from its station on the far side of the world to show the flag in the South China Sea.\nIn these more contested times, the US effort might be rather smaller: perhaps a frigate or destroyer sailing alongside their Filipino counterparts, or even just using US helicopters to take supplies to the two beleaguered Filipino vessels.\nAccording to the independent US Naval Institute, the US amphibious assault ships Boxer and America are currently conducting exercises and operations off Japan and the&nbsp;Philippines&nbsp;respectively.\nCurrently, however, the US Navy does not have a single aircraft carrier anywhere in Asia, the first time that has been the case since 2001.\nUS officials say that is just a short-term situation \u2013 the previously Japan-based Nimitz-class USS Ronald Reagan is now being swapped for her sister ship George Washington, while aside from the two carriers in the Middle East, the others are engaged in refits or training on the US Atlantic or Pacific coasts.\nSetting precedent, perception\nThe Biden administration has gone out of its way to give the impression that it would respond militarily to any attack on Taiwan. However, Beijing would likely see a ready surrender of the two Filipino outposts in the South China Sea as a wider signal of weak US resolve.\nMost recently, the&nbsp;Philippines&nbsp;Coast Guard was forced to abandon a resupply run to Sabina Shoal on Monday after its vessels were intercepted aggressively by Chinese counterparts.\nOver the last decade, successive Manila governments have periodically announced deals with Beijing over access to Second Thomas Shoal, only for confrontations to resume shortly after.\n\"We can't afford to ignore this sort of thing, because eventually it sets precedent and shapes perception,\" said Samuel Byers, a former Pentagon official and now senior adviser at the Center for Maritime Strategy in Washington DC. \"That kind of sets the mindset of both allies and adversaries.\" US officials say they believe Chinese President Xi Jinping is still considering whether or not to use military force to invade Taiwan but has ordered his military to be prepared to do so by 2027.\nThe problem, Byers said, is that simultaneous crises elsewhere in the world \u2013 currently particularly the Middle East \u2013 are leaving US forces looking overstretched. US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin this week ordered the two US carriers already in the Middle East to extend their deployments further, described by a Pentagon spokesman as a \u201cclear signal\u201d the US stands behind the defence of Israel. That show of force seems to have been effective \u2013 on Wednesday, the chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, Air Force General Charles Brown, told Reuters both Iran and Israel appeared to have found \u201coff ramps\u201d from a face-off, which intensified sharply following the assassination of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran on July 31. In a measure of the need to make tough choices, however, Washington has scaled back forces it had kept in the Red Sea since late 2023, when the USS Eisenhower carrier battle group spent months knocking down drones and rockets fired from Yemen by Iran-backed Houthi militants. In the process, the battle group used up more Tomahawk land attack missiles than the US military purchased in the whole of 2023.\nThe Houthi attacks, however, have continued, with US warships now no longer nearby but instead in positions from which they can strike Iran directly in the event of any wider war. A smaller force of European warships remains to assist commercial vessels in the Red Sea, one of which \u2013 the Greek tanker MV Sounion \u2013 was this week reported ablaze and leaking oil, with salvage efforts complicated by threats of further attacks.\nLong time coming\nWith much merchant shipping now avoiding the Red Sea, the idea that the world\u2019s pre-eminent naval force, the US Navy, might largely abandon its campaign there would once have been unthinkable.\nThe fact it has done so points not just to the level of priority being given to deterring Iran from doing something rash, but also the feeling that the United States now faces a very different era. One obvious likely casualty is US support to Europe \u2013 in 2022 and 2023, US aircraft carriers joined exercises with NATO forces, but none has done so in the current year. US officials have become increasingly blunt that European nations should defend their own backyard, while Washington shifts its focus to the Pacific.\nWhat is most important, US officials say, is the growing \u201clatticework\u201d of alliances Washington has built in Asia, particularly tying Japan, South Korea, the&nbsp;Philippines&nbsp;and Australia.\nFor most of those countries, the confrontation with China has been a long time coming.\nOver the last two decades, China has built its own outposts on several disputed islands including a major military base on the&nbsp;Philippine-claimed Mischief Reef.\nMeanwhile, the fishing and patrol boats of its \u201cmaritime militia\u201d now routinely stop vessels from the&nbsp;Philippines&nbsp;and other foreign craft reaching the disputed Scarborough Shoal.\nA 2016 ruling by the United Nations maritime court in The Hague described much of the oil and energy-rich Spratly islands including Scarborough, Second Thomas and Sabina shoals as part of the&nbsp;Philippines&nbsp;Exclusive Economic Zone.\nThat ruling was angrily rejected by China, which says it holds jurisdiction over most of the South China Sea inside its \u201cnine dash line\u201d, which it says have long been historic Chinese waters despite being claimed by several other nations.\nSince November 2023,&nbsp;Philippine&nbsp;warships have conducted at least 10 bilateral and multilateral joint patrols with the United States, Canada, Australia and Japan, and with talk they might do the same with France.\nBut while such patrols have sometimes operated in contested areas, physically escorting Filipino ships into the teeth of a Chinese-enforced blockade would be a very different matter.\nAnd here is China state media's version of events:\nWhether the&nbsp;Philippines&nbsp;truly wants such a step is another question. Its military chief, General Brawner, has suggested joint patrols in the past, but appeared to pull back from that stance this week.\n\"The attitude of the armed forces of the Philippines...is for us to first rely on ourselves,\" he said. \"We are going to try all options, all avenues that are available to us in order for us to achieve the mission..., in this case, the resupply rotation of our troops. We will then seek other options when we are...constrained from doing it ourselves.\"\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat is your budget range for purchasing a condominium?\nEkkamai-Thong Lor\nSathorn-Silom\nChidlom-Siam\nBang Na\nChinatown\nAri\nRiverside\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nPhilippines\nChina\nSouth china sea\nUs\nDo you like the content of this article?\n32\n24\nCOMMENT\n(5)",

This firm later formed a joint venture with Thai conglomerate Charoen Pokphand (CP) Group to market the cars in Thailand.\nSAIC helps MG with global sourcing of automotive components, supply chain management and quality control, while new designs and technologies for the cars are determined by a team of engineers and designers in Birmingham.\nRELATED\nthailand\nTOAVH Restructures with Primus Group to Drive Growth\nthailand\nTOAVH Targets 11 Billion Baht Revenue, Expands into Green Business\n\"The growth of MG is not only based on the strong brand, but also our commitment to building a path to success through innovative car designs and performance to satisfy customer needs,\" said Mr Pongsak.\nCONTINUITY\nMG will continue to produce ICE-based cars despite tax cuts and government subsidy packages to stimulate the production and purchase of EVs, he said.\nThe EV incentive packages support Thailand's goal to become a regional hub of EV production.\nUnder its \"30@30\" policy, the country expects EVs to represent at least 30% of total motor vehicle production in Thailand by 2030, with production estimated at 725,000 zero-emission cars, 675,000 electric motorcycles and 34,000 electric buses and trucks.\nHowever, the Industry Ministry said earlier authorities will continue to support ICE car manufacturers that have operated businesses in Thailand for more than a decade.\nMG agrees with this government stance, said Mr Pongsak.\n\"Our factory will continue to produce ICE-powered cars,\" he said.\n\"Thailand has not yet transitioned its automotive industry fully to embrace 100% battery EVs [BEVs] because the existing auto facilities and the market are primarily tailored for ICE users.\"\nDuring the first half of 2024, ICE-powered cars posted the highest sales totalling 82,660 units in the passenger car category, followed by hybrid EVs (HEVs) at 67,110 units and BEVs 33,508, according to the Federation of Thai Industries (FTI).\nMost pickup buyers prefer ICE-based vehicles, said Mr Pongsak, indicating the popularity of this segment in the Thai market.\n\"If you look at the Thai economy, agriculture is an essential part and drivers in the farming sector use ICE-based vehicles,\" he said.\nA robotic arm manufactures an EV battery at an MG factory in Chon Buri.\nRISE OF HYBRID\nMG plans to invest in HEV manufacturing, believing this type of car will become more popular as the country promotes greater use of more environmentally friendly vehicles, said Mr Pongsak.\nHEVs seem to satisfy buyers' needs during the transition from ICE to electric mobility technology, he said.\nThe vehicles employ both ICE and batteries, so drivers need not worry about finding EV charging facilities.\nThe growing popularity of HEVs also results from the Board of Investment's (BoI) launch of incentive packages to promote the production of HEVs, said Mr Pongsak.\nManufacturers seeking a lower excise tax are required to invest at least 3 billion baht to produce HEVs domestically, according to the BoI.\nMG plans to make HEVs in Chon Buri where its car factory is located. The facility, located in the WHA Eastern Seaboard Industrial Estate 2, has annual production capacity of 100,000 cars, including BEVs and ICE-powered cars.\nAccording to the FTI, sales of HEVs soared by 69.6% for the first six months of 2024 year-on-year, compared with a 6.9% gain for BEVs.\nIn June alone, some 9,846 HEVs were sold, a year-on-year gain of 59.4%.\nBATTERY INVESTMENTS\nThe growing demand for HEVs does not mean BEVs will become less important in Thailand, as domestic manufacturing of the latter keeps growing via state incentive packages.\n\"The Thai automotive industry will see more BEV manufacturing plants next year, helping the country move towards its goal of becoming a regional EV production hub,\" said Mr Pongsak.\nThe increase is partly attributed to the impact of geopolitical conflicts, which caused entrepreneurs to consider relocating or expanding their businesses to Southeast Asia. Some of these entrepreneurs are Chinese automakers.\nMG, BYD and GWM, all from China, produce BEVs in Thailand. They sell BEVs domestically and use the country as an export base.\nHe said MG was among the first car companies to acknowledge the growth potential of Thailand's EV industry, investing 30 billion baht to bolster its EV business here over the past decade.\nMG has 150 showrooms in Thailand and a network of 150 EV charging stations to serve customers.\nDuring the first half this year, new registrations of all types of BEVs, including electric motorcycles, increased by 20.6% to 51,911 units, according to the FTI, citing statistics from the Department of Land Transport.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat type of condominium are you most interested in?\nStudio\n1-bedroom\n2-bedroom\n3-bedroom\nPenthouse\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nMG Sales\nPongsak Lertruedeewattanavong\nDo you like the content of this article?\n5\n11\nCOMMENT\n(6)",

Agricultural exports in July continued to increase, supporting farmers' income,\" noted ASPS.\nFor the non-bank group, the brokerage's stock picks are Muangthai Capital (MTC), Ngern Tid Lor (TIDLOR) and Srisawad Corporation (SAWAD).\nGloblex Securities recommends an investment strategy focusing on stocks that benefit from remedial work after the floods recede, including TIPCO Asphalt (TASCO), Dohome (DOHOME), Siam Global House (GLOBAL), Dynasty Ceramic (DCC), Diamond Building Products (DRT), TOA Paint Thailand (TOA) and Delta Paint (DPAINT).\nThe Transport Ministry is expected to propose 14 new megaprojects worth 798 billion baht to the new cabinet.\nThese projects include the Don Mueang tollway, Expressway No.9 (western Bangkok outer ring road expressway), double-track railway phase 2 and Thailand-China high-speed railway phase 2.

(Photo: Nutthawat Wichieanbut)\nChina's trading partners are once again fretting about the country's supposedly unfair economic practices. This time, the focus is on China's alleged attempt to export its excess capacity, especially in emerging sectors such as electric vehicles (EVs), and to undermine domestic industries in the United States and Europe.\nBut before the world embarks on the next round of retaliatory action against China, it is critical to understand the stubborn resilience of the Chinese export juggernaut. As my co-authors and I document in a recent paper, China's share of global exports has continued to soar despite other countries' more restrictive trade responses and domestic actions that should have corrected the imbalance. This paradox has serious policy implications.\nFrom the mid-1980s until the global financial crisis (GFC) of 2008, the ratio of China's imports to GDP more than doubled, from roughly 14% to around 33%. But China's current account balance (the excess of exports over imports) swung from a deficit of 4% of GDP to a surplus of nearly 10%.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThese two outcomes reflected China's opening to the outside world. A rising import-to-GDP ratio typically results from trade liberalisation, including the reduction of tariff and non-tariff barriers. China famously shed its inward orientation after Deng Xiaoping's reforms, culminating in the country's accession to the World Trade Organization in 2001.\nRELATED\nthailand\nDeeper Dive: What's behind Thailand's flooding?\nbusiness\nBourse unveils three flagship projects\nAt the same time, rising current-account surpluses can be traced to China's aggressive export-promotion strategy, which entailed the government keeping the economy closed to foreign capital inflows and the central bank buying surplus foreign currency to maintain a competitive exchange rate. As a result, foreign exchange reserves ballooned, peaking at US$4 trillion.\nTrade openness and aggressive mercantilism then contributed to a third outcome: China's steadily increasing share of global exports. In particular, its share of global manufacturing exports rose from less than 1% in 1985 to 12% by 2007, reaching astronomical levels of up to 50% in sectors such as apparel and footwear. In other words, trade and other policies produced faster manufacturing-sector productivity growth in China compared to the rest of the world.\nChina's rising exports and current-account surpluses provoked anxiety in America and elsewhere, triggering a series of policy responses. First, facing pressure from the US, China began allowing the renminbi to appreciate against the dollar right before the GFC. It strengthened by around 50% over a decade, and the country's current account surplus fell from a peak of 10% of GDP in 2006 to virtually zero in 2018.\nSecond, China embarked on a massive stimulus in the years after the GFC, financing a real estate and infrastructure boom. This shift in public spending tilted the composition of output towards non-tradables. Third, under President Xi Jinping, China started turning inward, emphasising \"localisation\" and \"internal circulation\", which aimed to restrict foreign competition. Lastly, the US under former president Donald Trump hiked tariffs against China, a strategy that President Joe Biden has pursued even more aggressively.\nThese measures -- a large and sustained currency appreciation, ambitious government spending, and aggressive protectionist measures -- should have undermined China's competitiveness. It makes intuitive sense that a stronger renminbi and America's protectionist turn should have reduced China's exports. And in more subtle but no less important ways, Chinese protectionism and stimulus should have had the same effect.\nThe collapse of imports after the GFC should have impeded export competitiveness, according to the economist Abba Lerner's view that \"an import tax is an export tax\". And the relative boom in non-tradables caused by the stimulus should have undermined the competitiveness of the tradable sector because of rising wages and price inflation domestically (also known as the Balassa-Samuelson effect). But none of this happened. The march of the Chinese export juggernaut has been relentless, with China's share of global manufacturing exports jumping from 12% around the GFC to 22% by 2022.\nNow, China's current account surplus is soaring again (despite being obscured by flawed data, as Brad Setser of the Council on Foreign Relations has shown), and its currency is weakening. Pressure is mounting on the US and Europe to take retaliatory action.\nBut the first step should be understanding this paradox of China's globalisation, namely, why exports have defied the corrective effects of conventional policy levers. For example, China may be massively subsidising its exports, but in an unconventional or concealed manner. Or it could be that Chinese firms have been very efficient, especially in mastering new technologies in sectors such as EVs. The US and Europe should be discussing these issues with China, tailoring responses to the underlying diagnosis, rather than taking knee-jerk protectionist measures that serve only to stoke tensions.\n\u00a92024 Project Syndicate\nArvind Subramanian, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics and former chief economic adviser to the Indian government, is the author of 'Of Counsel: The Challenges of the Modi-Jaitley Economy' (India Viking, 2018).\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWould you consider buying a house in a gated community or as a standalone property?\nGated community\nStandalone house\nEither, depending on location and price\nNo preference\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nChina\nTrade\nDo you like the content of this article?\n5\n13\nCOMMENT\n(3)",

And the prospect of additional supply chain disruptions to food imports is undeniably alarming for governments. While some like the Philippines import more than 25%, others like Singapore import over 90%.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe food security of Southeast Asia and that of Northeast Asia is linked. Figures for food import dependence in Northeast Asia for key agricultural products are even more alarming. For instance, Japan, which imports about 62% of its food, relies on imports for wheat (83%), soybeans (78%) and edible oils (97%).\nRELATED\nopinion\nUniting against cyber-scam gangs\nbusiness\nCar firms warned of new Australia rule\nBoosting domestic agricultural production seems like the obvious answer. Yet the severity of challenges that countries face (like land and water constraints) cannot be solved overnight. Instead, a regional approach is needed.\nSome steps have already been undertaken. Notably, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Plus Three Emergency Rice Reserve (Asean APTERR) with China, Japan and South Korea provides a collective rice reserve for use in emergencies or natural disasters. However, the current environment shows that stronger measures, drawing on leading food-producing partners like Australia, are needed.\nTo achieve this, Asean, Australia and New Zealand could jointly form an Asean Plus Five collective emergency reserves and food-sharing platform. The inclusion of Australia and New Zealand -- dual agricultural powerhouses and exporters -- could create a food-sharing platform of about 2.2 billion people across 15 countries. Doing so would bring together leading food exporters and the major importers.\nAustralia and New Zealand are leading exporters of grains, dairy, meat and oilseeds. The former is the world's biggest sheep and mutton exporter and supplies over 13% of global wheat exports. A leading beef and barley exporter, Australia also exports more modest quantities of oilseeds (like canola).\nNew Zealand, for its part, is the world's biggest dairy exporter and second-largest global lamb and mutton exporter. It is also a major beef exporter.\nSoutheast and Northeast Asian countries are major importers and consumers of these agricultural products. For instance, during the 2022\u20132023 marketing year, most Australian wheat was exported to China (a record 6.4 million tonnes) and Indonesia (3.49 million tonnes). Other leading buyers included Vietnam (2.38 million tonnes), South Korea (2.26 million tonnes) and the Philippines (2.22 million tonnes).\nFood demands in the region will continue rising due to growing populations, expanding middle classes and higher incomes. This will further strain current food production and trade. Yet increasing demands are unlikely to be met by Asian agricultural producers/exporters alone.\nAustralia and New Zealand are well-placed to help. Participating in the proposed Asean mechanism could turn them into the region's much-needed \"food bowl\", boosting exports and intra-regional trade.\nThere are other benefits for Canberra and Wellington. Stronger economic ties reflect the governments' interests in Asia, including pivots to Southeast Asia. For Canberra in particular, the security and prosperity of both Australia and Southeast Asia are interlinked, as the Southeast Asia Economic Strategy to 2040 points out.\nHowever, challenges lie ahead. Aside from lingering tensions between China and Australia and tensions in hotspots like the South China Sea, other concerns like climate shocks and natural resource competition, which exacerbate food inflation and damage agricultural production, should be noted.\nBroader concerns about the viability of and resilience in the Australia-Asean partnership as well as Australia's bilateral relations with states in Southeast Asia and Northeast Asia should be considered too. In recent years, Canberra's food export policies at times have raised the ire of its trading partners.\nNotably, in 2011, Australia imposed a temporary six-month ban on live cattle exports to Indonesia following the release of footage showing animal cruelty in Indonesian abattoirs. This move was a pivotal moment in Australia's agricultural and diplomatic relations with Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia, which is a key importer of Australian livestock.\nThe temporary ban and sudden loss of a key export market also had significant economic repercussions for Australian stakeholders including farmers and exporters through the adverse impact on economic activity and cash flows. Estimates at the time of the ban suggested that the suspension of all live cattle exports to Indonesia could cost the industry as much as AU$320 million (7.3 billion baht).\nOn the diplomatic front, the ban strained Australia-Indonesia relations. Indonesian officials condemned the decision, viewing it as an interference in their domestic affairs and economic interests.\nThe live export dispute between Australia and Indonesia was later resolved through negotiations and commitments to improve animal welfare standards.\nAustralia learned significant lessons from this episode. In particular, the dispute helped Australian policymakers better understand local conditions and the importance of working in consultation and collaboration with Southeast Asian partners.\nFor any food security grouping to work, Australia must also consider potential challenges with Northeast Asian partners. For instance, its barley trade with China has been marred by significant disputes. The most prominent occurred in 2020 when China imposed 80.5% anti-dumping tariffs on barley imports, effectively blocking exports to the Chinese market. China's Ministry of Commerce claimed that Australian barley was being sold at unfairly low prices, which they argued harmed the domestic barley industry in China.\nThe tariffs impacted the Australian barley industry. Between 2014 and 2015 and 2018 and 2019, Australian barley exports to China averaged approximately AU$1.2 billion a year. However, Australian farmers and exporters were forced to find alternative markets such as Saudi Arabia and Vietnam. Concurrently, the average value of barley exports dropped from AU$407 per ton in 2019\u201320 to AU$310 per ton in 2020\u201321.\nSince the lifting of the tariffs in August last year by Beijing, however, the overwhelming majority of Australian barley exports -- 78% -- have been exported to China.\nTo help restore trust with Beijing, Canberra may engage in sustained diplomatic dialogue. Establishing regular high-level meetings between trade representatives could help address misunderstandings as well as provide a platform for resolving food import/export-related disputes within the proposed Asean Plus Five mechanism.\nAmid an increasingly fractured geopolitical environment, stronger intra-regional trading and wider emergency food reserves could support greater regional stability and resilience to transnational challenges.\nAnd there is a need to do so -- food is too important to leave off the region's policy menu.\nGenevieve Donnellon-May is an independent researcher.

She is the daughter of former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra.\nThis has heightened concerns over Thailand's political stability and cast a shadow over the country's economic outlook, which already faces numerous challenges.\nPOLICIES IN FOCUS\nADVERTISEMENT\nAmonthep Chawla, chief economist at CIMB Thai Bank, said the political transition is occurring rapidly, following the dismissal of former premier Srettha Thavisin on Wednesday.\n\"From now on, attention should focus on monitoring the new government's policies,\" he said.\nRELATED\nthailand\nSoutheast Asia\u2019s First Nintendo Authorised Store Opens&nbsp;\nopinion\nMaking the solidarity levies case\n\"I anticipate the new administration may cancel the digital wallet scheme and is likely to introduce new stimulus measures aimed at supporting lower-income individuals and enhancing liquidity in vulnerable segments of the population.\"\nHowever, the establishment of a new government may delay the approval of the fiscal 2025 budget, though this is not expected to have a significant impact on the economy, said Mr Amonthep.\nFor the remainder of this year, external factors, particularly the slowdown in key global economies such as the US and China, could pose downside risks, he said.\n\"The new government should be prepared to address the potential challenges of a global economic slowdown, which could adversely affect the Thai economy,\" said Mr Amonthep.\nVorapol Sokatiyanurak, an economist and former secretary-general of the Securities and Exchange Commission, said the new prime minister, who is coming into office according to democratic principles, is believed to have a certain level of capability.\nHowever, he said the new premier would face significant challenges, particularly on economic issues, making it was necessary to assemble a team to assist her.\nAccording to Mr Vorapol, Ms Paetongtarn must address Thailand's declining competitiveness, as local industries are lagging because the country does not have a strategy for industrial development.\nHe said the lack of development of skilled personnel, especially in science and technology, is preventing Thailand from producing goods the modern world demands.\nThe household debt level is another urgent task for the new premier to tackle, said Mr Vorapol. Household debt in Thailand exceeds 16.3 trillion baht as of the fourth quarter last year, which represents 91.3% of GDP.\nThailand needs to reduce monopolistic practices and bolster small and medium-sized enterprises, which would help increase income levels, he said. Debt problems can be addressed through higher incomes, said Mr Vorapol.\nYuthasak Supasorn, board chairman of the Industrial Estate Authority of Thailand (IEAT), said he believes a government led by Ms Paetongtarn should raise hopes the government's key policies will remain intact, which will help to improve the Thai economy.\nThese policies include the government's push for investments in targeted S-curve industries in the Eastern Economic Corridor (EEC) and the controversial policy to develop the Land Bridge megaproject.\nThe former is aimed at making the EEC, which covers parts of Chon Buri, Rayong and Chachoengsao, the country's high-tech industrial hub, while the latter aims to build a logistics network connecting Ranong on the Andaman Sea to Chumphon on the Gulf of Thailand.\nDespite the change in government, Mr Yuthasak said it should not cause a significant negative impact to investor confidence because the authorities have launched many measures to promote investment.\nThe latest measure is the IEAT's investment promotion campaign called \"Now Thailand\", which is expected to boost investment via the development of industrial estates.\nKriengkrai Thiennukul, chairman of the Federation of Thai Industries, said he was not surprised after learning Ms Paetongtarn was elected prime minister.\nHe wants to see whether the government will launch new stimulus measures to help the economy, which remains stagnant this year.\nIMPROVED SENTIMENT\nRatasak Piriyanont, senior vice-president of macro strategies at Kasikorn Securities, said the stock market reacted positively to the news, with investors hoping many of the current economic policies would continue.\nInvestors were encouraged by the quick and smooth process that identified a new premier after the Constitutional Court disqualified Mr Srettha and his cabinet from office, he said.\n\"Ms Paetongtarn's background is in the private sector, with her company involved in the property, hotel and tourism-related industry, so she has an understanding of the business sector and the economy,\" Mr Ratasak said.\nThe mother of two helped run the hotel arm of the family's business empire before entering politics in late 2022.\n\"The hospitality business has recently become a key driver of the Thai economy,\" he said.\n\"Ms Paetongtarn's expertise could help support the growth of this industry to drive the economy going forward.\"\nRakpong Chaisuparakul, senior vice-president at KGI Securities (Thailand), had a similar view, noting that investors seem to be optimistic regarding the rapid formation of a coalition government if Ms Paetongtarn is endorsed as the country's new premier.\n\"It looks like construction of the new cabinet will be quick, meaning downside risks to economic growth are limited,\" said Mr Rakpong.\nKGI believes the new cabinet may focus on consumption stimulus that is more conventional and easier to access, he said.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat type of condominium are you most interested in?\nStudio\n1-bedroom\n2-bedroom\n3-bedroom\nPenthouse\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nBusiness leaders\nEconomic policies\nPaetongtarn\nDo you like the content of this article?\n33\n320\nCOMMENT\n(103)",

The company reported a remarkable net profit increase of 973%, or 10 times the previous amount, driven primarily by its international business. CP Foods also announced an interim dividend payment of THB 0.45 per share.\nCP Foods reported sales revenue for Q2/2024 amounting to THB 149,498 million, with 64% of total revenue coming from its overseas operations, 30% from its Thai businesses, and 6% from exports out of Thailand. Net profit reached THB 6,925 million in Q2 this year, reflecting a 973% increase compared to Q2 last year. This substantial growth was mainly attributed to an improved gross profit margin and increased share of profit from associates and joint ventures.&nbsp;\nThe primary factor contributing to the improved gross profit margin, which reached approximately 15% this year, was the reduced cost of animal husbandry, driven by lower raw material costs. Enhanced production efficiency and cost management, along with higher global pig prices, particularly in Vietnam and Cambodia following the rebalancing of production volume after an oversupply of meat and the recent ASF epidemic, also played a significant role.&nbsp;\nADVERTISEMENT\nProfit from associates and joint ventures totalled THB 3,352 million, marking a 475% increase. This was largely due to the better performance of associates in the animal feed and pig businesses in the People's Republic of China, where pig prices were higher than in the same period last year. Additionally, CP ALL Public Company Limited's improved performance contributed to the overall profit increase.&nbsp;\nPrasit Boondoungprasert, Chief Executive Officer of CP Foods, stated that the improved performance represents a recovery of the company's business back to normal after a challenging year marked by increased costs and a meat glut in several countries. The company has been focused on closely monitoring market conditions, analysing consumer behaviour, and optimising efficiency across all processes. These efforts have enabled CP Foods to maintain competitive costs and produce products at prices that consumers can afford.&nbsp;\nThe better-than-expected performance in the second quarter was driven by strong results from overseas operations, particularly in Vietnam and Cambodia, as well as improved performance from the joint venture in the animal feed and pig business in China. Enhanced farming efficiency led to lower overall costs, coupled with higher pig prices compared to the previous year.&nbsp;\nLooking ahead to the second half of the year, the company recognises the ongoing challenges posed by economic conditions and geopolitical conflicts. As a result, CP Foods remains cautious in its investments and continues to develop sustainable innovations to enhance competitiveness. The company is also preparing to adjust its trade strategies to adapt to evolving consumer behaviour. Furthermore, CP Foods remains fully committed to its Net-Zero goal by 2050.&nbsp;\nThe Board of Directors of CP Foods has approved the payment of an interim dividend for the first half of this year at THB 0.45 per share, representing 46% of net profit for the first six months of 2024. The Record Date is set for 30 August (XD on 29 August), and the dividend payment date is scheduled for 13 September 2024.&nbsp;\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nHow important are environmental sustainability practices (e.g., eco-friendly rooms, waste reduction) when choosing accommodation in Thailand?

The company expanded into Thailand in 2019, just before the pandemic. Like many businesses, YouTrip was affected by global lockdowns, but recorded a significant recovery with the reopening.\nADVERTISEMENT\nWith the resumption of offshore travel in 2022, the company posted growth based on pent-up demand from the pandemic period. Growth was particularly strong last year, driven by operations in Singapore and Thailand.\nIn 2023, YouTrip acquired millions of users across the region and showcased robust business metrics, achieving 180% revenue growth year-on-year and reaching profitability goals. The company recorded a total payment volume of around US$10 billion, or 350 billon baht.\nRELATED\nbusiness\nAsian equities track Wall Street higher\nthailand\nKBank revolutionises the forex market, daring to be the first bank to offer the best rate ever\nThe exact number of users, revenue and net profit figures were not disclosed.\nGiven the robust growth, in October 2023 YouTrip raised $50 million (1.84 billion baht) in a Series B fundraising round led by new investors and global venture capital firm Lightspeed. This raised YouTrip's total funds to more than $100 million, or 3.68 billion baht, since its inception.\nIn the first half of 2024, YouTrip reported 80% growth in spending via its platform year-on-year, driven by markets in Singapore and Thailand in the travel, e-commerce and insurance categories.\nAs the fastest-growing multi-currency payment platform in Southeast Asia, YouTrip was listed among the world's top fintech companies by Singapore-based CNBC in 2024.\n\"We expect 100% revenue growth this year. We already hit our target for the first half of the year and foresee a positive outlook for the second half as well,\" Ms Juthasree said.\nPositive Momentum\nWith the global tourism recovery and improving outbound travel from Thailand, YouTrip has shown significant momentum in the Thai market, she said.\nAs of June this year, new users in Thailand tripled and transaction volume increased fivefold compared with the past two years, said Ms Juthasree.\n\"During Songkran this year, YouTrip users' spending increased by 150% year-on-year, demonstrating the recovery in travel and spending after the lockdown,\" she said.\nDuring the Songkran festival, China is a key destination for Thais. Transaction volume of Thai travelers spending in China via YouTrip increased by 466% in Chinese yuan in April this year, said Ms Juthasree.\nShe highlighted greater business opportunities in the Thai market, with plans for growth in the coming years.\nThe company aims to develop new innovative services and payment solutions through strategic partnerships.\nIn Thailand, YouTrip partners with Kasikornbank to offer financial services and plans to collaborate with other business partners to strengthen the ecosystem and localise services to meet the needs of Thai users, said Ms Juthasree.\nRegional Expansion\nShe said the company plans to start operations in Malaysia this year, following approval from regulators there. Under its localisation strategy, YouTrip will partner with local businesses to expand in Southeast Asia, said Ms Juthasree.\nYouTrip is awaiting regulatory approvals to operate in three more regional markets considered to have high growth potential, but she did not disclose the countries.\nMs Juthasree anticipates intensified competition in the digital payment arena, covering travel cards, cross-border fund transfers, and multi-currency payment solutions from banks, non-banks and fintech firms.\nThe rise in outbound travel and the continued traction of digital payments present greater opportunities for related digital payment businesses, she said.\nThe company remains confident in its position, thanks to tailored product offerings that meet local demand, said Ms Juthasree. YouTrip's focus on user experience, transparency and security positions it well to navigate the evolving travel payment industry landscape, she said.\n\"We are not overly concerned about increased competition,\" said Ms Juthasree.\n\"We currently compete with several peers, including major global players. However, we will monitor the market and handle competition appropriately.\"\nBusiness challenges\nShe said the economic outlook presents a significant challenge for YouTrip's business operations and growth on global, regional and local levels. A softer growth trajectory for the global and Thai economies could affect spending via YouTrip.\nAs a result, users are prioritising their payments according to their lifestyles. For instance, some users may prioritise spending on their destination rather than on accommodation or dining to save costs on their trips, said Ms Juthasree.\nYouTrip's users range from 12 to 60 years old and can sign up using only an ID card. High-spending users, typically aged 20-30, tend to focus on tourism, she said.\nMs Juthasree said the company's service partially overlaps with credit cards, particularly in the area of overseas payments, and is disrupting the traditional plastic card industry.\nThe main advantages of YouTrip over traditional payment solutions include no transaction fees, no dynamic currency conversion fees and reasonable exchange rates, she said.\nYouTrip prioritises providing a seamless and secure user experience, emphasising transparency, real-time notifications, 24/7 customer support, and robust fraud protection mechanisms to build trust among users, said Ms Juthasree.\nThe company also recognises the importance of tailoring its offerings to the specific needs of each market, exploring contactless payment methods and expanding its complementary offerings, such as travel insurance, flights, accommodation and experience partnerships, she said.\nFor Thailand, Ms Juthasree said the emergence of virtual banks is unlikely to intensify competition significantly because existing banks already offer digital banking services.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhich app or platform do you usually use to book accommodations?\nBooking.com\nAgoda\nAirbnb\nTrip.com\nTraveloka\nExpedia\nSkyscanner\nDirectly with the accommodation\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nYouTrip\nJuthasree Kuvinichkul\nDo you like the content of this article?\n2\n9\nCOMMENT\n(2)",

The bank aims to expand its total corporate loan portfolio to 100 billion baht in 2024, following an increase in loans outstanding to 90 billion baht in 2023, up from 80 billion baht in 2022.\nDue to the good asset quality of the corporate customer segment, CIMBT has successfully controlled non-performing corporate loans to a satisfactory level of around 1.7%, down from around 2% at the end of last year.\nM Wut highlighted the strengths of each regional market under CIMB Group's strategy. In Thailand, potential industries include tourism, healthcare, logistics, and data centres. Both foreign and large Thai corporations see opportunities for mergers and acquisitions in regional markets, with portfolio investment being a key strategy for local companies seeking investment returns in overseas markets.\n\"Despite Thailand's GDP growth being lower than its regional peers, the country remains attractive for FDI as foreign investors use Thailand as a production base for re-exports,\" he said.\nAccording to CIMBT Research Center, global FDI declined to US$1.3 trillion in 2023, a 2% year-on-year decrease, due to the worldwide economic slowdown and increased geopolitical tensions. However, FDI to Asean rose to $226 billion, a 1% increase.\nSingapore ranks first in Asean for attracting FDI, followed by Indonesia, Vietnam, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand since the start of the year. This indicates a continued shift of production bases to regional countries.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat type of condominium are you most interested in?\nStudio\n1-bedroom\n2-bedroom\n3-bedroom\nPenthouse\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nCimbt\nInvestment\nChina\nAsean\nDo you like the content of this article?\n12\n37\nCOMMENT\n(6)",

Many local sellers have relied on these platforms to sell their products and face additional service fee increases.\nThe value of Thailand's e-commerce market is expected to reach nearly 700 billion baht in 2024, up from a projected 634 billion in 2023.\nADVERTISEMENT\nOver the past five years, representatives of Thailand's e-commerce industry have urged the government to take action against ultra-cheap imported products to create fair competition for local manufacturers.\nTemu, which is owned by PDD Holdings, sells a variety of products, many of which are manufactured at low cost in China. Temu's popularity has grown since its launch in September 2022, as has the competition with incumbent e-commerce platforms in the United States and other countries.\nRELATED\nbusiness\nVietnam says Temu, Shein must register with govt or be blocked in country\nbusiness\nAmazon's plan to tackle Temu, Shein? Sell more toothpaste\nTemu describes itself as a marketplace that connects consumers directly with third-party manufacturers, which reduces intermediaries and associated costs.\nEMERGING THREAT\nSimon Torring, co-founder of Cube Asia, a company providing market insights on e-commerce in Southeast Asia, said Temu's entry into Thailand initially presents a limited challenge to the existing e-commerce platforms but it could become a more serious threat to them in the future.\nHe added that Temu has expanded into new markets at a rapid pace over the past 12 months. Following its launch in Thailand, the platform is now available in more than 70 markets worldwide. The platform has become a major player in many of these markets, due to its aggressive branding, heavy investments in digital marketing, and its amazing deals -- mainly on unbranded Chinese-made goods.\nIts playbook, which has worked particularly well in developed markets such as the US and Western Europe, will likely also be deployed in Thailand, Mr Torring said.\nThailand is the third market Temu has entered into in Southeast Asia, having established a presence in the Philippines and Malaysia almost a year ago. Temu enjoys high-user awareness and high application download rates in those two markets. However, so far it has only gained a limited market share in those countries from the more established players such as Shopee, Lazada and TikTok Shop.\n\"A big reason for this limited success is that Southeast Asia's e-commerce platforms already provide a wide range of cheap Chinese goods, for example through Shopee's and Lazada's cross-border offerings. In this sense, while Temu has some novelty power, its value proposition is less of a game-changer in Southeast Asia than it is elsewhere,\" said Mr Torring.\nTemu is expected to broaden its offering by including goods from well-known brands to further expand its market share in the region, he added.\nIMPACTING EVERY MARKET\nPaul Srivorakul, group chief executive of aCommerce, an e-commerce enabler, said Temu's entry into the Thai market will fuel fiercer competition among online retailers. The other platforms will have to develop offerings and strategies to compete with Temu's group buying and marketplace models.\nGroup buying refers to a model that allows a number of consumers to purchase goods and services in bulk at reduced prices, so that both the consumer and vendor can benefit from these transactions.\n\"This situation is already happening in the US and impacting players such as Amazon as well as offline retailers like dollar stores. The cross-border and import tariffs will have some impact on Temu, but it will be willing to subsidise prices even further to win the market,\" said Mr Paul.\nThailand recently slapped a 7% value-added tax (VAT) on imported goods worth one baht or more. Previously goods sold for less than 1,500 baht per packet and imported into Thailand were exempted from VAT.\nMr Paul said brands would need to adjust their e-commerce strategies as the market will be flooded with new products across new channels that will take a share from existing retail and distribution models.\nMr Paul cited a US research study that suggests the presence of Temu impacts local offline retailers, particularly when it comes to low-cost items sold by local small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), chain stores, and street stalls.\nThe presence of Shopee and Tiktok Shop has already significantly impacted Lazada and local retailers. Temu's entrance will be like adding fuel to the fire, Mr Paul noted.\nHe said Temu leverages artificial intelligence (AI) and gamification to develop addictive retailing and merchandising strategies. The pricing strategy and product promotions are designed to trigger specific psychological responses among consumers to encourage them to continuously shop using game-like elements to enhance the shopping experience, he added.\nThe logo of Temu can be seen on the screen of a mobile phone in an illustration displayed on the company's website. REUTERS\nMr Paul said Temu's global annual advertising budget of US$3 billion has set a high benchmark for digital marketing efforts. Its aggressive ad spend may make other marketplaces become more competitive, driving up online marketing costs for everyone and drowning out local online retailers who are already struggling to remain top-of-mind with consumers.\nLocal players will need to evaluate their marketing strategies and budgets to compete with such substantial marketing investments. Google, Facebook and Line will benefit from Temu's ad spend at the global and regional levels.\nRULES ARE RULES\nVisanu Vongsinsirikul, secretary-general of the Trade Competition Commission (TCCT), said the commission would consider whether Temu's practice of offering cheap products should be subject to the country's anti-dumping rules.\nThailand's Trade Competition Act covers products sold at less than cost in an effort to eliminate competitors or create price pressure, forcing partners or suppliers to lower their costs.\n\"If any sellers show signs of such behaviour, we can enforce our law. In cases where these sellers lack a local presence, Section 58 of the law stipulates that if foreign operators collaborate with local business partners and harm the local economy, it may constitute a violation of the law,\" Mr Visanu said.\nMr Visanu also noted that private operators need to submit details of the cost structure for anti-dumping investigations.\n\"We require clear and specific information to conduct further investigations,\" he added.\nChaichana Mitrpant, executive director of the Electronic Transactions Development Agency (ETDA), said the ETDA had developed a \"recommendation standard\" for digital platforms across various industries, covering over 100 items.\nThe recommendation comes under the Commerce Ministry and is aimed at defining standards and sharing data of products that have certified standards. The recommendation standard is awaiting approval before being put before a public hearing.\nHe said that to govern digital platforms, collaboration is required among many state agencies. For example, the TCCT on matters pertaining to laws concerning competition, the Revenue Department when it comes to corporate tax and VAT, and the Customs Department for customs-related tax matters.\nMr Apichit said the Federation of Thai Industries has asked the relevant authorities to implement additional new measures to cope with the importation of a large quantity of ultra-cheap products from China.\nADDITIONAL STEPS REQUIRED\nApichit Prasoprat, vice-chairman of the Federation of Thai Industries (FTI), said the federation has asked the relevant authorities to implement additional new measures to cope with the large number of imported products from China.\nMore factories may shutter if the government fails to deal with the influx of cheap products from China, which is thought to be on the rise following the entry of Chinese online retailers into the Thai market, he added.\nThe high level of competition as the result of the importation of low-cost Chinese products is expected to intensify, causing local manufacturers, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), to consider exiting the market, as Temu has vowed to provide discounts of up to 90% on products sold on its platform, said Mr Apichit.\nThe federation is conducting a survey to see how many SMEs will be affected and what kinds of business they are carrying out. An initial survey found around half of 46 industries under the FTI are struggling to deal with the flood of cheap products from China.\n\"Some entrepreneurs decided to adjust their businesses by shifting from being manufacturers to being importers of products, mainly from China,\" said Mr Apichit.\nThe Commerce Ministry noted that if Thai manufacturers are hurt by the influx of cheap Chinese goods, the government has anti-dumping measures and regulations in place to review the import tax rates on the types of goods that are now affecting Thai SMEs.\nVuttikrai Leewiraphan, commerce permanent secretary, said the emergence of the Temu platform would allow people to have direct access to cheap products made in Chinese factories. This would pose a detrimental impact to those SMEs acting as middlemen that import products from China.\nFurthermore, original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) would also be affected as consumers would opt for Chinese products which are much cheaper, forcing SMEs to lower the price of their products, resulting in a reduction in their profits.\nMr Vuttikrai said the government should implement measures to protect local businesses from the influx of cheap Chinese goods, especially via e-commerce platforms. This could be achieved by enforcing anti-dumping and anti-circumvention measures, imposing tariffs on Chinese imports and beefing up customs inspections of imported goods.\nMoreover, the quality of imported products is crucial as many products purchased online lack adherence to standards and are often packaged, making it difficult for consumers to inspect them.\nMeasures are required to certify the standard of such products, Mr Vuttikrai said.\nThe Revenue Department stipulates that e-commerce platforms need to set up \"electronic special accounts\" that report the revenue and business information of their online merchants, effective as of Jan 1 this year.\n\"Consumer protection laws must be improved to cover e-commerce and penalties increased for violations of consumer rights or the sale of substandard products. These measures would help create a fair environment for competition, protect local producers, and improve consumer trust and confidence,\" Mr Vuttikrai said.\nTIE-UP ON THE HORIZON\nThailand Post president Dhanant Subhadrabandhu said the entry of Temu into the Thai market could impact all related parties, but especially online and offline retailers due to the Chinese company's competitive pricing strategy and unique business offerings.\nMr Dhanant said Thailand Post is monitoring Temu's actions. The state-run logistics provider is eager to seek a way to connect with Temu via a logistics partnership model, as it had already done with several other e-commerce and social platforms.\nMr Dhanant said Thailand Post has to collaborate with all platforms to ensure its substantial revenue stream.\nThailand Post recently disclosed that it is ready to establish a joint venture with a huge Chinese logistics company early next year to boost the volume of its logistics transactions between China and the domestic market as well as from the domestic market to China.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nHow important are environmental sustainability practices (e.g., eco-friendly rooms, waste reduction) when choosing accommodation in Thailand?

Indonesia will be close behind with 5.7% growth.\nIn Thailand, positive drivers are the tourism rebound, a key regional automotive hub with well-connected infrastructure, and the fact that leading major Thai conglomerates, namely Charoen Pokphand (CP), Central Group, PTT, Siam Cement and Thai Union are more regional than their Southeast Asian peers, the report noted.\nADVERTISEMENT\nHowever, negative factors remain in terms of an uncertain and turbulent political landscape, concerns over consolidation in key sectors including retail and telecommunications, and the demographic challenge, it notes.\n\"Southeast Asia is likely to outpace China GDP and foreign direct investment [FDI] growth over the next decade,\" said the report, released by the Angsana Council, Bain &amp; Company and DBS Bank.\nRELATED\nthailand\nAt least 3 killed, scores injured in grenade attack at Tak fair\nthailand\nCommission fears low turnout in polls\nLast year, FDI in the six Asean economies covered amounted to US$206 billion, while China recorded $43 billion.

Or is it a defined concept, a geographical configuration, a channel for connectivity, and/or a confining strategy? Perhaps it embodies an all-embracing blend, waiting for the onlooker to dive deep into political undercurrents. It may also be time to move beyond the landscape and the seascape and even leave the dreamscape behind.\nThe reason for waking up is that many countries and regions are now invoking that term directly to coalesce with others in the march towards the future. Obviously, they are all shaped by some vested interests, at times egoistic, at times utilitarian, and at times Darwinian. Yet, to some, the term itself remains vague. To others, it may simply signify a containment coalition against the seepage of a major Asian power with a very established history.\nThe two most prominent strategies on the issue are those of the US and of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean). The former's approach is based upon its Indo-Pacific Strategy 2022. In essence, it posits a free and open Indo-Pacific, propelling the prosperity and security of that configuration. It aims to drive new resources into the region, foster an economic and connectivity framework, and reinforce deterrence. It mentions various partners, particularly Asean, Japan, the Republic of Korea (South Korea), and India. It advocates substantive cooperation by the four-country alliance in the form of the Quad -- US, Australia, Japan, and India. One of the original aims was to address the Covid-19 pandemic, but it is now acting as an implied platform for cooperation on maritime and other security matters, potentially vis a vis that major Asian power.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe Asean way is slightly different. It is less about containment and more about equilibrium-building, with Asean as the (claimed) \"honest broker\" between the world powers contesting in the region. It posits, as usual, Asean's centrality as its raison d'etre. Emerging in 2019, the Asean Outlook for the Indo-Pacific responds to the \"geopolitical and geostrategic shifts\" by shaping a broadened architecture, expanding its various initiatives such as the East Asia Summit (EAS), Asean Regional Forum, and Asean defence ministers' meetings, for Indo-Pacific cooperation. It seeks to promote connectivity between the Asia-Pacific and Indo-Pacific not as separate but as interconnected and closely integrated regions. It underlines development and prosperity, incorporating into the context the maritime vistas for cooperation.\nRELATED\nworld\nUS, Japan, Philippine conduct maritime exercises in South China Sea\nworld\nTrump claims 'powerful mandate' after Fox News projects victory\nIt voices rules-based openness and inclusivity. It harks back to the UN Charter, the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, the Asean Charter, the Asean Treaty of Amity and Cooperation, and the EAS Principles for Mutually Beneficial Relations. Even though individual Asean members may be facing a conflict with a major power in the South China Sea, Asean as an organisation still seeks to engage in a balancing act that is unaligned.\nIn expanding its coverage from the Pacific to the \"Indo-setting\", what are the key areas for its outlook? Maritime cooperation is an essential component; this includes safety and security at sea, such as to counter piracy and transnational crimes. It advocates the implementation of sustainable development goals and measures to counter marine pollution, as well as to address sea-level rise, biodiversity and green shipping. The older agenda remains -- in particular, to adopt a code of conduct on the South China Sea.\nIts accent on connectivity targets cross-links with digital portals, the private sector's role, and outreach to regional groupings such as the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (Bimstec) and Mekong sub-regional cooperation frameworks, including the Ayeyawady-Chao Phraya-Mekong Economic Cooperation Strategy. It is not confined to the seascape or landscape, as it reaches up to the sky, intending to establish a \"Seamless Asean Sky\" for more liberal air travel.\nYet, it takes two or more to tango, and there arises the question -- what do other Indo-Pacific stakeholders think of these initiatives? This is especially pertinent to the \"Indo\" part of the equation, which is relatively new to the strategies above. What about India and the West Asian-East African oceanic rim?\nIndia's approach is, in a manner, multi-directional in that it has cooperated actively with the West Asian-East African region, such as on anti-piracy measures and maritime security. It also has a free trade agreement with Asean. While it is now a member of the Quad, it has to deal with its big neighbour (to the north) astutely, as there are, at times, border issues of a bilateral kind. It has enjoyed good relations with another major power which now has a war on its hands. India is also a member of Brics -- originally formed by Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa, as a counterweight to the DDB (dollarised, developed bloc). While its traditional domain was the Indian Ocean rim reaching down to Southern Africa, its more recent orientation to look eastwards (from the Indian sub-continent) to establish closer ties with Asean and the Pacific framework is organically a natural development. However, this is not unqualified, as seen by its hesitancy in joining the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership grouping.\nOn another front, the Indian Ocean Rim Association (Iora) comes to mind as a more catalytic regional actor for the future. It has nearly 25 members; they include key African states, some South and West Asian states, and some Asean countries. Global powers are also its dialogue partners. This organisation adopted the Iora Outlook for the Indo-Pacific in 2022 to engage with countries with that configuration. This would include maritime safety and security, trade and investment facilitation, fisheries management, and disaster risk management. In 2023, auspiciously, it signed a memorandum of understanding with Asean, anchored on both the Asean and Iora Outlooks.\n\"Blue economy\" is very much at the heart of that engagement. This would cover many maritime matters, inevitably protecting the marine environment, incentivising people-to-people links, and promoting inter-intra-regional trade. This correlates aptly with the agenda of another regional grouping at the other end of the Pacific -- the Pacific Island states. The latter has now adopted its 2050 Strategy for the Blue Pacific Continent -- for a peaceful, safe and secure region.\nThat oceanic colour may be flagged as the basis for future cooperation, with green representing environmental protection as an intergenerational concern. Beyond the dreamscape and transcending conflicts with fuller commitment, the Indo-Pacific may thus become a reality -- even as a \"zone of shared opportunities.\"\nVitit Muntarbhorn\nChulalongkorn University Professor\nVitit Muntarbhorn is a Professor Emeritus at the Faculty of Law, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand.

Historically, Thailand's GDP has grown as high as 5-6%,\" said Mr Pichai.\nADVERTISEMENT\n\"I wish to see Thailand's current real GDP growth at 3.5%.\"\nHe said an appropriate inflation rate for Thailand should be at least 2%, noting that in some countries with policies promoting high economic growth, inflation of 2.5% is acceptable.\nRELATED\nworld\nKorean lawmakers try again to impeach president\nbusiness\nMinister in no hurry to appoint new central bank chairman\nMr Pichai said over the past decade, Thailand's economic growth has been relatively low.\nFrom the pandemic years of 2020-2021 until now, average economic growth has been only 0.4%.\nLast year growth was 1.9%, and this year it is forecast to be 2.7%.\nOver the past 10 years, Thailand's manufacturing sector, especially small businesses, have dwindled.\nDuring certain periods, the utilisation rate dropped as low as 50%, while the prices of goods have also decreased, he said.\n\"We have to choose. Do we want lower prices for goods, but not much money to buy things? Or do we want higher prices for goods, but more money in consumers' pockets?\" said Mr Pichai.\nHe said he prefers economic growth to austerity measures.\nTo drive economic growth, Mr Pichai said it is essential to promote domestic investment. The country's liquidity is sufficient to support investment, but investment levels have sagged in recent years, he said.\n\"We have become a country that is financially stable, but has low investment, resembling a wealthy individual without a future,\" said Mr Pichai.\nHe said the direction of Thailand's investment should align with global trends, such as digital and the green economy, as well as efforts to develop human skills.\nAt the CEO Econmass Awards 2024, Mr Pichai made the case for economic growth and higher inflation.\nAccording to Mr Pichai, for 2023 and this year, Board of Investment applications submitted and approved total 2 trillion baht, the highest level in a decade.\nOne investment promotion policy this government will push is amending the leasehold asset law, extending land lease agreements up to 99 years from the current 30 years, he said.\nMr Pichai said the effort aims to provide foreign investors with confidence in long-term investments that are worthwhile, offering land rights that allow foreigners to sell them or use them as collateral for loans from financial institutions.\nIf Thai private entities wish to sell land to foreigners, this can be done, but the approach requires the private sector to first transfer land ownership to the state, then the leasehold asset law gives foreigners the right to utilise the land under a 99-year lease agreement, he said.\nMr Pichai insisted investment stimulus requires infrastructure investment, especially in logistics. Logistics costs account for 18% of Thai GDP.\nHe said an important project is the Land Bridge, which seeks to create a transport hub between two oceans, specifically targeting the shipment of goods to and from China by reducing costs.\nHOPEFUL YEAR\nThe Joint Standing Committee on Commerce, Industry and Banking (JSCCIB), which joined an economic forum at the same event, echoed the ministry's GDP growth outlook for 2025, believing it will be driven by tourism, government stimulus measures and an improving global economy.\nThe group expects Thai GDP growth of 3.5-4% next year, with improving trade bolstering Thai exports, a significant contributor to GDP.\n\"The JSCCIB hopes geopolitical conflicts will not turn more severe, affecting the Thai economy,\" said Kriengkrai Thiennukul, chairman of the Federation of Thai Industries.\nAs tourism continues to recover, foreign tourist arrivals should reach 40 million next year, up from a target of 36 million this year, he said.\nPayong Srivanich, chairman of the Thai Bankers' Association, warned prolonged high levels of household debt threaten to affect the 2025 economy.\n\"Household debt will weaken people's purchasing power and economic growth,\" he said.\nThe Thai economy should grow by 3% this year, but severe flooding in the North dealt a blow to the economy, reducing it to a gain of 2.6-2.7%, said Sanan Angubolkul, chairman of the Thai Chamber of Commerce.\nHe said he supports the government effort to seek membership in BRICS, a grouping comprising Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa.\nBRICS is working on a new payment system to reduce their reliance on the US dollar.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat is your preferred price range per night for accommodation in Bangkok?\n1,000 - 3,000 THB\n3,000 - 5,000 THB\n5,000 - 8,000 THB\nOver 8,000 THB\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nFinance Ministry\nEconomic growth\nCEO Econmass Awards 2024\nDo you like the content of this article?\n5\n90\nCOMMENT\n(20)",

The 16th annual Brics Summit in Kazan, Russia, set the stage for the gathering of what's essentially the \"Alternative economic club\" to the established Western groups such as the G-7 and the IMF. Thirty-five 35 delegations, including 24 heads of state and government, journeyed to Kazan for a three-day summit and schmooze session with the otherwise diplomatically isolated Russian president.\nMr Putin set the tone for the group to become a powerful economic bloc, or at least try to sound that way, as well as countering the reality that Russia faces isolation from the global economy.\nKazan, deep in the steppes of Russia and 804km east of Moscow and part of the nominal Muslim Republic of Tatarstan, was chosen to showcase Russia's image between West and East and friend of the Global South. This historic city on the Volga, Kazan, has a mixed population of Muslim and Orthodox Russians.\nADVERTISEMENT\nLet's face it: An economic grouping of Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa holds clout in geographic size, resources, population, and production, at least on paper. Just this year, Brics admitted new members: Egypt, Ethiopia, and Iran.\nRELATED\nworld\nAustralia passes social media ban for under-16s\nopinion\nThe world's babies need antibiotics\nWhat hurts the group remains corruption, weak institutions and even political tensions among its partners, such as the long-time China/India border dispute. Conversely, Russia, China, and India form a crucial land mass that holds significant economic clout.\nWhen the group was founded in 2006, many hailed it as a realistic alternative to what's deemed as Western-oriented economic/financial institutions. The Brics present themselves as the alternative to Western organisations and are thus increasingly attuned to the Global South, aka former Third World.\nWithout question, Beijing dominates Brics if only for size and economic standing, one of the world's largest economies. China's communist leader, Xi Jinping, beamed in the glow of the Summit as much as did India's capitalist Prime Minister, Narendra Modi. Mr Putin approved.\nBut Brics is more about politics and posturing than classic economics. The Russian president clearly views the group as a political tool as well as a safe haven for Moscow's policy aspirations even in the aftermath of his Ukraine invasion.\n\"For Putin, the summit is the most important foreign policy event of the year, and he wants to use it to present himself on the world stage as a leader who is not internationally isolated but who, with the Brics states, represents the future 'world majority'\" states Germany's respected Friedrich Naumann Foundation for Freedom.\nThe surprise visit of UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres created bad optics for him, given the setting and international situation. Though his visit was politically slammed by Ukraine, it does the UN no good to be seen mingling with Mr Putin, a person with an arrest warrant from the International Criminal Court. As curiously, Mr Guterres spent Oct 24, historically commemorated as UN Day, in a country which currently is violating the territorial integrity of another UN member state, Ukraine, thus breaking international law.\nTo his credit, Mr Guterres's speech challenged Moscow's narrative, \"We need peace in Ukraine. A just peace in line with the UN Charter, International law and General Assembly resolutions.\"\nIran's new membership in Brics is surprising; a heavily sanctioned regime savours political legitimacy. But Iran's petroleum economy is on the upswing, with over 1.8 million barrels of oil sold per day, mostly to China. Why? Though facing suffocating economic sanctions under former President Trump, the Biden/Harris Administration has often waived tough sanctions enforcement on Tehran. Thus, Iran has much more cash to support its Mideast proxies, such as Hamas and Hezbollah, and has a better economic standing.\nInterestingly, Turkish President Erdogan is vying for Brics membership; should he be accepted, they would become the first Nato member. Conversely, Argentina's free market President, Javier Milei, withdrew his country from the group last year.\nA major Brics focus is to study using alternatives to the US dollar for global trade. Russia has stressed the promotion and development of alternative financial instruments and clearing systems in order to minimise dependence on Western currencies and the SWIFT system.\nSomehow, I don't feel that many countries, even among the Brics, will substitute using the rouble, the real, the rand, the rupee or the yuan to largely replace the US dollar anytime soon for major commercial transactions.\nBut take note. Brice represents an erosion of the post-war Western-based economic order.\nJohn J Metzler is a United Nations correspondent covering diplomatic and defense issues.

Apichart Jinakul\nThe Gold Research Center (GRC) expects\ngold prices\nto continue to rise this week, driven by three key supporting factors: the ongoing crisis in the Middle East, expectations surrounding the Bank of Japan's (BoJ) monetary policy meeting, and persistent weakness in US economic indicators.\nThe GRC Gold Survey indicates that domestic gold prices are projected to increase this week, contrary to the views of many gold experts who predict stability or a decrease.\nAs reported by the Gold Traders Association last week, the domestic price of 96.5% gold bars fluctuated between 42,750 and 44,000 baht per one-baht weight (15.1 grammes), closing at 43,700 baht on Friday, an increase of 1,150 baht over the previous week.\nADVERTISEMENT\nKey factors to watch this week include the Middle East conflict. The situation in Gaza may ease following US Secretary of State Antony Blinken's recent visit, during which he urged Israel to avoid escalating tensions with Iran and to seek a ceasefire with Hamas and Hezbollah, especially as the US presidential elections approach.\nMoreover, the BoJ's monetary policy meeting this week is significant, with Kazuo Ueda, governor of the BoJ, indicating that the bank still has time to consider additional monetary policies while signalling no immediate interest rate hikes, despite the yen recently falling to its lowest level in nearly three months.\nRELATED\nsports\nEkanit returns as Thais aim for victory\nthailand\nGovt 'won't mess with military'\nAdditionally, important US economic data will be released, including private employment figures from Automatic Data Processing, non-farm payrolls, the unemployment rate, and average hourly earnings for October 2024. These figures will provide further insights into the US economic outlook.\nLocal trader Hua Seng Heng noted that gold prices reached an all-time high last week due to strong buying interest stemming from escalating tensions in the Middle East.\nOn Saturday morning, Israel conducted missile strikes on Iran, although Iran later confirmed that its nuclear facility remained unharmed.\nMeanwhile, Brics (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) member states are working on a new payment system to reduce their reliance on the US dollar. The SPDR Gold Trust, the world's largest gold fund, also acquired 1.15 tonnes of gold over the past week.\nDomestic gold bar prices are expected to continue rising, driven by global trends and the weakening of the baht, which is moving in line with regional currencies affected by the strong dollar. The research house suggests investors holding gold should consider maintaining their positions to maximise profits.\nAs of the market opening on Monday, domestic gold prices remained stable, with gold ornaments priced at 44,100 baht per baht weight and gold bars priced at 43,700 baht per baht weight -- slightly lower than last week's all-time high of 44,000 baht. At the same time, the baht was trading at around 33.81 baht per dollar.\nOn the global front, the spot market gold price on Oct 28 stood at about US$2,732 per ounce, a decline from last week's peak of $2,749 per ounce.\nHua Seng Heng predicts that the global gold price will find support at $2,720 per ounce and face resistance at $2,758 per ounce this week.\nFor domestic 96.5% gold bars, support is anticipated at 43,450 baht, with resistance at 43,900 baht.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat is your budget range for renting a condominium?\nUnder 10,000 THB/month\n10,000 - 20,000 THB/month\n20,000 - 40,000 THB/month\n40,000 - 60,000 THB/month\nOver 60,000 THB/month\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nThailand\nGold price\nDo you like the content of this article?\n19\n7\nCOMMENT",

(Photo: Reuters)\nWASHINGTON: Low growth, high debt and escalating wars topped the official agenda at the International Monetary Fund and World Bank annual meetings, but finance leaders spent much of their energy worrying about the potential impacts of a return of Donald Trump to power in November's US presidential election.\nRepublican candidate Trump's gains in recent polls to erase much of the early advantage of his Democratic opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, was part of nearly every conversation among finance officials, central bankers and civil society groups attending the meetings in Washington this past week.\nAmong concerns were Trump's potential to upend the global finance system with massive tariff increases, trillions of dollars more in debt issuance and a reversal of work to fight climate change in favour of more fossil fuel energy production.\nADVERTISEMENT\n\"Everyone seemed to worry about the high uncertainty on who would become the next president, and what policies would be taken under the new president,\" Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda said.\nAnother central banker, speaking on condition of anonymity, described the concerns more bluntly: \"It's starting to feel like Trump is going to win.\"\nRELATED\nbusiness\nSET predicts more Chinese, US interest\nbusiness\nJitta Wealth promotes US stocks for the coming year\nTrump has vowed to impose a 10% tariff on imports from all countries, and 60% duties on imports from China. These would hit supply chains throughout the world, likely triggering retaliation and raising costs.\nGerman Finance Minister Christian Lindner told Reuters on Friday that there would only be losers in a US-EU trade war.\nTrump has also sought to entice US voters with offers of numerous tax breaks, from extension of all 2017 individual tax cuts to exempting income from tips, overtime pay and Social Security retirement benefits. Budget analysts say this would add at least another $7.5 trillion in new US debt over a decade, on top of the $22 trillion in debt growth previously estimated by the Congressional Budget Office through 2034.\nA Harris victory, by contrast, is being viewed by finance officials as a continuation of President Joe Biden's re-engagement in multilateral cooperation over the past four years on climate, corporate taxes, debt relief and development bank reforms. Her plans also are likely to increase debt, but far less than Trump's.\nBiden kept in place Trump's previous tariffs on imports of steel, aluminum and Chinese goods - raising them steeply on Chinese imports in new industries such as electric vehicles and solar. Harris has endorsed this \"targeted\" approach and has slammed Trump's broad tariff plans as a $4,000 consumer tax on American families.\nMarkets bet on trump\nFinancial markets are seeing a return of \"Trump trades\" in assets from stocks to bitcoin to the Mexican peso that bet in favour of a Trump victory as his poll numbers have improved.\nThe dollar has staged its biggest monthly gain in over two-and-a-half years, with an index measuring the greenback against major currencies up 3.6% in October so far. Standard Chartered analyst Steve Englander attributed 60% of the dollar's move upward to Trump's improved prospects in betting markets.\nBrazil's central bank chief Roberto Campos Neto said that the pro-Trump market bets were already having an inflationary impact on long-term interest rate futures in the dollar-sensitive economy, adding that both Trump's and Harris' fiscal plans had inflationary elements.\nThe worries about a Trump about-face on trade and spending arose as the IMF declared that the global battle against inflation had largely been won without major job losses, as US strength was offsetting weakness in China and Europe.\nIMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva urged policymakers to start shrinking a massive pile of Covid-induced debt or face a low-growth future that would leave populations increasingly dissatisfied.\nAsked about how the spectre of a Trump return impacted the meetings and IMF policy advice, Georgieva said the discussions had focused on solving the economic problems at hand.\n\"The sentiment of the membership is that elections are for the American people,\" Georgieva told a news conference. \"What is for us to identify is what are the challenges and how the IMF can constructively address these challenges.\"\nEmerging strains\nThe Federal Reserve's bumper half-point rate cut should normally signal a \"Goldilocks\" moment for emerging-market growth as financing conditions and inflationary currency pressures ease.\nBut bigger US deficits under a Trump presidency already have some worried that the party could end quickly.\n\"A larger deficit means growing debt, growing debt means higher long-term rates and that may mean also a strong US dollar,\" Turkish Finance Minister Mehmet Simsek said during an event on the sidelines of the meeting.\n\"High long-term interest rates in the US and a strong dollar don't serve emerging markets well,\" he said.\nConcerns of a tit-for-tat global trade war stalling an easing of inflation pressures were rife.\n\"If one country imposes tariffs, it's assuming that the other countries will not respond in that manner - (but) if the other countries respond by imposing tariffs around the world and thus you have elevated prices, the disinflationary process could become challenging for the world's central banks,\" said Lesetja Kganyago, South Africa's central bank governor.\nThe chair of the IMF's steering committee, Saudi Arabian Finance Minister Mohammed Al-Jadaan, emphasised past cooperation with Republican and Democratic US administrations, including Trump's, saying \"we just need to make sure that we continue that dialogue.\" That was a sentiment echoed by others at the meetings.\n\"I think we managed to deal with so many things, Covid and geopolitical tensions and everything,\" said Angolan Finance Minister Vera Daves de Sousa. \"Every challenge is an opportunity for us to reorganise ourselves to learn to deal with it.\"\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat type of condominium are you most interested in?\nStudio\n1-bedroom\n2-bedroom\n3-bedroom\nPenthouse\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nTrump\nUs election\nHarris\nTrade\nEconomy\nDo you like the content of this article?\n17\n18\nCOMMENT\n(52)",

(Photo: Reuters)\nTransport and industrial estate stocks are expected to benefit if Donald Trump wins the US presidential election, while manufacturers of petrochemicals, electrical equipment, steel products and auto parts could see competition intensify from Chinese exports, says Asia Plus Securities (ASPS).\nWith less than a month before the US vote on Nov 5, Democrat Kamala Harris and Republican Mr Trump are in a neck-and-neck race.\nThere are signals that former president Mr Trump may win the election, as he leads Ms Harris in some polls, ASPS said in a research note.\nADVERTISEMENT\n\"Protectionism against China is one of Mr Trump's flagship policies,\" the brokerage noted, adding a Bank of Thailand study found exports to the US increased during Mr Trump's presidency from 2017-20, replacing Chinese products that faced higher tariffs, especially for machinery, communication equipment and computers.\n\"However, Thailand's exports to other countries may be affected by fiercer competition with China, especially for export of goods subject to US protectionist policies, such as petrochemicals, electric appliances, steel products and auto parts,\" according to ASPS.\nRELATED\nopinion\nNo more bailouts\nbusiness\nSET predicts more Chinese, US interest\nShipping companies, such as Regional Container Lines (RCL), Precious Shipping (PSL) and Thoresen Thai Agencies (TTA), will benefit from this move as shipping orders would spike before a tariff hike takes effect, noted the brokerage.\nIn addition, more international firms will open factories outside China to avoid tax barriers, benefiting industrial estate operators including Amata Corporation (AMATA) and WHA Corporation (WHA), ASPS added.\nMaybank Securities (Thailand) expects the US election will create positive sentiment for the Thai government to drive the economy by providing a relaxed investment atmosphere to attract manufacturers from abroad.\nMaybank estimates the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) index has a chance to accelerate towards the end of the year, finishing at 1,520 points by year-end.\n\"The US election is a positive factor boosting the SET, regardless of the outcome. However, the Thai stock market would respond more positively if Ms Harris wins, as the party's trade and foreign policy are not as aggressive as Mr Trump,\" noted Maybank.\nAccording to the brokerage, statistics show the most important factor driving the Thai stock market during a US election year is the main investment trend in that year.\n\"For this year, the key trend is the downward interest rate cycle and the recovery of the domestic economy,\" noted Maybank.\n\"Based on these themes, interesting stocks are companies in the tourism, banking, construction materials, power plants and industrial estate sectors.\"\nMaybank recommends three stocks, comprising Asset World Corp (AWC), Global Power Synergy (GPSC) and WHA.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nIf you were to buy real estate in Thailand outside of Bangkok, which area would be your top choice?\nChiang Mai\nPhuket\nPattaya\nKhao Yai\nKoh Samui\nHua Hin\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nStock\nUS presidential election\nShare\nSecurities\nInvestment\nAnalysts\nTrump\nThailand trade\nEconomy\nDo you like the content of this article?\n2\n10\nCOMMENT\n(1)",

The remainder is the \"satellite portfolio\", comprising short-term investments, according to the brokerage.\n\"Multi-asset portfolios are more resilient than other asset classes,\" said Mr Win.\nHe said K-Asset targets growth of its assets under management from 1.5 trillion baht to 2 trillion in three years.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat factor most influences your decision to choose a hotel or resort?\nPrice and discounts\nHotel reviews and ratings\nProximity to attractions\nHotel loyalty programs (e.g., points, rewards)\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nInvestment\nUS\nChina\nEconomic recovery\nGeopolitical\nConflict\nDo you like the content of this article?\n3\n1\nCOMMENT",

The financial cooperation between Thailand and Hong Kong promises mutual benefits, as Asean, Hong Kong and China are increasingly interconnected through trade and investment,\" he said.\nADVERTISEMENT\nAccording to Mr Paopoom, in a move to advance the country's goal of becoming a financial centre, the Finance Ministry is committed to reforming financial regulations to make them more flexible, transparent and conducive to business operations as well as providing new incentives, including both tax and non-tax benefits.\nThe ministry has also vowed to develop a modern financial ecosystem and infrastructure to support business and financial innovation.\nRELATED\nworld\nHow a country\u2019s economy was looted dry by politicians\nthailand\nThai Union\u2019s Strategy 2030 Eyes USD 7 Billion Revenue&nbsp;\nMr Paopoom said both parties also praised the success of cross-border payment system cooperation, particularly the integration of Thailand's PromptPay with Hong Kong's Faster Payment System.

Most Thais see their nation as part of a dynamic and rising region, and they believe Thailand needs to increase international cooperation and play a more active global role in addressing emerging challenges.\nThese insights come from a survey by the Asia Foundation, \"Thai Public Views on International Issues\", released last week. The survey was the first to examine Thai public opinion on foreign policy and international affairs.\nThe survey was conducted nationwide from July to November 2023, during an important political transition as the new civilian elected government -- a Pheu Thai-led coalition -- took power and pledged a more proactive diplomatic approach.\nADVERTISEMENT\nPrime Minister Srettha Thavisin reiterated that Thailand is committed to multilateralism and respect for human rights. The new administration said it would also promote foreign trade and attract direct foreign investment under economic-centered diplomacy.\nRELATED\nopinion\nRe-energising Thai-US relations\nlife\nGrim realities\nThe researchers interviewed 1,650 urban Thai adults across all regions, finding that a high percentage were knowledgeable about international issues, allowing for more in-depth questioning.\nInterestingly, the survey found that the urban Thai population is nearly evenly split in the direction of the country.\nHalf believe Thailand is headed in the wrong direction compared to 46% who see it as moving in the right direction. Younger respondents were particularly pessimistic, with 67% saying Thailand is on the wrong track.\nHowever, four out of five Thais believe Southeast Asia as a whole is heading in a positive direction, and an overwhelming 97% see Asean membership as beneficial for the country. Around half would like Thailand to take on a greater regional leadership role.\nOn the roles of the US and China, the Thai public generally views both countries as having a similar, largely positive impact on peace and security in Asia.\nThey believe the two powers do more good than harm for regional stability, with their economic ties and educational links seen as more valuable than military or governance influence.\nA clear majority of 66% see China as the most influential country in Asia today, far outpacing the 22% who view the US as the most influential.\nHowever, Thais anticipate that the US and China will remain the two most important countries in Thailand's future, with 72% expecting China to be the dominant power in the next decade compared to only 15% for the US.\nMost Thais want to maintain positive relations with both superpowers, avoiding siding with either, though 19% would like Thailand to align more closely with one or the other. When asked about a potential US-China armed conflict, 86% of Thais preferred neutrality rather than taking a side.\nSignificantly, well-informed Thai respondents view China and the US as generally benign or friendly, with 52% seeing China as friendly to Thailand, compared to 33% who view it as exploitative -- a net positive gap of 19 percentage points. The US has a similar 17-point net positive advantage, with 44% seeing it as friendly versus 27% as exploitative.\nAmong those Thais who want their country to become a close partner of China or the US, there is a slight preference for China. However, younger Thais who choose a side tend to favour aligning with the US.\nThe survey also revealed Thai public sentiment towards regional issues, particularly the Myanmar crisis. While foreign experts often view the Myanmar situation as a top priority for Thailand, only 2% of Thai respondents share this view, and just 9% believe Thailand should prioritise helping Myanmar refugees.\nHowever, most Thais support Thailand's deepening economic ties with Myanmar, Cambodia, and Laos, and 20% want the government to assist migrants from these neighbouring countries.\nNotably, Thai respondents view Cambodia, Myanmar, and Russia negatively. Cambodia and Myanmar have significant net negative gaps of 23 and 21 percentage points, respectively, regarding being seen as exploitative rather than friendly.\nRussia has a smaller 4-point net negative gap, with 45% of Thais viewing it as neutral. The rest of Asean countries and dialogue partners are seen as friendly.\nThe survey also asked the respondents about the new government's highest priorities for Thai foreign policy. Most identified economic growth and national security, followed by the air/haze situation and climate change.\nThe survey found that a slight majority of 54% are dissatisfied with the state of Thai democracy, particularly among younger citizens at 59%. Yet Thais overwhelmingly see democracy as the best form of governance, with 90% of youth and 84% overall believing it is \"always the best way\".\nWhen asked if Western countries like the US and Europe can do more to promote democracy and human rights in Thailand, most respondents agreed, with 71% of young people and 66% overall in favour. It is also important to note that older Thais were slightly less likely to agree, at 63%.\nWhile older Thais are more sceptical about external influences on Thai democracy, a plurality, though not a majority, believe such influences can be beneficial. In contrast, younger Thais tend to view external democratic support more positively.\nThe survey also observed that changes in Thailand's foreign policy and regional leadership would be highly consequential for mainland Southeast Asia, Asean, and geopolitics more broadly.\nAs the region's second-largest economy and the geographic centre of the Mekong subregion, Thailand routinely influences the security, migration, energy, and economic integration of neighbouring countries.\nThis 54-page survey report provides invaluable insights for policymakers and other stakeholders seeking to understand Thai public sentiment on foreign policy and regional cooperation issues.

(Photo: Reuters)\nSINGAPORE - As Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese Premier Li Qiang wrapped up separate meetings in Southeast Asia this week, the two partners in the Brics economic bloc encountered a region keen to join a group seen as a hedge against Western-led institutions.\nDuring an interview with Chinese media ahead of Li's visit to Malaysia, Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim declared his intention to apply to the bloc after it doubled in size this year by luring Global South nations \u2014 partly by offering access to financing but also by providing a political venue independent of Washington's influence.&nbsp;\nThailand \u2014 a US treaty ally \u2014 last month announced its own bid to join Brics, named after members Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa. The bloc \"represents a south-south cooperative framework which Thailand has long desired to be a part of,\" Foreign Affairs Minister Maris Sangiampongsa told reporters last week.\nOpinion:&nbsp;\nThailand's Brics move is misguided\nADVERTISEMENT\nAds powered by\nFor countries seeking to mitigate the economic risks of intensifying US-China competition, joining Brics is an attempt to straddle some of those tensions. In Southeast Asia, many nations depend economically on trade with China while also simultaneously welcoming the security presence and investment Washington provides.\nRELATED\nopinion\nRebel win to reshape Syria's fragile future\nproperty\nForeigners drive Phuket condo segment\nBut Brics membership is also a way of signalling increasing frustration with the US-led international order and key institutions that remain firmly in the control of Western powers, like the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF).\n\"Some of us, including people like myself, think that we need to find solutions to the unfair international financial and economic architecture,\" former Malaysian Foreign Minister Saifuddin Abdullah said in an interview. \"So, Brics would probably be one of the ways to balance some things.\"\nUkraine summit\nFor Putin and Chinese leader Xi Jinping, the interest in Brics also shows their success at pushing back at attempts by the United States and its allies to isolate them more broadly over the war in Ukraine and military threats to Taiwan, the Philippines, South Korea and Japan.&nbsp;\nUkraine leader Volodymyr Zelenskiy struggled to convince Asian nations to back his peace summit in Switzerland earlier this month, and\nPutin this week signed a defence pact with North Korea\nwhile warning he had the right to arm US adversaries around the world.\nIn this pool photograph distributed by the Russian state agency Sputnik, two guards stand underneath portraits of Russian President Vladimir Putin, left, and North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un during a welcome ceremony at Kim Il Sung Square in Pyongyang on Wednesday.\nA club that for years consisted of just five members expanded with the inclusion of Iran, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Ethiopia and Egypt this January. That was a push largely driven by China as it tries to increase its clout on the global stage.\nAnother Southeast Asian nation, Indonesia, was considered an early favourite to join last year before President Joko Widodo indicated he would not be rushed into the decision.\nStill, the momentum to add new members has continued. Despite US and European efforts to prevent countries from dealing with Moscow, representatives from 12 non-member nations appeared at a Brics Dialogue in Russia this month. They included longtime US foes like Cuba and Venezuela, but also nations such as Turkey, Laos, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Kazakhstan.\nAlso present was Vietnam, which last year upgraded ties with Washington in a move seen as pushback on Beijing's rising influence in the region. Hanoi has been following the grouping\u2019s progress with \u201ckeen interest,\u201d as state broadcaster\nVoice of Vietnam\nput it last month.&nbsp;\n\"Vietnam is always ready to participate in and contribute actively to global and regional multilateral mechanisms,\" Foreign Ministry spokesperson Pham Thu Hang said at the time.\nVietnam welcomed Russia\u2019s leader this week despite strong objections from the US on the grounds that \u201cno country should give Putin a platform to promote his war of aggression\u201d in Ukraine. Vietnam and Russia have ties going back to the Cold War and Soviet era.\nIn their joint statement issued at the conclusion of their talks, Russia welcomed Vietnam's participation in the dialogue earlier this month and said they would \"continue to strengthen ties between the Brics countries and developing countries, including Vietnam.\"\nIt was not clear how much Brics was part of Putin's closed-door talks in Vietnam, though the two nations pledged to boost defence and energy cooperation. China's Li used his trip to Malaysia deepen trade and economic ties and advance construction of major projects.&nbsp;\nUnwieldy group\nAfter this year\u2019s expansion, Brics plans to invite non-member countries to take part in its next summit in the Russian city of Kazan in October. Just hosting the event gives Moscow a chance to showcase to the world that it is not totally isolated by Western opposition to the war in Ukraine.&nbsp;\n\"It's no secret that Washington doesn't love the Brics, particularly with Iran and Russia\u2019s membership,\" said Scot Marciel, a former US ambassador to Indonesia, Myanmar and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean).&nbsp;\nAt the same time, the larger the bloc grows, the less likely it is to find consensus on key issues, he said. \"My sense is, Washington is probably not applauding the move by Thailand and Malaysia to join it, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to cause massive heartburn.\"\nOfficials at the US State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&nbsp;\nThe potential benefits for joining Brics go beyond geopolitics.&nbsp;\nUS$33 billion\nThe bloc\u2019s members have agreed to pool $100 billion of foreign-currency reserves, which they can lend to each other during emergencies. The group also founded the New Development Bank \u2014 a World Bank-modelled institution that has approved almost $33 billion of loans mainly for water, transport and other infrastructure projects since it began operations in 2015.\nThat investment pool would be useful in Southeast Asia, where official development finance dwindled to a low of $26 billion in 2022, according to a report this month by the Sydney-based Lowy Institute.\nAnother draw to membership, Malaysia's Saifuddin said, is the residual negative sentiment toward institutions like the IMF, which pushed austerity measures sometimes blamed in the region for worsening the economic hardship caused by the Asian financial crisis in the late 1990s.\nWashington is not sitting still. It has deepened security links in the region on matters like counter-terrorism, and with countries like Vietnam and the Philippines who are increasingly worried about their disputes with Beijing in the South China Sea. But as the great power competition intensifies across the board, there is also a recognition the region needs to hedge its bets.\n\"There is increasingly less space for smaller countries to manoeuvre,\" Ong Keng Yong, the former secretary general of Asean said in an interview. \"By joining organisations like Brics, countries are signalling that they want to be friendly to all sides, not just to the US and its allies.\"\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat type of building do you prefer for a condominium?\nHigh-rise (more than 10 floors)\nMid-rise (5-10 floors)\nLow-rise (less than 5 floors)\nNo preference\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nRussia\nChina\nBrics\nPutin\nXi jinping\nAsia\nDo you like the content of this article?\n36\n45\nCOMMENT\n(54)",

Somchai Poomlard\nDETROIT OF ASIA\nThe government's push to develop the electric vehicle (EV) industry may help Thailand retain its Detroit of Asia moniker, but uncertainties remain as the country faces a shortage of EV experts and workers. Manufacturers are seeking the most suitable countries for their EV investments, with regional neighbours emerging as major car manufacturing rivals.\n\"Detroit of Asia will be with us because of the state's EV investment promotion,\" said Surapong Paisitpatanapong, vice-chairman of the FTI and spokesman for the federation's Automotive Industry Club.\nEV manufacturing is one of the 12 targeted S-curve industries to be developed within the Eastern Economic Corridor (EEC), covering parts of Chon Buri, Rayong and Chachoengsao. The EEC is projected to become the country's high-tech industrial hub.\nThe 12 industries comprise: new-generation cars (EVs); smart electronics; affluent, medical and wellness tourism; agriculture and biotechnology; food; robotics for industry; logistics and aviation; biofuels and biochemicals; digital; medical services; defence; and education development.\nAuthorities launched EV incentive packages, encouraging car companies to invest in Thailand, with Chinese EV manufacturers commanding a significant share of EV investment.\n\"We welcome investment in battery EVs, plug-in hybrid EVs and hybrid EVs,\" said Mr Surapong.\nThe government set a goal for battery EVs to comprise 30% of total car manufacturing by 2030, including the production of 725,000 zero-emission cars, 675,000 electric motorcycles and 34,000 electric buses and trucks.\nHe acknowledged domestic car sales in Thailand have decelerated as banks impose stricter auto lending criteria amid ballooning household debt, but this was not the main reason that led Suzuki to close its factory in Rayong next year.\nIn a statement released on June 7, the Shizuoka-based car manufacturer said it aims to focus resources on producing electric and hybrid cars elsewhere.\nThe decision is part of Suzuki's plan to adjust its car production strategy worldwide. The company will import vehicles, including EVs and hybrids, from plants in India and Indonesia, for example, said Mr Surapong.\n\"India and Indonesia have larger populations than Thailand. I believe Suzuki also looked for countries with lower production costs than Thailand,\" he said.\n\"We have more expensive electricity bills and wages than those two nations, as well as a smaller market.\"\nWorkers inspect saloons on a production line at a manufacturing plant in Chon Buri province.\u2009Somchai Poomlard\nCHINESE INFLUENCE\nAccording to media reports, Tan Chong Subaru Automotive Thailand, a joint venture between Hong Kong-listed Tan Chong International Ltd and Subaru Corporation, announced on May 29 the closure of its factory in Bangkok's Lat Krabang district by the end of this year amid a market shift towards EVs in Thailand and the company's lacklustre sales performance.\nThis situation is similar to other markets around the world, said an automotive executive from the FTI who requested anonymity.\n\"Every market has seen an influx of Chinese-made cars, especially EVs, as the mainland market can't absorb the total output, prompting Chinese automakers to ship them out, with Beijing providing support,\" said the executive.\nChinese automakers also reported a decline in sales, with BYD the lone exception.\nThe US and EU have imposed measures to curb the entry of car imports, especially EVs from China, said the executive.\n\"But the situation in Thailand is worse than those developed markets as the economy is floundering and political uncertainties are emerging, which both hurt consumer confidence,\" said the FTI executive.\nChinese manufacturers with production facilities in Thailand have a very low ratio of locally produced parts as Thai and even Japanese suppliers cannot compete against Chinese suppliers in terms of cost, said the executive.\n\"We cannot compete because Chinese parts producers have a much bigger production volume through economy of scale. Mainland China has a large availability of natural resources domestically, while Thailand has to import raw materials, even steel, to serve domestic production,\" said the executive.\nTo stay afloat, major manufacturers such as Toyota Motor Thailand are focused on how to improve production efficiency and control costs. Some manufacturing staff have been allocated to serve other functions within the company, said the executive.\n\"Companies with hybrid EV production seem to have competitive advantages for the time being. Those without hybrid cars are in a more serious situation,\" said the executive.\nPrime Minister Srettha Thavisin said earlier the administration would push ahead with plans to grow the EV industry, while also helping businesses linked to the production of ICE-powered vehicles, such as auto parts, as they played a key role in strengthening the country's automotive industry.\nYet the current downturn in car sales and limited resources available to develop the EV industry hamper that ambition.\nThailand recently lost its No.1 ranking for auto exports in Southeast Asia for the first time, said Kriengkrai Thiennukul, chairman of the FTI.\nThis, coupled with sluggish domestic car sales, has raised concerns Malaysia may overtake it as the regional automotive leader, he said.\nThe scarcity of skilled personnel in electric mobility technology may impede the expansion of the country's EV industry, said Mr Kriengkrai.\nThe Electric Vehicle Association of Thailand (EVAT) warned the country faces a critical shortage of EV specialists and skilled workers needed to fuel the growth of EVs and related industries, which last year struggled to fill several thousand professional and employee vacancies.\nMost of the positions required candidates who graduated from a vocational school, while the remainder required applicants possessing a bachelor's, master's or doctorate degree.\nThe EV industry desperately needs experts in the fields of software, material science, simulation and user experience, according to EVAT.\nWorkers at an assembly line process crab meat for export and domestic consumption. Pattarapong Chatpattarasill\nTOUGH JOB\nNonarit Bisonyabut, an economist at the Thailand Development Research Institute, said a large number of Thai workers are still engaged in producing old world goods, instead of meeting the demands of the new world.\nHe said the problem lies in the slow development of Thai workers' skills to support the production of high-tech goods.\nAlthough Thailand can keep up with important global trends, it still lags behind many other countries, resulting in a continuous decline in the country's GDP, said Mr Nonarit.\nIn 2019, prior to the pandemic, Thailand's GDP growth was 2.2%, according to the National Economic and Social Development Council (NESDC). In 2020, GDP contracted by 6.2%, then grew 1.6% in 2021 and 2.5% in 2022. Growth decelerated to 1.9% last year and this year is expected to post 2.5%.\n\"If we want our economy to grow, we must be able to produce goods that meet the needs of everyone in the world,\" he said.\nThailand has positioned itself as a contract manufacturer, or a smart production factory for the world, without having its own brand. This is not necessarily wrong, said Mr Nonarit.\nFor example, Taiwan, a technology exporter, particularly of chips that are at the heart of modern industry, is also a contract manufacturer for various brands.\nSeveral countries such as Malaysia and Vietnam are trying to develop their own brands, including in the automotive sector, but so far have not succeeded, he said.\nMr Nonarit recommended the government urgently strategise and integrate educational institutions to produce personnel with the necessary skills, while working to attract investment in high-tech industries, which would increase the demand for skilled labour.\nCOLLABORATION IS KEY\nSampan Silapanad, president of the Electronic &amp; Computer Employers' Association, said local electronics manufacturers are mostly foreign firms. The two major factors when choosing investment locations in Southeast Asia are cost competitiveness and availability of human resources, with the sustainability of water, electricity supplies and logistics networks minor considerations, he said.\n\"In terms of human resources, companies look at how they can have enough people to run the factories in a sustainable manner and possibly serve potential manufacturing expansion in the future,\" Mr Sampan told the Bangkok Post.\nIn terms of costs, Thailand faces intensifying competition as other countries not only offer investment incentives, but also grants, free land and, more recently, a global minimum tax (GMT), which is an internationally agreed-upon minimum rate of tax paid by large corporations.\nThe GMT allows companies to use tax rebates for activities such as R&amp;D and sustainability, he said.\n\"Rich and clever countries usually draw investments from high-tech industries with those incentives. Thailand has comparatively less financial resources, so we might have to weigh what we can get in return if we offer such incentives to foreign investors. If we cannot compete, we have to switch to second-tier electronics manufacturing instead,\" said Mr Sampan.\nThe semiconductor industry faces a specific challenge. The US is wooing American companies to invest at home rather than overseas to avoid the impact of geopolitics, he said.\n\"Thailand remains competitive in the electronics industry, with up to 500,000 people employed directly. But to further strengthen competitiveness, we have to ensure foreign companies with manufacturing facilities here have transferred their knowledge to locals,\" said Mr Sampan.\n\"Otherwise, Thailand will have nothing much left if they leave after four or five years. Incentives are needed to stimulate knowledge transfer from foreign firms to Thailand through training and education.\n\"Local authorities must have constant conversations with companies to understand what the industry needs and the current obstacles they face, in order to collaborate to try and improve the situation.\"\nRESEARCHERS REQUIRED\nThailand Science Research and Innovation (TSRI) said last week it allocated 8 billion baht for the country to bolster its supply of young researchers, aiming to support S-curve industries such as artificial intelligence (AI), EVs and quantum technologies.\nThe budget for fiscal 2025 also calls for equipping 100,000 employees to support the semiconductor industry, capitalising on opportunities stemming from geopolitical conflict.\nIn fiscal 2025, the government allocated a budget of 19.3 billion baht for R&amp;D, covering 195 agencies and institutions. Of the total, 8 billion baht is for human development, with 2.5 billion of that amount to promote young researchers.\nNirawat Thammajak, vice-president of TSRI, said semiconductors represent a strategic industry in which Thailand needs to attract investment given the geopolitical tension between the US and China causing the relocation of plants away from Taiwan to Thailand, Malaysia and Vietnam.\nMr Nirawat said Thailand has the potential to provide 100,000 highly skilled workers to supply the semiconductor industry.\nThailand has 614,197 people employed in related industries, of which 130,757 are employed in semiconductors and integrated circuits, along with 483,440 in related industries such as computer manufacturing.\nThe Higher Education, Science, Research and Innovation Ministry is expected to propose to the cabinet the development of a workforce plan to fulfil future demand in the semiconductor industry, he said.\nAccording to a Statista Market forecast, the semiconductor market in Thailand is projected to grow by 8.88% from 2024-2027, resulting in a volume of US$13.2 billion in 2027.\nTRANSITION ASSISTANCE\nThe state strategy to cultivate new industries for the digital era should be complemented by support for businesses accustomed to traditional technologies and those that are becoming obsolete, according to the FTI.\n\"The development of S-curve industries is a gradual process, during which old industries must strive to adapt to changes to ensure their survival,\" said Mr Kriengkrai. \"We are most worried about small and medium-sized enterprises prone to the negative impact of economic shifts.\"\nHe urged the government to develop new measures to help these businesses during the shift to modern industry. Without timely solutions, more factories could shutter as the economy plods along, said Mr Kriengkrai.\nThailand's Manufacturing Production Index fell by 5.13% year-on-year in March, declining for 18 consecutive months because of lower car manufacturing as domestic sales plunged, according to the Office of Industrial Economics. During the first quarter this year, capacity utilisation was only 60.4%.\nThe government's decision to impose a 7% value-added tax (VAT)&nbsp;on imported goods could slow the influx of cheap goods into Thailand, but it will not solve the problem, he said. Imported goods sold for less than 1,500 baht per parcel were previously exempt from VAT.\n\"If low-cost Chinese products continue to flood the Thai market, the manufacturing sector will bear the brunt,\" said Mr Kriengkrai.\nMany local entrepreneurs already cut operating costs and use technology to enhance their factory production, but these measures alone are inadequate, as further government assistance is needed, he said.\nSuchit Leesa-nguansuk\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat type of hotel location do you prefer in Thailand?\nBeachfront resorts\nCity-center hotels (close to shopping, restaurants, attractions\nSecluded, nature retreats\nNear airports for convenience\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nSkill\nEconomy\nGap\nDo you like the content of this article?\n33\n8\nCOMMENT\n(28)",

The index peaked at 1,389 points before pulling back below 1,370. Among the key factors expected to influence trading going forward:\nChinese economic recovery: A potential rally in global equities is anticipated due to Chinese economic stimulus measures, including property market support and the establishment of the China Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund (ICF).\nSecond-quarter earnings speculation: Speculative bets on second-quarter earnings are nearing their end. We expect the SET index to see a quarter-on-quarter decline in aggregate net profit to 270 billion baht attributed to longer holidays and potential headwinds from high US interest rates, domestic economic factors and the Middle East situation.\nFed meeting: While investors are still hoping for a Federal Reserve rate cut in September, high US inflation (above the 2% target) and geopolitical tensions create uncertainty. Next week's Fed meeting might offers some clues to the direction.\nThai politics: The government's \"Ignite Thailand\" initiative aims to attract foreign investment and position the country as an agriculture and food hub, among others. However, potential political overhang exists related to court cases against the prime minister as well as former PM Thaksin Shinawatra.\nJUNE OUTLOOK\nThe market's earlier failure to close the gap at 1,394 points could trigger a sharp decline below 1,330, potentially leading to a steeper decline towards 1,320 and 1,308. Conversely, if support at 1,330 holds, the index might experience sideways movement within a range bounded by resistance at 1,380 and 1,400.\nConsider a short-term trading approach to master market volatility. However,  certain stocks remain attractive, particularly those with strong growth potential, robust second-quarter outlooks or exposure to ESG themes and the Chinese economic recovery. Our stock picks for June include:\nBBL (Buy, target 175 baht): Our target for the bank is based on a 2024 price-to-book value (PBV) of 0.6 times, 1.0 standard deviation (SD) below the 10-year average. The stock also has a compelling valuation at 0.5 times PBV (1.25 SD below the 10-year average). Strong risk management, with a sector-leading 292% coverage ratio, provides a buffer.\nCKP (Buy, target 4.50 baht): Our discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis, using a 5.5% weighted average cost of capital (WACC) with no terminal growth value, justifies a buy rating for the power producer. Key catalysts include the receding El Ni\u00f1o effect and the upcoming high season in the third quarter.\nCPALL (Buy, target 84 baht): Our target for the 7-Eleven operator is based on a 2024 price/earnings (PE) ratio of 34 times (0.3 SD below the five-year average). Currently trading at 23 times PE, the stock is undervalued considering the strong growth potential in the second quarter during the high season.\nNER (Buy, target 6.80 baht): Our target for the rubber manufacturer is based on a 2024 PE of 7 times (0.5 SD above the five-year average). Key catalysts include an upcoming overseas investment project, expected to be finalised in the second half of this year, and further development related to its new plant.\nPRM (Buy, target 9.70 baht): Our target for the offshore oilfield services firm is based on a 2024 core PE of 11 times (1.0 SD below the five-year average). A planned capital reduction for repurchased shares through a buyback programme is expected to further boost earnings per share (EPS) by an estimated 7.5%.\nSAPPE (Buy, target 106 baht): Our target price is based on a 2024 PE of 25 times (2.25 SD above the five-year average). Key strengths include a position as a leading global beverage producer, consistent capacity expansion (25-30% annually), and attractive valuation (2024 PE of 24.5 times) relative to impressive EPS growth (41% compound annual growth rate from 2022-24).\nTOP (Buy, target 65 baht): While we project a 22% year-on-year decline in the oil refiner's net profit to 15.2 billion baht in 2024 due to crack spreads returning to normal, overall performance is expected to remain strong. Gross refining margin is still estimated to be high at $7.70 a barrel, and refinery run rates are forecast to stay elevated at 104%. Our target is based on a 2024 PBV of 0.84 times (1.0 SD below the five-year average).\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat type of house are you most interested in?\nSingle-family home\nTownhouse\nSemi-detached house\nVilla\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nStocks\nShares\nInvestment\nDo you like the content of this article?\n0\n1\nCOMMENT",

With such a clear-eyed vision, nobody expected a thunderbolt from the potential member from Southeast Asia announcing the desire to join Brics.\nADVERTISEMENT\nA senior veteran Thai diplomat described the Thai hedging strategy by referencing a hypothetical Hollywood movie with the working title of: \"OECD and Brics: Everything all at once\".\nOfficials at Saranrom Palace probably had a stressful time last week as they had to explain the rationale behind the country's rebarbative move to the Bangkok-based Western diplomatic community who are dumbfounded as to why the country wanted to join Brics at this particular moment, given the bloc's strong \"anti-West\" rhetoric, its stances on the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, the currency war, and the struggle for a new world order.\nRELATED\nopinion\nKorea martial law lessons for Thailand\nopinion\nTrump redux and US-Thai-Asean ties\nHowever, according to government spokesperson Chai Wacharonke, it is Thailand's opportunity to join Brics, which is trying to enlarge its membership base. He added that the current Brics chair, Russia, has invited Thailand to attend the 16th Brics summit in the Russian city of Kazan in October. At the summit, Thailand can accelerate its accession to Brics, enhance its role as a leader among developing countries, and increase its opportunity to shape international economic policymaking.\nThe letter of intent, signed by Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin, stated that Thailand places importance on multilateralism and the increased representation of developing countries in the international system. As such, Thailand, as a Brics member, would benefit the country by elevating its international role and augmenting its leverage to shape a new world order.\nThe decision to join Brics is more than meets the eye. The bid is the decision from the top echelons of the Pheu Thai-led cabinet. It must be noted that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommended that Thailand focus on OECD membership first and then expressed the intention to join Brics later.\nAt the very least, it should be after the OECD Council had decided to consider the Thai bid for accession on June 19 in Paris. So far, Thailand has received positive feedback and support from OECD members, but now the ministry is concerned that Western friends and allies will see Thailand's Brics bid as a reason why it won't end up joining the OECD.\nMeanwhile, Mr Chai is confident that the decision to admit Thailand into Brics could be made by October. The kingdom has good relations with all 10 Brics members, and Thailand and Brics are on the same page when it comes to vision, principles and objectives. Most importantly, both place importance on multilateralism and the increased representation of developing countries in the international system.\nNotably, the current Brics chair, President Vladimir Putin, has maintained a good personal relationship with Thaksin, who was Thai prime minister from 2001-2006. Having Thailand as a Brics member under Mr Putin's watch would be a manifestation of Thaksin's political clout and their good personal ties.\nNext week, Foreign Minister Maris Sangiampongsa is scheduled to attend a special ministerial session on the sidelines of the Brics foreign ministerial meeting in Nizhny Novgorod. He will meet with his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov and deliver the letter of intent to join Brics. This also comes as Pheu Thai chief Paetongtarn Shinawatra prepares to travel to Vladivostok to attend a Brics meeting of the leading government parties in mid-June at Moscow's invitation.\nBrics has been on the Thai diplomatic radar since its inception in 2006. Thai foreign policymakers have often looked for counterbalancing forces, both economic and security, in the international system to maintain the country's strategic equilibrium and autonomy. Closer partnership with Brics is in line with the country's diplomatic objectives of strengthening ties with the developing countries in the Global South, raising international profile, and expanding exports.\nBrics represents 45% of the world's population and 28% of global GDP. It is a huge marketplace for Thailand. Strategically speaking, as a potential Brics member, Thailand could serve as a moderating force as it has good ties with all countries in both East and West. Being the first Asean nation to join Brics, it would be a breakthrough for Southeast Asia, which can also increase the bloc's regional appeal and influence to promote a more balanced geopolitical environment.\nThailand's relations with Brics can be traced back to the summer of 2016 when the leaders of Asean and Russia met in the Black Sea city of Sochi to commemorate 20 years of Russia being an Asean dialogue partner. On the sidelines, former deputy prime minister and foreign affairs minister Don Pramudwinai discussed strengthening ties with Russia bilaterally and under various regional frameworks, including Brics, the Shanghai Organization Cooperation, and the Eurasia Economic Union.\nIn 2022, when China chaired the Brics summit, Thailand was invited to join in a virtual format. Beijing has made it clear that it welcomes Bangkok to join the Brics family. Mr Don attended the latest summit in Johannesburg last August as an observer under the South African chair.\nAt one point, Indonesia was expected to be the first Asean member to join Brics as the bloc decided to enlarge its membership to include five new members -- Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates -- selected from a total of 23 applicants. President Joko Widodo later revealed that Indonesia did not submit the letter of intent as it wanted more time to study the pros and cons of joining the bloc.\nBrics was first comprised of Brazil, China, India, and Russia. It was later joined by South Africa in 2010, which formed the current name. Its main purpose is to promote economic and political cooperation among developing countries. Lately, the bloc has attracted a lot of attention due to its growing economic and political power, which is driven by China and India. Russia has now become an anomaly because of the Ukraine war.\nFor Thailand, the OECD membership is an effort to improve its economic standards and competitiveness. The Pheu Thai government wants to increase foreign direct investment and views the OECD as a vital tool to attract more investors -- it is about economic efficiency and governance.\nHowever, the desire to join Brics carries more strategic significance, given its growing global appeal amid current geopolitical uncertainty. For Pheu Thai, it serves Thailand's interest to be associated with both OECD and Brics.\nNow the ball is in their court -- to accelerate or delay Thailand's dual ambitions. Ultimately, it will depend on the candidate's economic and strategic value-added to these organisations.\nEither way, Thailand will continue to play out its diplomatic balancing act.\nKavi Chongkittavorn\nA veteran journalist on regional affairs\nKavi Chongkittavorn is a veteran journalist on regional affairs\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhich app or platform do you usually use to book accommodations?\nBooking.com\nAgoda\nAirbnb\nTrip.com\nTraveloka\nExpedia\nSkyscanner\nDirectly with the accommodation\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nKavi Chongkittavorn\nGeopolitics\nDo you like the content of this article?\n16\n76\nCOMMENT\n(9)",

The Finance Ministry and the National Economic and Social Development Council both forecast Thailand's economy is unlikely to face a recession this year.\nFollowing a disappointing GDP expansion reading of only 1.5% in the first quarter, trailing other economies in the region, the Thai government plans to pick up the pace to stimulate economic growth.\nAn economic cabinet meeting was called for the first time last week to address urgent issues, with weekly meetings scheduled going forward.\nPrime Minister Srettha Thavisin voiced concerns over a possible recession, if not for the service and tourism sectors.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe private sector holds a range of opinions about recession risks, but some raised concerns that the tourism sector might not be strong enough to buttress the economy in the long run without a proper development direction.\nRECESSION UNLIKELY\nMembers of the Federation of Thai Tourism Associations (Fetta), a grouping of key tourism organisations, believe the tourism industry cannot be the sole support to save the economy from a downturn.\nRELATED\nopinion\nNo more bailouts\nbusiness\nttb Wins Euromoney Award for Thailand Corporate Banking Excellence\nSisdivachr Cheewarattanaporn, president of the Association of Thai Travel Agents and a member of Fetta, said problems on the supply side have not been seriously addressed for decades, which weakens the competitiveness of the country in the long run.\nHe said the state goal of 3.5 trillion baht in tourism revenue this year is a real challenge because not all international markets are healthy and growing. For example, many Chinese have to tighten their travel budget as the mainland's economy stagnates, said Mr Sisdivachr.\nWhile the Thai government targets 8 million Chinese arrivals this year, he said the most likely scenario is 7 million, with expenditure static because of changing travel behaviour.\nHowever, the country may not post a recession this year if other sectors, such as industry and exports, are provided more stimulus measures from the government, said Mr Sisdivachr.\nThe Finance Ministry and the National Economic and Social Development Council (NESDC) both believe the economy is unlikely to face a recession this year. They anticipate accelerated growth for the remaining months of the year.\nA ministry source who requested anonymity said although economic growth in the first quarter was relatively low at 1.5%, there is optimism the pace will accelerate significantly in the remaining months.\n\"It is highly probable the growth rate could surpass 2.4% for 2024 if the rate accelerates in each subsequent quarter, reaching its peak in the fourth quarter,\" the source said.\nPROMISING INDICATORS\nThe source cited the most recent indicators from April, revealing a promising growth trajectory compared with the first quarter. Notably, tourist numbers surged by 4% month-on-month.\nApril also witnessed a resumption in export growth, reaching 6.8%. Although data on industrial production has yet to be released, expectations are optimistic for robust growth in this sector as well, said the source.\nAccording to the source, key risks to monitor include the recovery of China's economy, which is hampered by the real estate sector; geopolitical conflicts between major powers, such as China and the US, as well as war in the Middle East; and government stability.\nThe NESDC, which reported the first-quarter growth figure, forecast annual expansion of 2.5% this year, in a range of 2-3%. This would be an improvement from 1.9% last year.\nThe state planning unit expects a supporting factor this year will be accelerated disbursement of the government investment budget following the implementation of the fiscal 2024 budget at the end of April, after a delay of seven months.\nAccording to the NESDC, other drivers include the ongoing recovery in the tourism sector as foreign tourist arrivals increase; growth in domestic consumption, especially services; and an uptick in private investment, consistent with the increase in capital goods imports, investment promotion in industrial zones, and the gradual recovery of exports as global trade recovers.\nThe unit said economic risks comprise high household and business debt burdens, with rising interest obligations, leading financial institutions to increase caution in lending; the impact of climate change; risks from global economic and trade volatility, which may escalate based on geopolitical conflicts; and changes in the monetary policy direction of major economies, as well as a slowdown in China's growth.\nNO SIGNS\nSanan Angubolkul, chairman of the Thai Chamber of Commerce, said a technical recession requires the economy to contract for two consecutive quarters.\n\"Reviewing the economy over the past six quarters, from the fourth quarter of 2022 to the present, it's evident that while Thailand's GDP has not grown remarkably, it has been positive, hovering around 2% and far from zero,\" he said.\n\"There are no signs of an impending recession.\"\nThe chamber said first-quarter GDP growth was low because of delays in government formation and annual budget disbursement.\nThis led to a contraction in government spending, both in investment and regular expenses, causing a slowdown in the manufacturing and construction sectors.\nThe export sector also declined as the global economic slowdown affected Thai manufacturing, compounded by the agricultural sector suffering from drought, said the chamber.\nHowever, Mr Sanan said the recent economic ministers' meeting is expected to yield new stimulus measures.\nThe chamber anticipates an economic improvement in the latter half of the year, especially in tourism, which is projected to meet the state target of 36 million foreign arrivals, registering robust growth.\nFurthermore, annual budget expenditure for fiscal 2024 is poised to be injected into the economy, along with potential contributions from the digital wallet scheme in the final quarter. These factors should drive expansion in all sectors, he said.\nEconomic variables to watch include domestic politics and geopolitical issues because they will influence whether the Thai economy can achieve its growth targets, said Mr Sanan.\nBIG INDUSTRIAL CHANGES\nThe manufacturing sector requires serious change to increase GDP growth, though the sluggish economy should not fall into recession, said Tanit Sorat, vice-chairman of the Employers' Confederation of Thai Trade and Industry (EconThai).\nAny push in industrial policy should be done in tandem with efforts for more political stability, he said.\n\"We should not solely attribute blame to short-term factors such as delays in budget spending. We must delve into the underlying causes of our sluggish economic growth,\" said Mr Tanit.\nHe said GDP growth has remained low for a decade because of a combination of economic and political factors, including a military coup that slowed some state projects that aimed to strengthen the economy.\nMr Tanit called for plans to improve technologies in the industrial sector, while ensuring there is a sufficient number of workers to serve manufacturers.\nHe said the government has been promoting Industry 4.0 (the fourth Industrial Revolution) for years, encouraging factory operators to blend digital technology with data analytics, but most industries are at the Industry 2.0 level, which focuses on productivity and considerable production capacity.\nThailand has been stuck at this level for some time as manufacturers continue to work in some agro-industries that cannot compete with other countries amid high price fluctuations for crops in the global market, said Mr Tanit.\nA report by the Industry Ministry in 2021 found 61% of domestic industries were at Industry 2.0, with only 2% categorised as Industry 4.0.\nSome 28% were at Industry 3.0, which uses more technology, including automation systems, to replace human labour.\nRoughly 9% were at the Industry 1.0 stage, the lowest level of technological development, which uses some machinery in the production process.\nThailand was once a production hub of hard disk drives, but they have become an \"old technology\" and the country needs to focus on manufacturing printed circuit boards and smart electronics, he said.\nIn the automotive sector, the nation was once dubbed \"the Detroit of Asia\" based on its role as a global production hub for internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles.\nHowever, similar to the shift from hard disk drives, ICE technology is gradually being replaced by electric vehicles (EVs), compelling the industry to transition.\n\"EVs can help stimulate the development of new digital products,\" said Mr Tanit.\nHe also stressed the need to solve the labour scarcity problem, which has prompted Thailand to import several million migrant workers from neighbouring countries.\nVisitors at a pawn shop at the recent Money Expo 2024. High household and business debt burdens, with rising interest obligations, are leading financial institutions to increase caution in lending.\u2009Varuth Hirunyatheb\nGRADUAL RECOVERY\nKKP Research, a research centre  under Kiatnakin Phatra Financial Group, also predicts a gradual improvement in the economy in the latter half of this year.\nHowever, this recovery could be fragile because of various underlying structural issues, said the unit.\nKKP is maintaining its projection for GDP growth in 2024 at 2.6%.\nAccording to KKP Research, Thailand recorded the lowest GDP growth rate in the region during the post-pandemic period, following a contraction of 6.1% in 2020.\nSubsequent growth rates were 1.6%, 2.5% and 1.9% in 2021, 2022 and 2023, respectively.\nSince 2021, Thai GDP growth has consistently lagged behind the potential growth rate, which ranged from 3-3.5% in the period before the pandemic, said the research house.\nThe Thai economy is grappling with fundamental structural challenges, notably in the manufacturing sector, driven by digital disruption and shifting global demand, according to KKP Research.\nExports of value-added products have been declining, while the country's export growth has been partly driven by rerouting rather than organic expansion, said the unit.\nMoreover, the Thai economy has entered into a deleveraging cycle, meaning debt repayment rather than loan growth, noted KKP Research.\nGiven the country's elevated household debt, credit risk in the banking sector has been rising amid weak economic growth.\nAs a consequence, banks have tightened loan approvals, affecting business liquidity and suppressing economic growth.\nThe service sector is a crucial driver of post-pandemic GDP growth in Thailand, said the research unit.\nSince 2021, the service sector posted average growth of 3%, in stark contrast with the 0.5% contraction in the manufacturing sector.\nHowever, the growth of the service sector is mainly fuelled by offshore demand, particularly from foreign travellers, while the manufacturing sector's capacity utilisation remains lower than pre-pandemic levels, according to KKP Research.\nAmid this uneven economic growth, several segments have sagged, leading to a rise in business closures, said the unit.\n\"Since the beginning of 2023, the number of factory closures has increased from 1,100 to 1,700, compared with the same period the previous year,\" said KKP Research.\n\"The closure rate surged in the latter half of last year, correlating with a weaker manufacturing index.\"\nZOMBIE ECONOMY\nAnalysts said increasing political  uncertainties have negatively affected investment conditions over the past week, while there is a lack of positive factors such as short-term stimulus measures.\nSaharat Chudsuwan, deputy managing director of Tisco Asset Management, pointed out the Constitutional Court gave Mr Srettha 15 days to justify Pichit Chuenban's nomination to the court.\n\"The outcome is unclear, but certainly political issues have affected investment, causing investors to wait and see the results,\" he said.\n\"If Mr Srettha is found guilty, the economy may enter a zombie state, but not a recession as the tourism and export sectors are supporting economic growth,\" said Mr Saharat.\n\"But there is a lack of stimulus measures, stopping the economy from growing as it should.\"\nIn addition, there are no positive factors for the Thai stock market, he said.\n\"The political situation is unstable, while the economy and profits of listed companies grew a little,\" said Mr Saharat.\n\"However, if interest rates are cut  and budget disbursement is accelerated in the second half, it will support the Stock Exchange of Thailand index rising in the short term, with a target of 1,450 points.\"\nThe Finance Ministry is preparing to revive tax-deductible long-term equity funds (LTFs), he said.\nIf the government maintains the holding period at five years, LTFs will be attractive to investors, spurring inflows to the stock market during  the economic downturn, said Mr Saharat.\nNuntawun Polkuamdee, Lamonphet Apisitniran and Narumon Kasemsuk\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat is your budget range for renting a condominium?\nUnder 10,000 THB/month\n10,000 - 20,000 THB/month\n20,000 - 40,000 THB/month\n40,000 - 60,000 THB/month\nOver 60,000 THB/month\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nEconomy\nEconomic\nOutlook\nDemand\nStimulus\nDo you like the content of this article?\n10\n88\nCOMMENT\n(24)",

(Photo: Bloomberg)\nSINGAPORE - Thailand\u2019s new finance minister has caught investor attention with a more conciliatory approach to the central bank, opening a window for policy coordination to support the country\u2019s battered markets.\nThailand\u2019s economy, the second-largest in Southeast Asia and heavily dependent on tourism, has struggled as China\u2019s slowdown has held visitor numbers beneath pre-pandemic peaks, while decade-high interest rates throttle domestic spending.\nThe government, which has been pressing repeatedly for urgent rate cuts, has been at loggerheads with monetary policy makers concerned about debt. Meanwhile, an underperforming economy and fractious politics have led foreign investors to sell down the country\u2019s stocks and bonds.\nADVERTISEMENT\nSome $5.5 billion in net outflows from Thai stocks last year has been followed by another $1.9 billion in net selling so far in 2024. The benchmark SET index is down 4% this year and touched three-year lows, making it the worst performer in Asia.\nA calmer tone from Pichai Chunhavajira, a former Bank of Thailand board member who was appointed finance minister last month, is a potential circuit breaker, market participants say, which could give policymakers more room for stimulus and help sentiment.\nRELATED\nbusiness\nModest growth likely for Thai vehicle production in 2025\nbusiness\nCabinet approves debt-relief measures\n\u201cUnder Mr Pichai, the government has been less combative toward the central bank as the administration appears to be leaning on fiscal spending and liquidity injections to support the economy,\u201d said Nicholas Chia, Asia macro strategist at Standard Chartered in Singapore.\nThe cabinet this week approved a plan to\nboost the 2024 fiscal budget\nby 122 billion baht, to help finance the 500-billion-baht digital wallet handout, while Mr Pichai has said the government was planning other short-term measures to revive growth.\nMr Pichai has said he has a duty to work with the central bank and there are no plans to weaken its independence, while public calls from Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin for rate cuts have paused. The central bank\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee will hold its next meeting on June 12.\n\u201cI think he (Pichai) certainly understands the culture of the people at the Bank of Thailand,\u201d former finance minister Thirachai Phuvanatnaranubala told the Reuters Global Markets Forum last week.\n\u201cI think the opportunity for a better relationship going forward is now present.\u201d\nRate worries\nTwo main factors are keeping the Bank of Thailand from cutting.\nOne is global: The US Fed Funds rate is above 5% while Thai rates are at 2.5%. A cut in Thailand would likely add pressure on the baht, which has been sliding this year and is the region\u2019s second-worst performer after the Japanese yen with a 7% drop on the dollar.\nAnother is structural: A 90% household debt-to-GDP ratio is high by regional standards, dampening the pass-through from lower interest rates to higher growth which was already fuzzy in an economy so exposed to world trends in travel and demand.\n\u201cYou can try to entice people to spend now by lowering the cost of money and hopefully they borrow more and then consume or invest,\u201d said Pongtharin Sapayanon, head of Thai fixed income and asset allocation in Bangkok at abrdn, the investment manager formerly known as Aberdeen.\n\u201cBut the big, big assumption here is the capital that is raised from that goes into something productive,\u201d he said.\nMr Pongtharin is underweight on Thailand and expects at best a 25-basis-point cut in the policy rate this year.\nDaniel Tan, portfolio manager at Grasshopper Asset Management, said that although the economy is growing more slowly than others in Asia, a cut may only come in mid-2025 against the backdrop of expected accelerated government spending.\nStill, some conditions are beginning to fall into place and better ties with the government may allow policymakers to act swiftly once the US Federal Reserve begins to cut rates, which would likely come in tandem with investment.\nInflation in Thailand has run well below the central bank\u2019s target for the year \u2014 it was negative for seven consecutive months before rising to 0.2% in April. Last month the Ministry of Finance cut its growth target to 2.4% from 2.8% previously.\nDomestic banks last month cut lending rates by 25 basis points for vulnerable groups for a period of six months, following a plea from the prime minister.\n\u201cWe think these cuts by banks suggest they also see the economy as weak and needs monetary accommodation,\u201d said Charnon Boonnuch, an Asean economist at Nomura.\nRelated\n:\nState bank in asset management joint venture\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat is your budget range for purchasing a house in Thailand?\nUnder 3 million THB\n3 million - 5 million THB\n5 million - 8 million THB\n8 million - 12 million THB\nOver 12 million THB\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nInterest rates\nBank of Thailand\nPichai Chunhavajira\nDo you like the content of this article?\n3\n21\nCOMMENT\n(4)",

Given the unpredictable geopolitical situation, the region will certainly maintain its strategic autonomy in ways that mitigate the ripple effects of the emerging new international order. The multipolar world will be a new ballgame that Southeast Asia has to grapple with. Interestingly, the region's countries also realise that the competition between the US and China is not likely to subside given the tit-for-tat measures they have been conducting with each other. Under such circumstances, what role or leadership can Southeast Asia provide under the Asean roof to ensure that the region will not be marginalised or weaponised? To be precise, how can Asean avoid becoming a pawn in the US-China whirlpool?\nTruth be told, Asean does not have a common strategic plan or playbook to respond to the most consequential US-China tit-for-tats. Since its inception in 1967, the bloc has been able to weather geopolitical pressure. During the the Cold War, the nascent Asean at that time could withstand the geopolitical maelstrom without compromising the bloc's or individual members' interests.\nHowever, in recent years, the geopolitical landscape has completely turned upside down as the US and China have intensified their rivalry and their bilateral relationship has spiralled downwards. Now, Washington and Beijing are wooing friends and allies from around the world to back up their respective strategies.\nADVERTISEMENT\nTo understand Asean's response to the looming rivalry, it is essential to examine the soon-to-be-unveiled Asean Vision 2045. The draft will undergo final vetting by Asean leaders next year under the Malaysian chair.\nRELATED\nbusiness\nMinor seeks to double hotel portfolio\nopinion\nIs Southeast Asia AI's next hub?\nSo far, the draft reflects how 20 members of the committee tasked to draft foresee the geopolitical situation and understand the far-reaching repercussions emanating from the persistent US-China competition. As such, the trajectory of the 2045 vision on the security pillar will be more focused on external relations than ever before. The current Asean vision (2015-2025) emphasises integrating and consolidating the Asean community under the political/security, economic, social/cultural pillars and its well-being.\nFor the next 20 years, Asean must adopt a tangible pathway -- both within the region and at the international level, to fortify its centrality ethos. The launch of its Outlook on Indo-Pacific in 2019 demonstrated that Asean wish and attempt to play a central role in shaping regional architecture. Yet, Asean must be bolder in taking stands on pivotal issues impacting human and global security, not to mention the four priorities under the AOIP guidelines.\nThe bloc will continue to follow its traditional pathway of non-interference, consensus-based decision making and neutrality. Obviously, due to the nature of geopolitical trends in the future, Asean's decision-making process must be speedier in responding to the crisis at hand. In the coming years, Asean's visibility will zero in on issues that are impactful beyond the purview of the US-China conflict, leveraging the bloc's diversity and national interests.\nCurrently, Asean's code of conduct, known as the Asean Treaty of Amity and Cooperation (TAC), could be a useful framework without power politics. The TAC is a peace treaty among Southeast Asian countries established by its 10 members in the 1970s. As the number of signatories has increased annually and has now reached 51 countries -- about a quarter of the UN members -- the TAC should be further promoted. Its main objectives are for peace-loving countries to promote peace and prosperity. Other useful Asean tools include the Southeast Asia Nuclear Weapons Free Zone Treaty as well as the Zone of Peace, Freedom and Neutrality.\nTo be relevant, Asean must put a premium on international rule of law, speaking with one voice on global issues to augment the bloc's international profile and centrality. Its nimbleness and agility must not be found wanting. Asean can display its centrality and global influence during the year-end Asean-related summits. Nearly all the great powers that shape the world's peace and stability descend on the Asean rotational chair's capital. However, with the current growing tension in US-China ties, Asean cannot sit idly by; it must find ways, using the Asean-initiated platforms, for the two superpowers to reconnect and reconcile with one another.\nAt present, Asean has used Asean-led mechanisms such as the Asean Regional Forum, East Asia Summit, and the Asean Defence Ministerial Meeting Plus to express Asean's frameworks and ethos. However, these platforms are still insufficient to make the US and China forge the regional bloc to engage and deepen cooperation to promote peace and stability in Southeast Asia. Asean, which has prided itself on its convening and convincing powers, should now be in a favourable position to initiate US-China dialogue under the auspices of Asean.\nAdditional Asean platforms can help. For example, the so-called Asean Plus Two Forum, which was first brought up at the Asean-China Dialogue in June 2021 by Thailand, could start small without fixing agendas at the working level. As mutual confidence and trust increases, specific topics with senior-level participants could further engage with Asean as a neutral observer.\nAt the end of January, the US National Security Advisor, Jake Sullivan, made a surprise visit to Bangkok and met with Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi to discuss their bilateral issues and cross-border challenges. The meeting helped to highlight the role an Asean member can play in providing a non-hostile venue and promoting understanding between the two superpowers.\nThailand, given its central geographical location and diplomatic profile, has served as a good host. In a broader sense, the Asean region can act as a fulcrum for the two superpowers to engage in new dialogue to reduce tension and increase cooperation. The year-end Asean summits offer unique opportunities for the two powers to do so.\nIn the next 20 years, in more ways than one, the future of Asean stability and prosperity will still depend on the state of US-China relations. The bloc must do everything it can to promote dialogue and cooperation between them. Asean has the platform and the trust of both superpowers. The bloc must get the ball rolling now.\nKavi Chongkittavorn\nA veteran journalist on regional affairs\nKavi Chongkittavorn is a veteran journalist on regional affairs\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat type of accommodation do you usually prefer when traveling in Thailand?\nLuxury hotels (5-star)\nMid-range hotels (3-4 star)\nHostels and guesthouses\nPrivate rentals (Airbnb or villas)\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nSouth east asia\nDo you like the content of this article?\n6\n14\nCOMMENT\n(3)",

        "content": "Opinion\nThe popular decimation of India's democracy\nPranab Bardhan\nPUBLISHED : 18 May 2024 at 04:00\nNEWSPAPER SECTION:\nOped\nWRITER:\nPranab Bardhan\n&nbsp; Small\n&nbsp; Medium\n&nbsp; Large\n3\n4\nPolice stand near a display of Narendra Modi, India's prime minister, during a campaign rally in Mumbai.\u2009(Photo: Bloomberg)\nIndia's ongoing parliamentary election, in which nearly a billion people casting their votes over a six-week period, should represent an extraordinary exercise of democracy. The bleak reality, however, is that the election appears poised to consolidate a decade-long process of democratic decay, which has included the decimation of liberal institutions and practices and weakening of political competition. After all, the leader who has presided over this process -- Prime Minister Narendra Modi of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) -- remains wildly popular.\nApart from the dedicated and disciplined ground-level work by masses of volunteers for Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), the fountainhead of the BJP, this popularity reflects factors sometimes similar to, but also quite different from, those fuelling support for right-wing demagogues elsewhere.\nAs I noted in my 2022 book A World of Insecurity: Democratic Disenchantment in Rich and Poor Countries, such forces tend to find support primarily among less-educated, rural, and older populations. Yet Mr Modi has the backing of educated, urban, aspirational youth. Whereas former US president Donald Trump, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan have struggled to carry major cities in elections, Mr Modi had secured thumping victories in Delhi, Mumbai and Bangalore.\nADVERTISEMENT\nA key reason for this is that political liberalism -- including abiding faith in democratic institutions, checks and balances on government power and free expression -- never really took hold in India, outside of a small Westernised elite. A 2023 Pew Research Center survey showed that 67% of Indians have a positive view of rule by a \"strong leader\" who can make decisions without interference from courts or parliaments -- the highest rate of any of the surveyed countries. Populist demagogues always emphasise the participatory aspects of democracy; but in India, the procedural aspects are particularly weak, enabling vicious forms of majoritarianism and state-abetted persecution of dissenters and, particularly, of religious minorities.\nIlliberalism thrives among India's radical left as well, for whom liberal institutions reek of \"bourgeois\" democracy, and among traditionalists, including Gandhians, as even Mahatma Gandhi, for all his tolerance and empathy, subscribed to the patriarchal and hierarchical values of traditional Indian society. The Hindu-supremacist ideology of the RSS -- which has been influential among the upper castes and classes, particularly in northern India -- certainly does not lend itself to liberalism.\nRELATED\nbusiness\nBBGI predicts higher 2025 revenue\nlife\nChristmas retreats\nPoorer Indians, who have traditionally favoured centre-left national or regional parties, have been attracted to the BJP by the party's strategy of Hindu consolidation, which includes bringing historical leaders (and even deities) of marginal groups under the broad tent of religious nationalism. Social welfare benefits -- often framed as \"gifts\" from Mr Modi (prominently bearing his photograph) -- have helped, as has the BJP's co-optation of sub-caste leaders with promises of official privileges.\nTwo key narratives further bolster support for the BJP, though neither withstands scrutiny. The first is that Mr Modi's government alone can slay the demon of corruption. But there is little evidence that his administration has made progress on this front. On the contrary, according to Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index, India ranked 93rd for corruption last year (out of 180 countries), having fallen eight places since Mr Modi took power in 2014.\nPetty corruption remains rampant in India. Demands for bribes by police officers, inspectors or contractors do not seem to have declined in recent years. Moreover, the disastrous demonetisation that Mr Modi oversaw in 2016 -- which was particularly harmful to small businesses and the poor -- unearthed hardly any of the \"black money\" it was supposed to flush out.\nThere is also little reason to believe that grand corruption has declined. Stories about officials collecting hefty \"commissions\" from contractors on large public projects abound, and government agencies' increasingly aggressive pursuit of \"corrupt\" opposition politicians reeks of disingenuousness.\nIn fact, getting corruption charges dropped or shelved can be as easy as joining the ruling party, even for opposition leaders who have long faced BJP accusations of corruption. These defections contribute to a decline in reported political corruption, but the actual extent of the problem is another story.\nMeanwhile, the BJP -- which exerts near-total control over Indian media -- has ensured that the nexus between politics and business remains opaque. As we know, absolute power can corrupt absolutely. By blocking investigations of questionable business deals involving BJP leaders, the government effectively grants those it favours a kind of \"sovereign guarantee\" of impunity. These are often the same crony firms for which regulatory exemptions and other favours tend to be reserved.\nIt has long been suspected that large sums of money from favoured firms flow into the BJP's coffers. This process was facilitated by \"electoral bonds\" -- an opaque mechanism introduced by the Modi government in 2017, allowing businesses, individuals and organisations to anonymously donate unlimited amounts to political parties -- until the Supreme Court declared them unconstitutional in February. Subsequent disclosures have revealed that these donations were largely from sectors tending to have high levels of extractive rents, owing to dependence on links to the state, with the BJP being by far the largest beneficiary. According to The Economist, Indian billionaires derived nearly half (43%) of their wealth from such sectors in 2021, up from 29% in 2015. Crony capitalism is, after all, a corrupt form of capitalism.\nMaking matters worse, political donations might not always be entirely voluntary, as they sometimes follow raids or charges by investigative agencies. In any case, it is clear that electoral bonds were only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to political dark money in India.\nThe second BJP narrative that resonates most with voters can be summed up as Miga (\"Make India Great Again\"). With the BJP in charge, the propaganda proclaims, India will soon be a global superpower, with all the influence, advantages and prosperity this implies.\nThis narrative -- which the West, seeking an alternative market and geopolitical counterweight to China, has often echoed and reinforced -- has captured the imagination of India's huge number of young people, even those who are unemployed and underemployed. . But it is unlikely to become a reality any time soon: despite some achievements in digital and other infrastructure, and plenty of wealth accumulation by the richest decile of the population, India's economic performance has been middling, at best, over the last decade. By lending credence to BJP hype, Western business leaders, politicians, and media have become complicit in the hollowing out of India's democracy.\n\u00a92024 Project Syndicate\nPranab Bardhan, Professor Emeritus at the University of California, Berkeley, is the author, most recently, of 'A World of Insecurity: Democratic Disenchantment in Rich and Poor Countries (Harvard University Press, 2022)'.\nPranab Bardhan\nProfessor at the University of California\nPranab Bardhan is a professor at the University of California, Berkeley.

This dovish stance injected a sense of optimism into the market, boosting risk assets at the expense of defensive plays.\nRELATED\nlife\nVacheron Constantin unveils limited edition patrimony watch\nthailand\nMondel\u0113z Thailand Drives Growth Through Consumer-Led Innovation\nHowever, the Fed remains committed to strong consumption and employment figures even as inflation remains well above its target. Given all these uncertainties, gold may not settle in a clear direction and could move within a narrow range for a while, said Hua Seng Heng.\nSIGNIFICANT RALLY\nGold prices have soared since the beginning of the year, rising almost 20% to reach an all-time high of $2,431 per ounce in late April, supported by continuous buying from central banks globally. Rising tensions in the Middle East after Iran confirmed it would retaliate against Israel's attack on the Iranian embassy in Syria also supported the rally of the safe-haven asset.\nThe baht also depreciated to weaker than 37 to the US dollar, causing domestic gold prices to post an all-time high of around 42,000 baht per baht-weight.\nGold prices then retreated in late April ahead of the Fed meeting at the end of the month, but remained on course for a third consecutive monthly gain. Spot gold dropped by 1.8% to $2,292.60 an ounce on May 1.\nThe direction of US interest rates remains an important factor for fund movement, gold prices, Thai interest rates, and the recovery of the world economy. If the Bank of Thailand cuts its policy rate ahead of the US, it might stimulate fund outflows, causing the baht to slide further and push gold prices to rise.\nThe Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) held the rate steady in April, but there is a chance the MPC could start to cut the rate next month, which is when some analysts expects the Fed to begin lowering US rates.\nA trader arranges gold ornaments at a shop in Bangkok's Yaowarat area.\u2009Nutthawat Wichieanbut\nCENTRAL ALLURE\nJitti Tangsithpakdi, president of the Gold Traders Association (GTA), said domestic gold prices still have a chance to increase, possibly hitting 44,000 baht this quarter. The main factor is many central banks around the world buying more gold as a reserve to mitigate risks from tensions in the Middle East, resulting in supply tight, he said.\nMr Jitti said he expects the Fed's delayed rate cuts might not have much weight on the price of gold.\n\"The shift from central banks using dollars as a reserve to gold has caused the gold price to rise substantially as demand increases. This trend is likely to continue,\" he said.\nGTA expects the global gold price may increase to $2,500 an ounce this year, but not $3,000.\n\"Anyone thinking of investing in gold during this period still has a chance to make a profit. Even if the price fluctuates in short term, over the long run the price of gold should continue to rise,\" said Mr Jitti.\nAccording to the World Gold Council, central banks around the world have continued to purchase gold. During 2022-2023, they purchased more than 1,000 tonnes of gold per year, and are still buying through this year.\nChina is the top buyer of gold and has been a net buyer for 17 consecutive months, followed by Turkey and India. Thailand also accumulated more gold and has the highest gold reserves in Southeast Asia.\nApart from central banks, gold demand for investment has also risen. Many investors look to gold when the prices of stocks, bonds and property drops drastically. Investing in gold also diversifies a portfolio as varying returns can help protect the value of investments.\nGold prices soared significantly since the beginning of the year, soaring almost 20% to reach an all-time high of $2,431per ounce in late April supported by continuous buying from central banks globally. Apichart Jinakul\nTARGET: $3,000\nAccording to senior commodities strategist Aakash Doshi at Citigroup, gold is set to reach $3,000 an ounce over the next 6-18 months on increasing investor inflows amid expectations the Fed will eventually cut interest rates this year.\nThe Citigroup comments add to a roll call of Wall Street banks that raised forecasts and upgraded their estimates for average prices in 2024 to $2,350, making a \"massive 40% upward revision\" in their 2025 prediction to $2,875.\nTrading will \"regularly test and breach\" $2,500 in the second half of this year, the bank wrote.\nAccording to Citigroup, gold will be driven by increased flows from managed money players, who are already showing signs of catching up with demand from physical consumers in China and central banks.\nThe start of a Fed cutting cycle or a potential recession into 2025 will provide further impetus for investment demand, noted the bank.\nInflows into gold-backed exchange-traded funds (ETFs) largely absent in recent years will \"buffer the path to $3,000\", Citigroup analysts wrote.\nGoldman Sachs joined Citigroup's optimism, noting it raised its gold price forecast to $2,700 per ounce by year-end, up from $2,300 previously as it believes gold is in an \"unshakeable bull market\".\nHowever, Goldman Sachs said there are potential factors that can help to at least restrain gold rate upside, if not generate a bearish reversal. These include a peaceful resolution to conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine and a settling of associated sanctions risk, major emerging central banks concluding their gold-buying programmes, an easing of China growth concerns, and a significant hawkish Fed adjustment leading to hikes.\n\"This would likely present a catalyst for renewed ETF selling. Yet the reality is the near-term potential for a combination of these developments is low, which underpins our expectation for continued bullish momentum in the gold price,\" said the investment bank.\nThailand Gold Research Center said the price of Thai gold and spot gold this year have increased by roughly 20%.\nThe centre said the gold price confidence index in the second quarter increased to 68.5 from 51.7 in the first quarter, a gain of 32.6%, attributed to baht depreciation, inflation, concerns about a global recession, the speculative buying power of funds, and demand for safe assets.\n\"When the price increases for a long period, investors need to be more careful, even though gold still has a chance to increase in the long run,\" stated the centre.\nCustomers browse ornaments at a gold shop on Yaowarat Road. Pornprom Satrabhaya\nFACTORS TO MONITOR\nAnalysts said the main factor that can influence gold prices is supply and demand, such as changes in gold mining production or demand for jewellery, electronics and other industrial uses.\nInvestor sentiment is another factor as economic uncertainty, geopolitical tensions and inflation fears can drive people to seek the safety of gold, increasing demand and driving up prices.\nGold typically has an inverse relationship to interest rates. When rates are low, the opportunity cost for holding gold is lower, so its price tends to rise.\nCurrency movement also affects gold as it is priced in dollars, meaning exchange rate fluctuations can impact its price for investors holding other currencies. Central bank policies can change the market, especially large purchases and selling of gold reserves, influencing supply and demand dynamics, according to analysts. Inflation is vital because gold is often seen as a hedge against it, so expectations or actual increases in inflation can lead to higher gold prices, note analysts.\nAnalysts say supply and demand issues, inflation, interest rates and investor sentiment can all influence gold price movement.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat type of hotel location do you prefer in Thailand?\nBeachfront resorts\nCity-center hotels (close to shopping, restaurants, attractions\nSecluded, nature retreats\nNear airports for convenience\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nGold\nPrice\nInvestment\nTraders\nDo you like the content of this article?\n21\n6\nCOMMENT\n(1)",

US President Joe Biden has just signed a law that will ban the massively popular app in nine months if its Chinese owner, ByteDance, does not sell it to a non-Chinese entity.\nTikTok, for its part, has called the law \"political theatre\", and it is probably right: there is always some theatrics in politics, and bashing China is currently one of the most popular shows in town. But, given the arrogance TikTok exhibited in the weeks and months leading up to the bill's passage, the company's leadership clearly has a fundamental misunderstanding of America and Americans.\nCompared to policymakers in other countries, US lawmakers are usually reluctant to regulate business, and many had previously opposed a forced sale of TikTok for fear that it could create a perception of corruption, reduce business confidence, and undermine free speech. Most agree that when regulation does happen, it should clear the relatively high bar of serving the public interest.\nADVERTISEMENT\nUntil a month ago, the main public-interest concern was data privacy. Questions such as who can access user data, and whether that data can be put to malign uses, are pertinent to all large social-media platforms. Over the past decade, Congress has held many hearings on the issue, often targeting large US companies such as Meta and Google. But these concerns are amplified in TikTok's case, because many US lawmakers assume that the Chinese government can force TikTok to hand over its American users' data. Under laws China enacted in 2017 and 2021, all Chinese organisations are required to assist the government's intelligence-gathering and counterespionage work, if asked.\nRELATED\nopinion\nHumanising the US-China relationship\nopinion\nWhy are so many young Chinese people depressed?\nTikTok promised that it would store Americans' data on servers outside China. That did not satisfy US lawmakers and security officials, who continued to worry about \"backdoors\", an issue that contributed to the US Federal Trade Commission's decision two years ago to ban equipment made by Huawei.\nStill, at one point, there was hope for a workable solution. Since data privacy is an industry-wide concern, TikTok could have played the issue to its advantage, such as by investing in data safeguards and supporting independent research of its own platform. It could have met US lawmakers halfway and approached the issue with the spirit of collaboration.\nInstead, TikTok adopted an aggressive stance, hired expensive lobbyists, and in a catastrophic misstep, even mobilised its American users to call their representatives in Congress. Pop-up messages urged users to, \"Let Congress know what TikTok means to you and tell them to vote NO.\" Some congressional offices received more than 1,000 calls in the space of a day.\nOn the surface, this may have seemed like a savvy strategy, given Uber's earlier success in mobilising its users to lobby against legislation it opposed. But TikTok overlooked a crucial difference: Uber is an American company. By intervening in the US political process, TikTok made the situation much worse for itself, highlighting a second major threat that its critics say it could pose to the public interest.\nOver the past decade, ordinary Americans and lawmakers have grown increasingly concerned about social media's undue influence on users' beliefs, behaviours, and voting decisions, and on how hostile foreign actors can exploit the major platforms for their own purposes. This risk strikes at the heart of American democracy, and it is not just hypothetical. We already know that Russia and other governments regularly try to interfere in US and European elections.\nGiven this context, TikTok's mobilisation of its users wasn't just an annoyance to elected officials' staffers; it was an alarm bell. A foreign-owned company had brazenly demonstrated just how easy it is to manipulate its users to serve its own interests, confirming that it knew all along how much political influence it could exert. Suddenly, and understandably, the focus in the US shifted from Russian voter manipulation to Chinese voter manipulation.\nPerhaps nothing could have saved TikTok from the forced-sale legislation. We will never know what could have been. But it is clear that the company's aggressive strategy backfired. TikTok launched what many saw as an attack on American democracy, and ended up ensuring the majorities that were needed to push the bill through Congress.\nTikTok's future in America is now uncertain. Before it weighs its next moves, the company should fire its lobbyists and consultants, who should have advised it to be more respectful of Americans' legitimate concerns about data privacy and threats to democracy. And all other non-US firms should learn from TikTok's recent missteps on what not to do.\n\u00a92024 Project Syndicate\nNancy Qian, Professor of Economics at Northwestern University, is Co-Director of the university's Global Poverty Research Lab.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nHow much do hotel reviews (e.g., TripAdvisor, Google Reviews) influence your accommodation choice?\nVery important, I always check reviews before booking\nSomewhat important, I check reviews if I\u2019m unsure\nNeutral, I don\u2019t pay much attention to reviews\nNot important at all, I don\u2019t check reviews\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nNancy Qian\nTiktok\nUnited states\nDo you like the content of this article?\n41\n3\nCOMMENT\n(1)",

Sanger of the New York Times\n&nbsp; Small\n&nbsp; Medium\n&nbsp; Large\n1\nGraphic: Wikimedia\nWASHINGTON - US and Chinese diplomats plan to meet later this month to begin what amounts to the first, tentative arms control talks over the use of artificial intelligence.\nA year in the making, the talks in Geneva are an attempt to find some common ground on how AI will be used and in which situations it could be banned \u2014 for example, in the command and control of each country\u2019s nuclear arsenals.\nThe fact that Beijing agreed to the discussion at all was something of a surprise, since it has refused any discussion of limiting the size of nuclear arsenals themselves. But for the Biden administration, the conversation represents the first serious foray into a new realm of diplomacy, which Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke about on Monday in a speech in San Francisco at the RSA Conference, Silicon Valley\u2019s annual convention on both the technology and the politics of securing cyberspace.\nADVERTISEMENT\nAds powered by\n\u201cIt\u2019s true that \u2018move fast and break things\u2019 is literally the exact opposite of what we try to do at the State Department,\u201d Blinken told the thousands of cyberexperts, coders and entrepreneurs, a reference to the Silicon Valley mantra about technological disruption. But it is that disruption,&nbsp; from a quickening pace of sophisticated cyberattacks, to the vulnerability of undersea cables, to the battle for control of the internet and the influence operations it enables that has driven agencies across the government to design strategies for dealing with emerging technology threats.\nRELATED\nopinion\nTrump's return presents an opportunity for India\nbusiness\nThai manufacturers brace for impact of Trump tariffs\nThe Biden White House issued a national strategy for dealing with cyberspace. The Pentagon has written one focused on deterring attacks. The Department of Homeland Security homed in on resilience. But the last formal State Department strategy for diplomatic engagement on the topic was written a dozen years ago, in President Barack Obama\u2019s first term. Ransomware was not yet a scourge, and the technology behind Chat GPT was still years away. While cyberattacks were well underway, including some launched by US intelligence agencies, they had not become a daily staple of geopolitical competition.\nBut the new strategy comes at a time when the early optimism about a \u201cglobal internet\u201d connecting the world has been shattered. What is left is what Nathaniel Fick, the State Department\u2019s first ambassador for cyberspace and digital policy, who is expected to play a key role in the discussions with China, refers to as a \u201cfragmented system\u201d that is unlikely to ever be sewn back together.\n\u201cJust about everyone is willing to acknowledge that technology is an important element of foreign policy, but I would argue that tech is not just part of the game, it\u2019s increasingly the entire game,\u201d Fick said in an interview. \u201cThink about it \u2014 asymmetric advantage in the war in Ukraine, global competition with China on key technologies, the ability of Israel and its allies to intercept Iranian aerial attacks. All tech,\u201d he said. \u201cThe international order will be defined by whose metaphorical operating system dominates.\u201d\nFick\u2019s strategy, written with Adam Segal, a Council on Foreign Relations expert on cyberspace whom Fick brought into the State Department\u2019s new cyber and digital bureau to help write the strategy, focuses on the concept of \u201cdigital solidarity\u201d with allies and partner states that have a common view of the rules that should govern technology and information flows.\n\u201cWe have to hang together with allies and partners, truly investing in digital solidarity, or we\u2019ll get picked apart by those who have a very different view of tech\u2019s role in the world,\u201d Fick said, a clear reference to the growing partnership of Russia and China.\nAs a result, the strategy goes beyond the rules of managing cyberconflict and focuses on US efforts to assure control over physical technologies such as undersea cables, which connect countries, companies and individual users to cloud services.\nHuawei, the Chinese telecommunications giant, has been seeking to dominate the laying of cables across the Pacific and, increasingly, around the world. But Fick maintains that US, Japanese and European firms still dominate the market, and that \u201cthis remains one area where we can compete vigorously.\u201d\nBlinken, in his speech, made clear that part of the diplomacy he envisions involves persuading nations not to rely on undersea cables, data storage or cloud computing supplies from Chinese suppliers, or other states in China\u2019s technological orbit. He describes an increasingly zero-sum competition, in which countries will be forced to choose between signing up for a Western-dominated \u201cstack\u201d of technologies or a Chinese-dominated one.\n\u201cIn these arenas, the United States currently leads the world, but providers from authoritarian states are increasingly competitive,\u201d Blinken told the RSA Conference. \u201cIt\u2019s critical we work with trusted vendors and exclude untrustworthy ones from the ecosystem.\u201d Blinken made clear, by implication, that it was China\u2019s firms he was labeling as untrustworthy. He cited a US-backed effort, along with Australia, Japan, New Zealand and Taiwan, to link up 100,000 people living in the Pacific islands \u2014 a tiny population, but one that China has targeted because of its strategic location \u2014 in its effort to expand its influence in the South Pacific. \u201c\nAny disruption, or compromise, could isolate a country, threaten national security or lead to billions of dollars in damage,\u201d Blinken said.\nThe new State Department strategy acknowledges that cyberweaponry and a range of digital tools were central to Russia\u2019s effort to take over Ukraine in 2022 \u2014 starting with the attacks on the Viasat satellite system that kept the country\u2019s government agencies connected. And it notes that Ukraine was kept connected because of technology provided by Microsoft, Amazon World Services and Elon Musk\u2019s Starlink, which enabled embattled authorities in Kyiv to move their records and communications to the cloud, just days or weeks before Russian attacks that destroyed computer servers around major cities.\nBut the new strategy says surprisingly little about how to deter state-directed attacks, a focus of the Obama-era strategy and a source of continuing frustration for US officials. It also acknowledges the degree to which China has penetrated US utility and water supply networks, installing malware that US intelligence agencies have assessed are designed to trigger chaos and slow a US military response if Beijing decided to invade or choke off Taiwan.\nThe strategy describes that operation, which Microsoft\u2019s investigators have named \u201cVolt Typhoon,\u201d in unusually stark terms. It characterizes China as capable of \u201claunching cyberattacks that could disrupt oil and gas pipelines, rail systems and other critical infrastructure services within the United States or its allies and partners.\u201d&nbsp;\nthe State Department report, using the initials for the People\u2019s Republic of China, continued, \u201cAttempts to compromise critical infrastructure by PRC actors are designed in part to preposition themselves to be able to disrupt or destroy critical infrastructure in the event of a conflict,\u201d&nbsp; \u201cto either prevent the United States from being able to project power into Asia, or to affect our decision-making during a crisis by instigating societal chaos inside the United States.\u201d\nThis article originally appeared in\nThe New York Times\n.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat is your budget range for purchasing a condominium?\nEkkamai-Thong Lor\nSathorn-Silom\nChidlom-Siam\nBang Na\nChinatown\nAri\nRiverside\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nDo you like the content of this article?\n2\n0\nCOMMENT\n(1)",

From April 17-19, the Thai index fell 4.6% or 64.3 points, with market capitalisation decreasing 813 billion baht to 16.9 trillion from 17.7 trillion before the start of the long Songkran holiday on April 11.\nThe SET rebounded by 1.3% on April 22, similar to other stock exchanges as concern over Middle East conflicts subsided.\nAsia Plus Securities (ASPS) said the conflicts pressured high-risk assets including stocks, following the attacks by Israel and Iran.\nThe brokerage estimates the economic impact of the war at 1% of GDP this year, pushing global inflation to 1.2%.\nASPS said the conflicts have pressured the SET index in a series. When Israel started its invasion of Gaza in October 2023, the Thai index fell 81 points. Cases of shipping piracy in the Red Sea in January this year coincided with the SET losing 61 points.\nWhen Iran attacked Israel during Songkran, the index fell 78 points to near 1,330 points.\n\"The index declined 60-80 points when the situation was violent,\" said the brokerage.\n\"The ongoing conflicts in the Middle East, like other recent wars, have a psychological impact on stock markets, but the damage is unlikely to be severe unless the US takes part in the fighting,\" said Bamrungpong Chevatanakornkul, senior vice-president for investment at ASPS.\nAs geopolitical conflicts escalated, oil prices rose, pressuring the SET index to dip in the short term. However, the decline should be minor as oil stocks account for one-third of SET capitalisation, he said.\nAnother consequence of higher oil prices is more persistent inflation, according to many analysts. As a result, the Fed may delay cutting interest rates until late 2024, limiting any SET index rebound, said Mr Bamrungpong.\nASPS's strategist team believes the chances of oil prices rising significantly would only happen as a result of supply chain issues. For example, if Iran allies with Syria, Iraq, Yemen and Bahrain to boycott oil exports to western countries, or if Iraq blocks the Strait of Hormuz, which supports 20% of the world's marine oil shipments, said the brokerage.\n\"Absent such incidents, we see limited impacts from the ongoing conflicts on oil prices,\" said ASPS.\nIran exports 700,000 barrels of oil per day, representing 0.7% of oil consumption globally, and produces 3 million barrels a day or 3% of global consumption, said the brokerage.\nOIL SUPPLY WATCH\nNational oil and gas conglomerate PTT Plc, a key petroleum supplier in the country, said Thailand has sufficient oil to meet demand amid concerns over the impact of the Israel-Iran conflict on global supply.\n\"It's difficult to predict whether the tension between the two countries will escalate, but as a state-owned company, we ensure oil and gas will not be scarce in Thailand,\" said Auttapol Rerkpiboon, president and chief executive of PTT.\nOil and gas must be sold at fair prices in the country, meaning PTT does not face losses and oil buyers are not affected, he said.\nDuring the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, which drove up global crude oil prices, PTT decided to buy an additional 4 million barrels, enough to last roughly five days in case of a possible shortage.\nThere were inadequate storage facilities on land, so the company kept the oil on ships.\n\"The decision allowed the country to avoid oil scarcity,\" said Mr Auttapol.\nHe said the company should have no problems acquiring oil. Its oil drilling arm PTT Exploration and Production Plc runs a petroleum business in many regions outside the Middle East.\nThailand needs to use oil from various sources as part of a risk diversification plan, said Mr Auttapol.\nLast year PTT acquired up to 1.5 million barrels of oil per day, while national demand tallied 900,000 barrels per day.\nPTT has yet to implement an emergency acquisition plan for oil and gas following volleys by Iran and Israel, but the company has prepared measures to ensure sufficient oil for use in the country, he said.\n\"We are monitoring the situation and have petroleum trade plans in place,\" said Mr Auttapol.\n\"We also check oil storage and transport facilities to ensure they are ready to serve our business.\"\nCURRENCY DEPRECIATION\nAccording to the latest edited minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting, the Bank of Thailand recognises the baht's volatility against the US dollar and its greater depreciation compared with regional peers.\nThis trend is primarily driven by external factors, such as the monetary policy outlook of the Fed, along with domestic economic and financial developments such as a weaker economic performance than projected and fluctuations in gold prices, according to the minutes.\nThis year the baht has registered its lowest level relative to other regional currencies. After the MPC maintained the policy rate at its recent meeting, the baht's volatility against the greenback diminished.\nPiti Disyatat, assistant governor for the monetary policy group at the central bank, also highlighted seasonal factors, particularly tourism and dividend payments from SET-listed companies, as significant drivers pressuring the baht's depreciation.\nForecasts suggest a slight decline in foreign arrivals in the second quarter because of seasonal factors and Thailand's hot climate.\nIn addition, SET-listed companies are anticipated to transfer dividends totalling around 2 billion baht to their parent firms overseas in the second quarter of this year.\nHowever, expectations for Thai economic expansion in the latter half of the year are driven by budget disbursements for fiscal 2024, improvements in tourism and a rebound in exports, bolstering the baht's performance against the dollar, according to Mr Piti.\n\"The Bank of Thailand will keep a vigilant eye on baht fluctuations. At the moment, body deems it unnecessary to introduce further policies to manage the local currency,\" he said in the minutes.\n\"Maintaining the policy rate at its current level will contribute to baht stability relative to the US dollar.\"\nHowever, the central bank intervened on Wednesday to steady the baht as it teetered around 37 to the dollar.\nAccording to ASPS, despite persistent outflows, the baht is unlikely to weaken beyond 37 per dollar, and it may strengthen soon if fund inflows return.\nThe brokerage noted the Fed is expected to maintain elevated interest rates for an extended period, while concerns about conflicts in the Middle East have diminished.\nAs of February 2024, Thailand's foreign exchange reserves amounted to 8.4 months of imports, accompanied by a current account surplus of $2 billion.\nThailand's economic revival is evident from both government and private investment, as well as government spending, according to ASPS. Consumer spending should be fuelled by the adoption of the digital wallet scheme, said the brokerage.\nEconomic institutions project Thai GDP growth of 2.8% this year, up from the 1.9% posted in 2023.\nThe baht has depreciated by 7.8% this year as of April 23, while the US dollar has strengthened by 4.7%.\nEXPORT SECTOR UNFAZED\nChaichan Chareonsuk, chairman of the Thai National Shippers' Council, said exports could experience a slight impact from Mideast skirmishes because there is minimal trade value between Thailand and Iran.\nIsrael is responsible for less than 0.1% of Thai exports, according to the council.\nThai exports to the Middle East include farm products, processed agricultural goods, car parts, electrical appliances and rubber.\nHowever, if the tension escalates and expands to include other countries in the region, Thai exports will be severely affected as the Middle East is a key trading partner, accounting for 4% of Thai shipments, said Mr Chaichan.\nThai exports to the Middle East grew 23% in 2022 and 24.6% last year.\nCountries in the Middle East, which possess 48.3% of the world's oil reserves, play a vital role in global oil production and export.\nIf the conflict broadens to include the closure of the Strait of Hormuz -- the world's busiest oil-shipping channel -- it would cause a surge in crude oil prices and affect global trade, he said.\nMoreover, the closure of the Bab el-Mandeb Strait in response to threats against the US, a key route crossing the Red Sea, could affect Thailand's trade with the Middle East and Europe.\nEven though the tension in the Middle East eased and shipping activity returned to normal, traders are monitoring the situation as Thai exports to Europe accounts for 8% of total shipments, said Mr Chaichan.\n\"Given no further escalation of the conflict in the Middle East, Thai exports are expected to grow 1-2% in the first quarter and first half this year,\" he said.\nThe baht's depreciation to 37 to the dollar is a boon for the export sector, said Mr Chaichan.\nKey export products with continued demand include automobiles and auto parts, vehicle tyres, electronic components, air conditioners and food products, according to the council.\nHowever, Thai exporters should be prepared to deal with geopolitical uncertainties by tapping new markets, particularly in Southeast Asia, China and India, if the conflict expands to other parts of the Middle East, he said.\nBusiness operators should also consider reducing production costs as prices of crude oil may surge up to $90 as barrel.\nProduction planning should maintain a delicate balance between supply and demand amid increasing downside risks, such as a global economic slowdown and ongoing geopolitical tensions, said Mr Chaichan.\nLIMITED EFFECT\nSiripakorn Cheawsamoot, deputy governor for Europe, Africa, the Middle East and the Americas at the Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT), said El Al Israel Airlines still maintains 1-3 daily flights as usual from Tel Aviv to Bangkok and Phuket. These flights are still posting overwhelming demand, said Mr Siripakorn.\nHe said the only flight cancellations occurred on April 13-14 as airspace in conflict areas were restricted at that time.\nMahan Air, which operates full-service flights from Tehran, also maintained its flight schedule to Thailand as passenger demand remains steady despite the conflict.\nA TAT market forecast for the second quarter said geopolitical concerns would have indirect impact on tourism demand to some extent as higher fuel costs affect airfare and might discourage long-haul visitors from travelling to Thailand, particularly family groups.\nSome potential travellers might be concerned about escalating wars and instead save their resources for more daily necessities, noted the forecast.\nJET FUEL\nAccording to energy information provider Platts, the weekly global average jet fuel price ending on April 19 fell by 3.7% compared with the week before to $106.89 per barrel, after soaring to $111.3 in the first week of April.\nWutthiphum Jurangkool, chief executive of Nok Air, said while jet fuel prices didn't surge because of ongoing conflicts in the Middle East, most airlines were affected by the weak baht as the majority of airline expenses must be paid in US dollars.\nHe said the average price of Jet-A1 fuel for commercial planes last week was $105.7, which is high for passengers if translated into airfare and fuel costs, which make up 30-40% of total expenses.\nMr Wutthiphum said one indirect impact would be airlines awaiting maintenance services at maintenance, repair and operations (MRO) centres.\nIf there are airspace closures in the future, some airlines might have to switch to other MROs in different countries, some of which are already crowded as every airline is competing to bring back their aircraft post-pandemic, he said.\nNarumon Kasemsuk and Phusadee Arunmas\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhich app or platform do you usually use to book accommodations?\nBooking.com\nAgoda\nAirbnb\nTrip.com\nTraveloka\nExpedia\nSkyscanner\nDirectly with the accommodation\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nDo you like the content of this article?\n4\n13\nCOMMENT\n(8)",

Cambodia is one such case.\nLast July, after nearly 40 years in power, then-prime minister Hun Sen announced that he would transfer power to his eldest son, Hun Manet. The hereditary succession was preceded by national elections that Hun Sen's ruling Cambodian People's Party (CPP) claimed to have won by a landslide; but the United States declared the vote as \"neither free nor fair\", while European Union officials said it was \"conducted in a restricted political and civic space\". Since then, however, the international community has more or less accepted Cambodia's dynastic autocracy.\nLike his father before him, Hun Manet has sought to assert control over Cambodians by interfering in their daily lives. In March, for example, the new prime minister banned musical vehicle horns, which, as videos on social media have shown, encourage people to dance on the streets. Authorities fear that such public displays of joy could cause civil unrest.\nADVERTISEMENT\nCambodians have suffered under iron-fisted rule for decades, a trajectory that began with Hun Sen's ascent to power in 1985. After serving as a middle-ranking officer in the Khmer Rouge, he defected to Vietnam, which installed a new government after invading Cambodia in 1979. First as foreign minister and then as prime minister, Hun Sen worked to strengthen his grip on a country exhausted by war and decimated by the Khmer Rouge's genocidal rule, which murdered up to 2 million people (including my parents).\nWhen the first democratic elections were held in May 1993, under the watch of the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia, Hun Sen refused to cede power, even though the CPP finished second, and became one of two prime ministers under a power-sharing agreement. In a violent coup in 1997, Hun Sen deposed his co-prime minister and eliminated others who posed a threat to his rule. He went on to reintegrate hundreds of Khmer Rouge soldiers into Cambodian society, with many swapping their guerrilla garb for military uniforms as part of his \"win-win\" strategy.\nRELATED\nworld\nCambodia breaks up protest over alleged China military base\nthailand\nHunt on for Rainsy supporters\nUnder the pretext of maintaining stability, Hun Sen's government jailed opposition activists, journalists and trade unionists while aligning with China to extend its hold on power. Last year, Chinese President Xi Jinping personally congratulated Hun Sen on \"winning\" the rigged elections. Moreover, Cambodia's constitutional monarch, Norodom Sihamoni, refused to defy Hun Sen. The king often strategically absents himself from the country to avoid signing controversial legislation, allowing the president of the Senate to sign on his behalf.\nThe family dynasty and its supporters left nothing to chance ahead of Hun Manet's accession in August 2023. In addition to selecting Hun family loyalists as parliamentary candidates, the regime barred the opposition Candlelight Party from contesting last year's elections and viciously attacked its members. The government thus continued its systematic repression of the political opposition: those who stay in the country are routinely jailed, often on trumped-up technicalities and accusations of fraud, while those living abroad have been sentenced in absentia to decades of imprisonment.\nSince taking office, Hun Manet has strengthened the stranglehold on independent media that his father initiated by surveilling journalists and threatening to close outlets that criticise the regime. Most worryingly, he has continued to court China, meeting with Mr Xi in September. This suggests that his government, with the support of a powerful ally, will clamp down harder on democratic rights. The deployment of mass surveillance in major cities, including Phnom Penh, and internet shutdowns further underscore Hun Manet's determination to maintain control.\nThe large influx of Chinese money and manpower into Cambodia also threatens to stoke tensions with Vietnam. Hun Manet's government dances to all tunes. He congratulated Russian President Vladimir Putin on his \"landslide\" re-election, and he has finalised plans for the controversial, Chinese-financed Funan Techo canal, which would allow Cambodia to bypass Vietnam for its international trade and thus reduce its reliance on its neighbour. The project, together with the recent Chinese-funded upgrade of Cambodia's Ream Naval Base, highlights China's growing military and economic influence.\nMeanwhile, Hun Manet has attempted to curry favour with the international community. In a speech at the most recent UN General Assembly, he claimed that Cambodia's \"democratic building process has steadily advanced\". So far, the West has given Hun Manet the benefit of the doubt. But US and European policymakers must wake up. For all their talk of countering a rising China, their passive acceptance of the Cambodian prime minister has given his government carte blanche to bulldoze what remains of the country's fledgling democracy while allowing China to expand its reach in Southeast Asia.\nThe US government, in particular, has numerous tools -- including the Cambodia Democracy Act, the Global Magnitsky Act and, if it passes, the proposed Transnational Repression Policy Act -- that it could use to apply pressure on Hun Manet's regime and hold it accountable for its abuses. These targeted sanctions should be coordinated with countries with similar legislation. American officials can and should bring the Hun family dynasty to heel by imposing sanctions on those who are undermining democracy and engaging in corruption.

The West is seeking to reduce concentration (with China), she said in an interview with the Bangkok Post in Bangkok.\nRELATED\nbusiness\nThailand's Eastern Economic Corridor to include Prachin Buri\nbusiness\nPM backs new free trade area\n\u201cAgainst that backdrop, Asean's cumulative import-export trade is forecast to grow $1.2 trillion in the next ten years due to the region\u2019s emergence as a key destination for companies seeking to decrease their dependence on China for manufacturing by adopting a \u2018China + 1\u2019 diversification strategy,\u201d Marc Gilbert, managing director and senior partner of BCG, noted.\n\u201cAsean is an attractive China alternative because of its young and dynamic population, economic diversity, and generally neutral stance among geopolitical blocs,\u201d he added.\n\u201cFurthermore, China's cost position has increased over time while Southeast Asia's position in that regard has becoming more favourable, making it (Asean) an attractive place to shift manufacturing to.\"\nMr Gilbert said BCG believes Thailand's total trade will grow by an estimated 30% over the next decade to reach approximately $600 billion.\nThailand also has potential to become a regional hub for highly-skilled workers, especially given its positive track record over the past 12 months in attracting talent from India, China and Myanmar.\nMeanwhile, at current trajectory, BCG projects Asean's digital economy could reach $2 trillion by 2030.&nbsp;\nIn fact, the \u2018Age of Asia\u2019 is in many ways the age of ASEAN, with the region\u2019s strong economic growth, robust youth population, and its emergence as a key destination for global companies, BCG said\nFall-off in US-China trade\nPersistent trade tensions and growing trade barriers are continuing to impact trade between China and the West.\nThe projected fall-off in US-China trade is one of the most significant developments in the updated global trade map, with 2032 trade value forecast to fall $197 billion from its 2022 level.&nbsp;\nThis is more than three times the $63 billion contraction forecast one year ago in a similar BCG analysis.\nThe change is due to China\u2019s slowing GDP growth in 2022, combined with other factors. China\u2019s trade with the EU will continue to grow, but more slowly than the global average.\nSlower global trade\nWorld trade in goods is forecast to grow at 2.8% per year, on average, through 2032, compared with an estimated 3.1% growth rate for global GDP in the same period, according to a new BCG analysis.&nbsp;&nbsp;\nIndia Ignition\nSimilar to Asean, India is benefitting from a low-cost structure and capable workforce to rise as a major domestic market and \u201cChina + 1\u201d destination for global manufacturing.\nIndia\u2019s large market and particular strengths in industries such as chemicals, consumer electronics, and pharmaceuticals are attractive for companies seeking to diversify their global footprint.\nExpanding trade connectivity, as evidenced by new and under-negotiation trade agreements, are helping to increase India\u2019s projected external trade in the next ten years by $393 billion, including $180 billion with the US and EU and $124 billion with China.\nChina moves goods elsewhere\nAs the world\u2019s leading exporter of manufactured goods, China itself is resilient.&nbsp;\nBCG said trade that stops flowing between China and the West will simply move elsewhere.\nNotable beneficiaries of reduced US concentration in China will be the Asean countries and India as many companies move manufacturing to these economies, both to reduce global supply chain risks and to access new markets.\nAs a result, trade between Asean and China would grow a remarkable $616 billion in the coming decade\u2014and trade between Asean and both the US and Japan will increase by more than $200 billion.\nIndia is forecast to achieve 6.3% average annual trade growth, partly because of this rebalancing of China trade.\nStronghold North America\nThe United States, Canada, and Mexico will benefit from the US Mexico Canada Agreement (USMCA), as US trade with its neighbours is forecasting to grow by $466 billion in the coming decade.&nbsp;\nFaced with a combination of economic pressure and national security concerns, the Biden administration has adopted a new focus on industrial policies with a more protectionist bent, such as the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) and the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).\nThe result is a more influential regional manufacturing footprint with direct investment into strategic industries.\nRussia Trade Divergence\nThe break in Russia\u2019s trade with the EU and the US caused by the war in Ukraine and the resulting sanctions and reduced European dependence on Russian energy will influence Russia\u2019s trading profile at least as long as the stalemate in Ukraine continues.\nThese conditions have not led to the elimination of Russian trade, but rather its redirection elsewhere. For example, much of the trade with the EU has shifted to Russia\u2019s fellow BRICs countries: Brazil, China, India, and South Africa.\nWhile Russia\u2019s trade with the EU in 2032 will fall by $222 billion, compared with 2022, its trade with China and India will grow by $134 billion and $26 billion, respectively.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nHow important are environmental sustainability practices (e.g., eco-friendly rooms, waste reduction) when choosing accommodation in Thailand?

Amidst intensifying geopolitics, Asean is in a position where this could either be a blessing or a curse.\nThese three factors will determine the 57-year-old bloc's diplomacy. It still has the ability to help mitigate -- or exacerbate -- tensions between the trio.\nFirst of all, side-taking is not a favourable strategy. Any member of Asean perceived as tilting towards one direction could rock the Asean modus operandi.\nADVERTISEMENT\nWhile each country in Southeast Asia has its own diplomacy, this should not undermine Asean's main stance.\nFor the immediate future, three scenarios can be discerned for Asean.\nRELATED\nopinion\nLike bamboo swaying in the wind\nbusiness\nFinnomena touts US, India and Vietnam for investment\nThe most ideal situation is balanced ties among the three powers -- the US, China, and Japan. Fortunately, two are located in Asia. When Beijing and Tokyo work together, their efforts can ease anxiety and tension among the broader international community, both East and West.\nBut when this balance is disrupted, all possible scenarios can rear their ugly heads.\nSo far, Asean has been able to navigate delicate relations by using Asean-led mechanisms, ie dialogue and cooperative frameworks.\nSince 2005, the leaders of the three powers have met at the East Asia Summit (EAS), which Asean has chaired. This platform has been a space for leaders to exchange views.\nHowever, the other non-Asean EAS members are shaping the agenda through the Asean envoys based in Jakarta. This will impact the EAS discussion on regional issues.\nIt must be said that Washington, regardless of its declining influence in the Southeast Asian region, has now framed the EAS as a broader strategic Indo-Pacific area and is using it to counter China and its growing influence.\nThat may explain why Japan, as the most trusted regional partner of Asean, has now come to the fore. Since 2017, Japan has been constantly beefing up strategic relations with Asean, especially the Philippines and Vietnam, who share some menacing strategic challenges concerning Beijing.\nTo prove that Tokyo is serious, its new Official Security Assistance Program has already two recipients from Asean, the Philippines and Malaysia.\nFor Washington, burden-sharing and using allies as bridges to execute broad strategies are not new. Under the late Abe and current Kishida administrations, Japan has linked the US with key Asean members in both economic and strategic matters.\nA glaring example is Japan's role in reviving the defunct Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade agreement that former US President Donald Trump withdrew America from in 2017.&nbsp;To maintain TPP's gist, Japan launched an alternative called the Comprehensive and Progressive Tran Pacific Partnership (CPTPP ).\nAnother example is the Indo-Pacific&nbsp;Economic Framework, which was launched in Tokyo two years ago. It was based on Japan's recommendations to reach out to larger Asean economies after the US pulled out of the TPP. In response, Asean strongly supported Japan's Free and Open Indo-Pacific framework.\nJapan has been able to take this role mainly due to the high level of trust among the Asean members. According to the latest survey on the State of Southeast Asia by the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute, Japan has remained the most trusted partner of Asean since the survey was initiated 15 years ago.\nToday, Japan continues to have consistent and close consultations with Asean as equal partners. Last December, Japan and Asean adopted a strategic plan and joint vision -- testaments that marked the 50th anniversary of Japan-Asean ties.\nAs long as Japan continues to deepen cooperation and ties with Asean, its relations with China have the potential to improve. This is partly due to the nature of Asean's engagement with the 'Plus Three' countries, which include China and South Korea.\nOne caveat is in place: Japan has to maintain its longstanding independent policy when it engages with Asean. The bloc does not want to see Japan acting on behalf of the US.\nAsean fully supports Japan's vision and action plans, including its Free and Open Indo-Pacific (FOIP), as they are not construed as being born of US strategies to contain China.\nBut the trilateral summit this week hosted by US President Joe Biden, which will include the leaders of two Asian allies -- Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Junior -- could be a new red line for Asean-Japan relations. A mini-multilateral arrangement with a strong US-Japan strategic thrust, including an Asean member, could polarise the bloc.\nThe ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute survey also showed the rise of China's influence in the region. The study, which was released last week, showed 50.5% of Asean members' willingness to align with China if it had to choose sides, against 38.9% last year. For the US, the percentage is 49.5%, down from 61.1% a year earlier.\nNevertheless, the level of mistrust in China stood at 50.1%, owing to concerns that China could use its economic and political powers to threaten their countries' sovereignty and interests. Granted China's dominant economic and security role in the region, the love/fear dichotomy would be an important issue for Beijing to contemplate and manage.\nTo improve the current situation, better communications and messaging of China's actions and policies in the age of digitalisation and social media's echo chambers are necessary.\nJapan, China and South Korea are now working together to hold the next trilateral summit in May, if possible. The summit will allow the three Asian economic powerhouses to fine-tune differences and force collaboration and dialogue. This will help reduce tension and increase security in the region.\nFinally, the most unpredictable factor is the November US presidential election. It remains to be seen how both China and Japan will respond to a new president in the White House and broader strategies. Some recognised patterns or nuances of diplomatic overtures are expected to necessitate level-headed adjustments in their cooperation.\nHowever, for the time being, if both can improve ties and cooperation, especially on programmes and activities that involve increasing the Asean community's integration, green economic development and bridging digital divides, that will be a boon for the region.\nOtherwise, it could have negative impacts on their economies and existing supply chains.\nAsean will continue to respond to the new geopolitical landscape, especially the shifting ties between the US and the two Asian powers. Other tiers of powers that Asean has to tackle on the list include the EU, India, South Korea, Australia, and Russia.\nThe bloc foresees and expects tougher times and unpredictable circumstances ahead. As a group or as an individual member, Asean knows how to walk the tightrope to keep great powers engaged.\nKavi Chongkittavorn\nA veteran journalist on regional affairs\nKavi Chongkittavorn is a veteran journalist on regional affairs\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat type of accommodation do you usually prefer when traveling in Thailand?\nLuxury hotels (5-star)\nMid-range hotels (3-4 star)\nHostels and guesthouses\nPrivate rentals (Airbnb or villas)\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nGeopolitics\nAsean\nDo you like the content of this article?\n2\n20\nCOMMENT\n(4)",

The nation's currency recently approached a level seen as near-catastrophic during the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s. Authorities insist the ringgit is way too cheap and blame forces outside the country, chiefly high interest rates in the US. The remedies are modest, compared with the shock therapy meted out a couple of decades ago.\nThis time around, the government and the central bank have been careful not to encourage talk about reviving the radical solutions employed by former prime minister Mahathir Mohamad a generation ago: capital controls and pegging the ringgit. The treatment worked then, in the sense it wasn't the disaster that was widely predicted. By insulating the domestic economy, the steps staved off the need for an International Monetary Fund rescue. They also allowed Mr Mahathir to purge his deputy and finance minister, Anwar Ibrahim, now the current premier, who favoured a more conservative response to the crisis. By ring-fencing markets, Mr Mahathir could move without huge backlash from international capital.\nThe dramatic manoeuvres did leave investors with lingering suspicions that policy could veer off in unexpected ways. Officials appear to have decided that in today's far more complex global economy, adherence to orthodox positions and keeping their heads down will carry the day. They may be right. (Mr Anwar is leading a shaky coalition. His feud with Mr Mahathir, now in retirement, hasn't abated.)\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe steps preferred today are less explosive, but nonetheless betray the anxiety felt in Kuala Lumpur. The tools include occasional intervention to smooth the ringgit's decline, encouraging state-linked companies to repatriate funds and the constant talking up of local economic prospects. An appeal to patriotism never goes astray in Malaysia. The Ministry of Finance wants citizens to think about the ringgit in terms of adopting a \"Malaysia First\" approach to their lives, according to answers to questions tabled in parliament this month. This means a preference for domestic products over imported competitors, deploying cash at home and welcoming tourists.\nThere's nothing inherently wrong with a sense of national purpose. After South Korea's financial system buckled in late 1997 and the IMF was called in, with onerous conditions, broadcasts featured residents donating gold and other valuables to help out. Without appeals to sacrifice and the broader good, many leaders would struggle to push through unpopular but critical economic reforms. However, taken to extremes and manipulated for political purposes, invoking pride in country can be counter-productive. Some examples include Malaysia's national car, the Proton, which never became truly competitive and is now effectively controlled by Chinese investors, or Mr Mahathir's \"Buy British Last\" campaign in the 1980s over fees charged to Malaysian students by UK colleges.\nThe sensitivity of the central bank was on display in another form recently. Bank Negara wants an explanation from Alphabet Inc's Google for displaying incorrect exchange-rate data for the ringgit on March 15. The search engine showed the ringgit trading at 4.98 per dollar, perilously close to the psychologically important 5.00 line.\nThe bank also said that it had warned Google about erroneous figures in February. There's no suggestion of official sanction, but the ringgit now looks like the primary focus of economic policy, not just something that's a useful measure of investor sentiment toward, and reaction to, general approaches to policy.\nMight any of this mean a lasting turnaround in the currency's fortunes? For that, Malaysia will need help from the place that officials credit the slide: the Federal Reserve. At a press conference last week to release Bank Negara's annual report, Governor Abdul Rasheed Ghaffour pointed to a slide that shows the interest-rate gap between the US and Malaysia, and the US relative to other Asian currencies. \"Greater policy rate increases in other countries relative to Malaysia is one of the main factors causing the depreciation,\" he said. The slowdown in China also gets a mention. Abdul Rasheed warned of a \"bumpy\" road ahead.\nAlso lurking in the background is concern about the fractious turn politics has taken since 2018. The nation was governed by one party for six decades, but has had four administrations in six years. Bold economic reforms have become a secondary consideration, at best. Maintaining the numbers in parliament comes first. Mr Mahathir's two eldest sons told Bloomberg last week that their father is the target of a probe by the anti-graft agency.\nIf it really is all about the Fed, then relief may be in sight. Chair Jerome Powell has foreshadowed a couple of cuts this year. By implication, Malaysia just has to hang on and avoid doing anything rash for the next few months. In theory, less restrictive policy in America would dent the dollar's rude health. All Asian boats would rise.\nThat would be a reward for patience and, relative to past adventures, exercising prudence. If those Fed moves don't materialise, then the ringgit is in deep trouble. It's worth asking, 26 years after the controls were imposed, why is Asia still so dependent on the US for the direction of markets? Was all the talk about greater resiliency, the rise of China and supposed eclipse of US influence just blather? America clearly remains the indispensable player in the economies of Asia and the Pacific.

Is anybody listening?\nSingapore's Foreign Minister, Vivian Balakrishnan, is the latest to intervene, telling Israel that it had \"gone too far\" in its war against Hamas in Gaza. \"I have communicated that both to the prime minister, to the foreign minister, and to the other Israelis whom we have met,\" he said on Wednesday.\nThe tiny island state has been grappling domestically with the sensitivities of dealing with this issue -- just under a fifth of the population is Muslim. Like other leaders, Mr Balakrishnan condemned the horrific events of Oct 7, when Hamas militants killed 1,200 people and took more than 200 hostage.\nADVERTISEMENT\nBut since then, Israel's military has killed more than 31,000 Palestinians, the majority of them women and children, the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory says. An urgent solution is necessary, although there seems to be little hope of one anytime soon, despite ongoing talks in Qatar aimed at freeing the hostages and pausing fighting for several weeks. A famine will escalate the scale of death exponentially.\nWhich is why the the Global South -- a collection of postcolonial and developing countries that, by some estimates, represent 88% of the world's population -- has taken on the cause of Gaza so passionately: It feels like no one is listening. Australia and Southeast Asian nations have also called for a lasting ceasefire and the need to urgently upscale aid deliveries.\nRELATED\nlife\nFrom Vendome to Klong San\nthailand\n'Humans to blame' for devastating floods in Northern Thailand\nThe Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has advocated for the recognition of Palestine as a sovereign state before the UN. There are domestic issues at play -- Brazil is home to an estimated 60,000 Palestinian immigrants and refugees, including their descendants. Mr Lula has described Israel's prosecution of the war as genocide -- a position taken by South Africa, too, in its case in the International Court of Justice, but also, further afield, by Ireland.\nAt a St Patrick's Day celebration at the White House this week, Leo Varadkar -- an outspoken critic of the impact on civilians of Israel's war -- who until Wednesday was Ireland's prime minister, called for a ceasefire and an increase in humanitarian aid. This conflict has particular resonance for the Irish, given their own history of resistance to British rule. Ireland is one of the more supportive European nations to Palestinians and was the first to call for a Palestinian state in 1980. \"When I travel the world, leaders often ask me why the Irish people have such empathy for the Palestinian people,\" Mr Varadkar said. \"The answer is simple: We see our history in their eyes.\"\nThese comments have shone a light on the depth of feeling about the inhumanity of Israel's war in Gaza, not just among the political elite but also with the youthful populations of the US, the UK including Scotland, and Europe. Their words bear weight and are worth listening to. US President Joe Biden, one of Israel's staunchest supporters and the global leader most able to influence the course of the war -- by restricting weapons sales and pushing for an immediate ceasefire in the United Nations -- should pay attention to this growing tide of dissent.\nPerhaps no one has said this as eloquently as Malaysia's Prime Minister, Anwar Ibrahim, when he asked: \"Where have we thrown our humanity, why this hypocrisy?\" What he said struck a chord. In an interview on March 16 with DW News, the German public broadcaster, he asked why there is \"selective amnesia\" -- suggesting that the difference in treatment and attitude from some Western governments to the extraordinarily high civilian death toll and destruction of hospitals, universities, mosques and churches in Gaza, compared to Ukraine, has something to do with skin colour and the Islamic faith.\nOf course, Mr Anwar has ideological reasons to support the plight of Palestinians and has refused to cut ties with Hamas's political wing. Popular opinion is also causing him to speak out, given the strength of support domestically.\nIt would be easy to dismiss his demands given his roots in Islamic student politics and the dependence of his government on the goodwill of the strong Parti Islam Se-Malaysia (PAS) party. But he has long been an articulate voice on human rights, and what he is asking for is a transparent, consistent, and cohesive voice on these conflicts. He is not alone.\nThe Global South is stepping up as the world's conscience on Gaza. Their views are reflective of a far wider swath of public opinion than ever before -- and they need to be heard.\u2009\u00a92024 Bloomberg\nKarishma Vaswani is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering Asia politics with a special focus on China.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat is your budget range for purchasing a house in Thailand?\nUnder 3 million THB\n3 million - 5 million THB\n5 million - 8 million THB\n8 million - 12 million THB\nOver 12 million THB\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nDo you like the content of this article?\n9\n21\nCOMMENT\n(8)",

After the arrests, which grabbed global headlines, the Uyghurs were separated to face different destinies. The Prayut government sent 109 back to China, as requested by Beijing.\nNevertheless, 172&nbsp;-- mainly women and children were spared from enforced repatriation by the Thai government, and more than 100 were sent to Malaysia or Turkey to begin new lives, while 48 remained detained in Thai immigration cells.\nDuring the decade that followed, some of the 48 have suffered health conditions and passed away in custody. In April 2018, Aziz Abdullah, 49, died in the overcrowded Suan Phlu immigration facility in central Bangkok. Two months later, Mattohti Mattursun, a 40-year-old, passed away in a Bangkok hospital.\nADVERTISEMENT\nFollowing a decade behind bars with no apparent release in sight, a few managed to escape their immigration cells and run away to Malaysia.\nThat is understandable, too, especially considering that former Malaysian PM Mahathir Mohamad in 2018 released 11 of them and sent them to Turkey, disregarding China's request to hand them to Beijing.\nRELATED\nopinion\nPM has much to prove\nthailand\nUN \u2018rebuffed requests to help Uyghurs\u2019 in Thailand\nFor those left behind bars, making an escape to Malaysia became the only option for them to win freedom and get away from the violence in their old homeland and the claustrophobic interiors of their dank immigration cells.\nThe big questions are how much longer will they have to stay in detention, and what is the Thai government going to do next?\nOver the past decade, there have been accusations that international humanitarian groups have tried to help them and were always denied access. Meanwhile, the mouths of the Thai government and police officials have seemed zipped shut when asked about the case.\nIt is no surprise to hear rumours that Chinese authorities have regularly sent officials to check up on the detained Uyghurs during these 10 long years.\nIn making discussions about their present circumstances off limits, the Thai government has started tongues wagging among many about the influence China has here.\nThe truth of the matter is it is simply immoral to detain illegal migrants for 10 years.\nSo instead of kicking the can down the road and whistling while he walks, Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin, who proudly painted himself and his team of MPs as champions of democracy, must now show they have the backbone to resolve this conundrum.\nThe government must allow the National Human Rights Commission to visit, and it is about time the Uyghurs were granted access to opportunities to seek asylum in other countries.\nLest we forget, local law -- The Prevention and Suppression of Torture and Enforced Disappearance Act, 2022 -- prevents the Thai government from returning refugees and illegal entrants back to their country of origin if there are grounds that their lives will be endangered.\nThe government better act sooner rather than later. Do not forget that this year, the Thai government is vying for a seat on the United Nations Human Rights Commission later this year.

Xi's got bigger problems\nKarishma Vaswani\nPUBLISHED : 9 Mar 2024 at 04:00\nNEWSPAPER SECTION:\nNews\nWRITER:\nKarishma Vaswani\n&nbsp; Small\n&nbsp; Medium\n&nbsp; Large\n13\n11\nChinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi attends a press conference on the sidelines of the National People's Congress in Beijing on Thursday. (Photo: Reuters)\nThe script at China's National People's Congress is pre-determined months before the event, but there had been speculation this week that Beijing might name a new foreign minister. Instead, it seems senior diplomat Wang Yi will continue in the role.\nThe world's second-largest economy has missed a trick. While Mr Wang is credible, highly respected and well-known, China is increasingly losing friends and influence in the world and needs a new envoy to reset the tone and work to create some goodwill. For now, it is clear that domestic stability is President Xi Jinping's priority, even as tensions escalate across the region.\nNo surprise that among the foreign policy issues Mr Wang highlighted at an annual press briefing in Beijing on Thursday, the US, Taiwan and Russia were at the top of the list, along with relations in the South China Sea.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThat's not to say the long-serving emissary isn't doing a half-decent job. He has recently had tough talk for Europe, met with his counterpart in the US, and is expected to go to Australia soon in a sign of warmer relations there. Mr Wang may bring a steady hand, but he's also quick to call Washington out over its policies, particularly around China's access to advanced chips. \"The US has been devising various tactics to suppress China and keeps lengthening its unilateral sanctions list, reaching bewildering levels of unfathomable absurdity,\" he said.\nAlthough Mr Wang is repeating a lot of the old foreign policy tropes from the Communist Party doctrine and has yet to introduce fresh or new ideas, he is the picture of stability. He brings much-needed order to Mr Xi's chaotic inner circle after the previous foreign minister -- Qin Gang -- was unceremoniously and mysteriously removed just seven months into the job. The episode highlighted the secretive nature of the party's inner workings but also shone a glaring spotlight on Mr Xi's personnel choices, given Mr Qin was his pick.\nThe lack of a new foreign minister also highlights where Mr Xi's prime concerns lie, says Drew Thompson, visiting senior research fellow with the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy in Singapore. \"The domestic picture is the real priority, not foreign affairs -- other countries cannot bring down the Communist Party. Only the Chinese people can do that.\"\nSocial stability is the secret sauce that the success of the party is predicated on. The economic challenges facing China are acute, not least because they reflect the growing reality that it has lost its way. Indeed, projecting a strong and stable China to the outside world is part of the narrative that Mr Xi needs to convince his people that he's brought about a period of peace and prosperity, even if the reality on the ground feels somewhat different.\nWhich is why Taiwan is always a key focus in these press conferences -- although it's not what Beijing would consider foreign affairs. China claims the island as its own, and Mr Wang reiterated the long-standing policy on unification. He talked about the \"separatists\" -- those Taiwanese who want a sovereign independent nation -- as the most destructive elements in cross-strait relations and said that history would punish those promoting independence. Talking tough on Taiwan is a way for Mr Xi to build up his nationalist credentials, and a way to show strength while the economy around him flounders.\nThat means that there are more dangerous times ahead for the island. This is not new rhetoric, but the tone of China's annual policy report released this week hardened -- an indication that Beijing might view a stronger Taiwanese identity with a greater degree of concern. \"In the past, party officials have said the two sides of Taiwan Strait are one big family, and Chinese people won't fight with Chinese people,\" Wen-Ti Sung, a political scientist at the Australian National University's Taiwan studies programme and fellow at the Atlantic Council's Global China Hub, told me. \"That language has been removed. Beijing is projecting an increased sense of threat and urgency.\"\nThat will no doubt put pressure on the new government in Taipei and its partners like the US and Japan. There is increasing resistance to Beijing's actions in the South China Sea, too, which this week has been the backdrop for yet another dangerous collision between Chinese and Philippines vessels. A new foreign minister would go a long way to help explain Beijing's global viewpoint. A possible candidate is thought to be the former ambassador to the Philippines and Indonesia, Liu Jianchao. The fact that he was not announced should tell you that the focus for Mr Xi is what's going on at home, not overseas.\nThat may make sense in the short term. In the long term, it will result in a less influential and more insular China.\nBloomberg\nKarishma Vaswani is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering Asia politics with a special focus on China.

They have said they want to wait for the official results before conceding defeat, even though Prabowo has declared victory.\nIt is crucial for him to start thinking about the challenges ahead, both domestically, but also, importantly, on the global stage. The 72-year-old defence minister is inheriting Indonesia at a time of complex geopolitical issues. Gaza and Israel, the US and China, an assertive Russia, and an unpredictable North Korea. Although the archipelago has always maintained an independent foreign policy, Mr Prabowo will need to tread carefully -- and that's not something he's good at.\nADVERTISEMENT\nHe has remade his image as a cute and cuddly grandpa from the once forceful general, but some of that temper was evident on the campaign trail. In 2019, when he last contested the election, he told an unsuspecting foreign correspondent that he was \"not somebody who is afraid of white people\", and that he wasn't going to be lectured on democracy.\nNone of that vitriol or fury was apparent at his victory parade in central Jakarta on Wednesday. Beaming as he entered the packed Istora Senayan sports complex, it was obvious this historical moment wasn't lost on the man who tried to be Indonesia's president several times before. Many of the people I spoke to at the event were thrilled that Mr Prabowo was set to be their next president. \"He is a strong man,\" one woman to me. \"He will make Indonesia strong again.\"\nIt is a remarkable image makeover for a man with a checkered history. He was accused of the abduction and disappearance of student activists during the pro-democracy protests that eventually led to Suharto's resignation in 1998 amid street protests fuelled by economic turmoil. Mr Prabowo also headed the army's special forces unit, Kopassus, and was incriminated in alleged human rights violations in the former province of East Timor. He has consistently denied all allegations and, in this campaign, has appeared to shake off the past. We must focus on the future, he thundered to the crowd at his victory parade. It seems millions of Indonesians agree with him.\nCentral to that is a sense of pride and nationalism and a desire to have their place in the world. Joshua Kurlantzick of the Council of Foreign Relations notes: \"Prabowo definitely wants Indonesia to be seen as a bigger power in Asia and on the world stage -- to take back real leadership of Asean, play a bigger role in global institutions.\"\nAnd it will be on the international front that he may face the biggest challenges. The first order of business will be the relationship with the US -- which has been awkward, to say the least. He was banned from going there for two decades, ostensibly because of his alleged human-rights record, but Washington allowed him back in after he was selected defence minister in Jokowi's cabinet. Indonesia under Jokowi has been building close ties with both the US and China, and for the most part, Mr Prabowo is expected to continue with that, particularly in terms of courting Chinese investment, which has been a strong feature of this administration.\nThe superpowers' jostle for influence will no doubt be a key theme of Indonesia's future. The country, which is the largest economy in Southeast Asia, should, in theory, be a natural partner for Washington. It is a large, vibrant democracy with historically strong military ties to the US. Its economic prospects are relatively strong, and the archipelago no longer needs to kowtow to either Beijing or Washington to ensure its relevance.\nWhich is why Mr Prabowo's relationship with the US will be closely monitored by other regional partners, especially in an election year for both countries. It looks increasingly likely that Donald Trump could well be back in the White House. Asian governments are beginning to calculate what a Trump presidency might mean for them, and Jakarta should do the same. The combination of a Prabowo-Trump duo could be explosive. The two men, in some ways have some striking similarities. In 2019, after losing to Jokowi, Mr Prabowo refused to concede defeat, saying instead that he had won the election. Oftentimes, Mr Prabowo has echoed the American politician's campaign slogans, saying it was time to \"make Indonesia great again\".\nLike Mr Trump, Mr Prabowo is an unpredictable leader. He has yet to display Jokowi's ability for compromise and political manoeuvring. But Mr Prabowo will no doubt have his predecessor in the background, if not by his side. His vice president, Gibran Rakabuming Raka, is the current president's eldest son, and Jokowi's image has been plastered on Prabowo-Gibran posters. Indonesians voted for two politicians on their ballots on Wednesday to lead them into the future: In reality, they're getting three.\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg\nKarishma Vaswani is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering Asia politics with a special focus on China.

The Department of Corrections has said there are no records of Pol Gen Sereepisuth's visit.\u2009(Photo: Seri Ruam Thai)\nFormer prime minister\nThaksin Shinawatra\n's return to the\nThai political scene\nhas sparked a frenzy across all media spectrums. Such a brouhaha is understandable. Thaksin is a political figure associated with multiple scandals, an ideal target for investigative journalists. Interestingly, this time around, the expos\u00e9s are not coming from journos. Instead, they come from Thaksin's inner circle -- his close friends and former aides.\nIn the past, journalists utilised tools like the 1997 Official Information Act (OIA) to force state agencies to unveil state information that could benefit the public. Thailand was the first country in Asean to enact such free-flow information legislation. Two decades ago, when Thaksin was prime minister under the Thai Rak Thai Party, armies of investigative reporters used the OIA to reveal that he failed to disclose his wealth while serving in Government House.\nJournalists also uncovered how Thaksin transferred shares of his family business, Shin Corporation, to his driver and cook, allegedly without their knowledge. There were also other scandals involving officials from ministries involved in infrastructure projects.\nADVERTISEMENT\nToday, the media landscape has dramatically shifted. Traditional journalism, which emphasises fact-checking and editorial oversight, is overshadowed by the speed-driven dissemination of content on social media. This explains why Thai printed media is fading away. Today, influencers and YouTubers are popular news sources as they have -- or claim to have -- direct access to events and can bypass the rigorous standards of professional journalism. The priority is no longer accuracy but speed -- getting the story out first, regardless of its veracity.\nRELATED\nthailand\nPheu Thai MP to pull anti-coup bill&nbsp;\nthailand\n\u2018No public forum\u2019 on Cambodia pact\nWestern watchdogs often harshly criticise Thailand's media freedoms, focusing predominantly on lese majeste cases as their sole metric for assessing freedom of expression. This narrow focus misses the larger issue, the pervasive lack of professionalism in Thai media. The harsh reality is that the levels of media professionalism are not commensurate with the high level of media freedom in the kingdom.\nThe rush to publish has become the new media norm these days. The National Press Council of Thailand and the Thai Journalists Association are well aware of this trend. Indeed, they have appealed to media proprietors and content providers, both traditional and online media, to follow strict media ethics, but they often break the rules when they get big news. Such conduct has eroded the quality of content, leaving the public awash with unverified information, not to mention misinformation and disinformation. As such, the Thai press remains one of the most dynamic in the region -- a vibrant albeit chaotic media environment.\nToday, any Thai can now claim he or she is a journalist or citizen journalist and muddle through as nobody will fact-check his or her designation. Social media platforms are also inundated with self-styled commentators who often lack the depth of knowledge and rigorous standards that actual serious journalism demands. This has led to an environment where sensationalism thrives. Such news is branded as khao sai kai, or \"egg-covered news\", which means exaggerated or sensationalised news or information. This country's public discourse is often shaped more by rumour and speculation than fact-based reporting.\nSince Thaksin returned to Thailand last year after 17 years of exile, the Thai media, especially online platforms, has increasingly leaned into this sensationalist approach to attract viewers. Famous journalists, who have transformed from traditional media, often brag about their million-plus viewers. They urge their audience to share and \"like\" constantly. Doubtless, social media is riddled with comments from newsmakers, both veterans and wannabees.\nToday, the most prominent news commentator is Jatuporn Prompan, 58, a former red-shirt leader and once a staunch supporter of Thaksin. His daily appearances on TV and YouTube, where he shares insider knowledge of Thaksin's past and current do-list of political manoeuvres, have made him a media darling and a household name. Kudos must go to the damaging allegations he levels against his former boss. He recently said that he has seven to 10 interviews every day, not counting numerous interfaces with the journalists.\nJatuporn's prominence highlights a troubling trend -- the rise of \"negative X-factors\" in Thai politics, where political figures like him wield considerable influence by leaking scandalous details to the media. The diplomatic community in Bangkok often questions why politicians implicated in such expos\u00e9s remain silent. In other Asean countries, similar revelations would likely lead to defamation lawsuits, yet in Thailand, these figures continue to thrive in the public eye.\nThe ongoing public feud between Thaksin and former friend, Pol Gen Sereepisuth Temeeyaves, 70, is another case. Last week, the vindictive Pol Gen Sereepisuth --a former national police chief -- made headline news by publicly denouncing his 50-year-old friendship with Thaksin, accusing him of betraying him by not giving him a ministerial post. His revelations, backed by evidence, indicate a deeper rift within Thaksin's circle and suggest that even long-standing alliances are vulnerable in the cutthroat world of Thai politics. Pol Gen Sereepisuth's claim that Thaksin, on behalf of his sister, Yingluck, attempted to leverage their friendship to quash a legal complaint against former prime minister Srettha Thavisin only adds salt to the injuries.\nFor Pol Gen Sereepisuth, the media has become the best channel to send a clear message to Thaksin -- that his silence has a high cost or he cannot be bought. Apart from Jatuporn, the former police chief's knowledge of Thaksin's secrets makes him a force to be reckoned with. This shift -- where political operatives use the media to air grievances and settle scores -- has transformed Thai journalism into a battleground for power plays rather than a forum for objective reporting.\nUltimately, the uncertainties and absurdities of Thai politics have to do with the concept of boon khun, reciprocation or mutual obligation. Both Jatuporn and Pol Gen Sereepisuth highlighted this value. It is central to Thai political culture but has taken on a new, more transactional meaning for these two key whistleblowers. Their actions suggest that in today's political climate, boon khun is less about loyalty and more about leveraging personal ties for maximum political gain -- a \"give and take\" on a grand scale. One caveat is in order; one must be on the winning side.\nWhether this transformation of the Thai media is a boon or a bane depends on one's perspective. The public is inundated with constant opinions and allegations, many of which are more fiction than fact. In a culture where rumour often holds more sway than verified information, these narratives can shape public perception in powerful and self-destructive ways.\nKavi Chongkittavorn\nA veteran journalist on regional affairs\nKavi Chongkittavorn is a veteran journalist on regional affairs\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat type of hotel location do you prefer in Thailand?\nBeachfront resorts\nCity-center hotels (close to shopping, restaurants, attractions\nSecluded, nature retreats\nNear airports for convenience\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nThaksin\nThai politics\nDo you like the content of this article?\n60\n41\nCOMMENT\n(23)",

It is undeniable that Thailand has made significant progress on social issues, especially when compared with many countries in the West. But how long will the honeymoon last celebrating LGBTQ rights in a country with a very high-level of social intolerance towards LGBTQ people?\nToday, the protection of LGBTQ rights has been legalised, but the promotion of \"dignity\" among LGBTQ people remains a big challenge for Thailand.\nADVERTISEMENT\nDespite an overwhelming vote of 130 for, and four votes against the Marriage Equality Bill, with 18 abstentions, the last debate in the final reading in the Senate reflected a very typical view against LGBTQ rights and a societal perception which cannot simply be equated with the legal achievement and social tolerance towards the LBGTQ community.\nThis bill will certainly not change the anti-LGBTQ mindset in Thailand but it will promote and protect the rights of LGBTQ people here.\nRELATED\nlife\nBlack Doves is a strange bird\nthailand\nGovt gears up for new law\nDuring the final scrutiny of the bill, Gen Worapong Sanganetra, a former chief of the Defence Forces and a senator appointed by the 2014 Thai coup-maker, strongly condemned the bill, saying it will significantly \"corrode\" and \"destroy\" traditional families by using gender neutral terms such as two \"individuals\" instead of a man and a woman and removing a gender-assigned legal term such as \"husband\" and \"wife\" and replacing them with neutral terms like \"two individuals\" and \"spouses\".\nSenator General Worapong said the bill will not promote equality, but will instead bring male and female into the very same category as those who are classified as LGBTQ.\nHis implication is that LGBTQ people are simply not equal to males and females in his perceived \"normal society\". Indeed, this tone and argument are not surprising or unexpected because conforming to the superiority of a traditional gender identification has been one of the main obstacles for a society to embrace gender diversity and make progress in Thailand and elsewhere.\nIndeed, a conservative view from the Senate is in line with a recent study on the \"State of LGBTQ Rights in Thailand\", led by Assistant Prof Sakol Sopitarchasak, a lecturer at Thammasat University.\nHis research found that despite the advancement in LGBTQ rights and a more open minded younger generation who are not opposed to the promotion of LGBTQ rights and a marriage equality bill, there were some doubtful \"buts\" in their answers. A large number of responders remain reluctant and not very comfortable accepting a member of their own family if they identify themselves as LGBTQ.\nTherefore, celebrating the Thai LGBTQ community's legal achievement should not overshadow the difficulties that it and activists have gone through over the past two decades, during the fight for the bill.\nIndeed, politicians and businesses have perceived this bill as a window of opportunity since the start, as engagement in the process was equated with increasing popularity and marketability in the Thai political and commercial marketplace. No one has missed the boat as we have observed the excitement and enthusiasms in engaging with and getting involved in \"Thailand Pride\" in the past few years. It has been a MUST-GO event for most public figures.\nIn many villages in Isan, in Thailand's northeastern region, LGBTQ people still struggle to be accepted and given their dignity, and not treated as a commodity that can generate money.\nHow much can the Pheu Thai Party-led government ensure that LGBTQ people can live with dignity, when Isan remains crucial to the future of the party?\nWith its bid to promote \"soft power\", the party focuses on enhancing economic prosperity with very little attention to the promotion of \"values\".\nYounger demographic groups however are very receptive towards human rights issues as set in the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights: \"All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights.\"\nLiving a life with dignity in rural Thai villages is not what one can often experience, regardless of one's sexual orientation. Thus, the government's determination to educate wider society is crucial to promoting a better understandings about \"dignity and rights\".\nIn September 2023, Thailand announced its candidacy for the UN Human Rights Council for the 2025-2027 term, highlighting the government's commitment to \"advancing democracy and human rights\u2026\"\nThe legalisation of same sex marriage is a historic move, reflecting advancement in society, whereas the structure of power is largely controlled by conservative elements, which is well received by international communities.\nNevertheless, rights in the daily life of ordinary Thais still cannot be taken for granted, especially outside Bangkok.\nThe legalisation of the Same Sex Marriage Bill can only help facilitate Thailand's bid to sit on the UN Human Rights Council, but it is not a green light to do so. With such an achievement in advocating LGBTQ rights, Thailand must take this opportunity to demonstrate its commitment to promoting the \"dignity and rights\" of LGBTQ people at home and abroad.\nThis will not only enhance the country's international reputation but it can also promote a dignified life for LGBTQ people in Thailand.\nTitipol Phakdeewanich is a political scientist at the Faculty of Political Science at Ubon Ratchathani University.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat is your budget range for purchasing a condominium?\nUnder 2 million THB\n2 million - 4 million THB\n4 million - 7 million THB\n7 million - 10 million THB\nOver 10 million THB\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nLGBTQ\nDo you like the content of this article?\n8\n11\nCOMMENT\n(12)",

Critics, however, have raised a red flag that this not only distorts fact-based reality but also undermines the media's role in providing accurate and responsible journalism, potentially leaving audiences more misinformed and emotionally manipulated.\nThis was a major concern shared among media experts at a recent seminar hosted by the National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission (NBTC). They discussed whether sensationalised news programmes \"reflect\" or \"aggravate\" social problems. The conversation particularly aimed to tackle concerns about how licensed TV channels allocate significant airtime to sensational news, often leading to public complaints and administrative actions.\nPirongrong Ramasoota, NBTC's broadcasting commissioner, revealed that a recent survey of news programmes broadcast on digital TV during February and March showed that approximately 20 out of 30 programmes were deemed sensational news shows, making up two-thirds of all news content. These programmes often feature hosts who extend minimal content into lengthy discussions, emphasising sensationalism, emotional impact and dramatic storytelling over straightforward, factual reporting.\nADVERTISEMENT\nWhile this approach can be used to increase viewership and engagement, it may also lead to misinformation, biased reporting and a lack of focus on important news topics. Pirongrong added that several news programmes have faced complaints and administrative action over segments, including four cases of crime news, five cases of child and youth abuse, three cases of human rights violations, and four cases of violence stemming from conflicting opinions. News presented in a confrontational format aims to amplify and reinforce violence in order to evoke strong emotional responses from viewers and to create a sense of satisfaction and engagement.\nRELATED\nworld\nAustralia to ban social media for children under 16\nopinion\nRacial reversal\n\"[Some] producers may have good intentions to inform viewers about the incidents, yet sensational news programmes often inadvertently present physical violence that reinforces structural violence in society,\" Pirongrong said, adding that this calls for a critical reassessment of whether such news programmes should continue in their current form.\nAudiences have witnessed the use of sensational language and repeated display of inappropriate images, raising concerns about the ethical implications and the impact on public perception.\nIn many dramatised news reports, individuals involved are portrayed as characters, and events are coloured with heightened emotions. Some reporters may use irrelevant sources to highlight a character's traits without verifying their pertinence to the story. In a recent crime report, the journalist conducted an interview with the mother-in-law of a suspect's ex-wife, a person who had long divorced the suspect and was clearly not involved in the incident.\nTheema Kanchanapairin, a presenter on Channel ONE31, noted that current news programmes have significantly changed in format, from reporting and talks to sensationalism and variety. The shift began with experiments in presentation formats, particularly for evening and nightly news. These programmes started incorporating dramatic elements and storytelling techniques similar to those found in screenplays or movies.\n\"This approach gained significant popularity, enabling Thai news to outperform dramas in viewership. This shift has led to a new phenomenon in the media industry -- sensationalising news stories to attract viewers, boost ratings and increase advertising sales,\" Theema said.\nThis trend poses a significant challenge in the news industry. As a result, current news presentations often blend traditional news with new formats, such as in-depth reports and the integration of technology, to create programmes that are both entertaining and informative.\nSensational news often employs a variety of techniques to captivate audiences and evoke strong emotions. Language and narrative techniques include the use of hyperbolic language with exaggerated terms, crafting stories with strong emotional appeal, attention-grabbing sensational headlines, and suspenseful storytelling. Isolated incidents are used to generalise trends, conflicts are highlighted, speculative scenarios are presented as news, and expert opinions are dramatised.\nMeanwhile, vivid and disturbing imagery, music and sound effects enhance the emotional impact, and fast-paced editing creates a sense of urgency and provokes curiosity. Content selection and presentation techniques include selective reporting that highlights certain aspects while omitting others, repetition of sensational details, using celebrities, and focusing on emotionally appealing human-interest stories.\nThe increasing prevalence of sensational and emotionally charged news content has raised concerns about mental health impacts and decline in quality information.\nDr Worat Chotpitayasunon, a spokesperson for the Department of Mental Health, Ministry of Public Health, emphasised that the media industry faces significant changes due to economic and technological pressures, leading to the decline of state-regulated traditional media and the rise of entertainment content.\n\"Society's preference for emotionally resonant news, such as crime stories, has led to a format that emphasises detailed storytelling and emotional engagement. This approach can desensitise viewers to violence and pain, impacting mental health and societal perceptions,\" he said.\nIn addition to desensitisation, sensational news can influence audiences to \"learn\" harmful behaviours, such as \u00adcopycat suicide attempts detailed by news hosts. This type of reporting can also contribute to a perception of the world as an unpleasant and constantly threatening place, a phenomenon known as \"mean world syndrome\".\nThis shift towards light and entertaining content over in-depth reporting can hinder people's access to quality information and affect decision-making in daily life.\n\"The media plays a significant role in shaping our worldview and how we evaluate events. When entertainment takes precedence over informative content, it alters not just our news but also our decision-making and worldviews,\" Dr Worat explained, stressing the importance of media balancing engaging content with social responsibility to promote accurate understanding.\nThe phenomenon of sensational news extends beyond Thailand and television news consumption. Supinya Klangnarong, a Policy Committee member of the Consumer Council, pointed to Reuters research highlighting troubling trends in media consumption that sidestep quality news.\n\"Media outlets increasingly prioritise entertainment over in-depth reporting and thorough investigation. This trend is particularly evident in societies experiencing a rise in news avoidance,\" she said.\nResearch indicates a stark contrast between Nordic countries and Thailand in news consumption habits. For instance, 63% of Finns get their news directly from media sources, while only 7% of Thais do, with 60% relying on social media. This high reliance on social media in Thailand, compared to other Asean countries, suggests growing scepticism about media quality and reliability.\nSupinya stressed the need for the media to produce trustworthy content to aid in informed decision-making.\n\"The media must balance entertainment with social responsibility, providing both engaging and informative news to help citizens understand the world deeply and accurately,\" said Supinya, also a co-founder of the fact-checking organisation Cofact Thailand.\nThe Reuters research also revealed a correlation between press freedom and public confidence in the media. Countries with more press freedom tend to have more accurate and fair reporting, leading to greater public trust and a willingness to pay for quality news. In contrast, Thailand's lower confidence in media independence has led to a greater reliance on social media, which can sometimes spread misinformation.\n\"Thailand needs to enhance media standards to ensure true independence and quality reporting,\" Supinya added. \"Promoting media literacy is crucial for the public to distinguish between accurate and false information, fostering a well-informed society capable of navigating today's complex news landscape.\"\nAs technology and communication rapidly evolve, maintaining a reliable and comprehensive media is essential, particularly in combating misinformation on digital platforms and sensational news designed to boost advertising sales and public engagement. A strong and independent media is essential for guiding society through the information age with stability and fairness, Supinya concluded.\nAssoc Prof Alongkorn Parivudhiphongs is head of the Department of Journalism and Information at the Faculty of Communication Arts, Chulalongkorn University.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat is your budget range for purchasing a condominium?\nEkkamai-Thong Lor\nSathorn-Silom\nChidlom-Siam\nBang Na\nChinatown\nAri\nRiverside\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nMisinformation\nDo you like the content of this article?\n4\n1\nCOMMENT",

Her grandfather, Prapas, was Thailand\u2019s deputy minister of foreign affairs, and her father, Prapitwet, was a successful businessman.\nThis background gave her a global perspective that she now applies to her leadership roles, Ms Phanavika told the Bangkok Post.\nUpon graduating high school, her mother recognised her linguistic aptitude and sent her to study in China.\nShe recalled her time at Shanghai International Studies University as a transformative experience, immersing her in the intricacies of Chinese society and culture.\nAfter returning to Thailand for further education, Ms Phanavika enrolled in the Faculty of Economics at Kasetsart University, then later decided to pursue international marketing communication at Assumption University (ABAC), where she honed both Chinese and English skills.\nHer career journey led her through various roles, culminating in the founding of her own agency, The Fifth Haus.\nDigiLink Thailand stemmed from a chance reconnection with her Hong Kong friend, the managing director of DigiLink Asia, a Hong Kong-based firm providing online marketing services to brands targeting Chinese consumers.\nRecognising a shared vision, they joined forces to establish DigiLink Thailand as a subsidiary of DigiLink Asia.\nMs Phanavika holds 90% of the shares in DigiLink Thailand, while DigiLink Asia holds 10%.\nGIANT PARTNERS\nThe group secured a valuable official partnership with Mafengwo, a leading travel platform boasting more than 130 million downloads, she said.\nMafengwo\u2019s platform offers a comprehensive suite of travel services, including booking accommodation, flights and tours, catering to independent travellers.\nThe partnership with Mafengwo provides a crucial bridge for Thai businesses, connecting them with Chinese travellers and promoting their restaurants, attractions and services.\nA collaboration with WeChat further expands the company\u2019s services, propelling DigiLink Thailand to prominence among Thai and Chinese businesses, said Ms Phanavika.\n\u201cEven during the pandemic, we remained a trusted intermediary, serving clients who sought to position their businesses for future growth. We collaborated with the Tourism Authority of Thailand\u2019s Chengdu office, becoming the sole Asean tourism organisation to execute a successful, high-impact campaign,\u201d she said.\nThe Chinese New Year campaign via Xiaohongshu, a leading lifestyle platform, generated hashtags from users on more than 114 million posts, said Ms Phanavika.\nSOCIAL ENGAGEMENT\nShe said DigiLink Thailand has secured partnerships with key Chinese platforms such as Xiaohongshu (Red Little Book), which has 300 million users, and Douyin, a China-exclusive platform similar to TikTok, which has 600 million users.\nOther partners include WeChat, with 1.36 billion daily active users, Mafengwo, and Weibo social media platform with 260 million users.\nRecognising the growing complexity, Ms Phanavika restructured DigiLink Thailand, clearly defining operations for existing and newly acquired companies.\nEMPOWERING THAI FIRMS\nDigiLink Thailand has empowered more than 30 Thai companies to expand their reach into the lucrative Chinese market.\n\u201cWe provide in-depth recommendations, matching products with the most suitable platforms,\u201d she said.\n\u201cFor instance, if you\u2019re looking to sell cosmetics to Chinese consumers, we\u2019d recommend Xiaohongshu. We guide clients to the most effective platforms for their specific products, conducting thorough analyses of product strengths and weaknesses, identifying areas for improvement and optimisation to ensure success in the Chinese market. Our goal is to establish \u2018a true partnership\u2019 with our clients, where their success is our success.\u201d\nThe company\u2019s Chinese team takes the lead in crafting detailed media plans, outlining the strategies and platforms to be utilised. The Thai team contributes fresh ideas and coordinates the overall execution.\nThis dual-pronged approach, grounded in the principle of \u201cChinese content for Chinese audiences\u201d, sets DigiLink Thailand apart from other agencies that simply translate Thai materials for the Chinese market, said Ms Phanavika.\n\u201cWe believe in immersing ourselves in the Chinese mindset, understanding the nuances of their preferences and behaviours,\u201d she said.\nWOOING TRAVELLERS\nChina is a market with immense purchasing power and Chinese can travel to Thailand conveniently, without hassles.\n\u201cWhile the perception of Thailand as a tourist destination among Chinese visitors and investors is positive, we need to enhance their understanding of our unique offerings,\u201d Ms Phanavika said.\n\u201cIn my view, Thailand\u2019s future lies in developing every province to accommodate new travellers, not just from China, but around the globe. This presents an opportunity for them to spend their money in our country.\n\u201cWe must showcase our standout products and highlight the best of each province, emphasising cuisine and hospitality. We should plan for travellers to stay with us for four to five days, creating a mutually beneficial tourism ecosystem.\u201d\nShe said tourism opens doors, commerce promotes products, and a circular economy emerges.\n\u201cAs our products gain recognition, we must consider Thailand\u2019s future direction,\u201d said Ms Phanavika.\n\u201cThis chain reaction can have ripple effects throughout society.\u201d\nDespite China\u2019s economic slowdown, she said there is a lot of untapped opportunities in large and mid-sized cities with high purchasing power.\nAccording to Statista, China is the world\u2019s largest outbound travel market in terms of spending at US$262 billion.\nMs Phanavika said independent Chinese travellers spend 40,000-100,000 baht each per trip. If Thailand can attract 10% of this group, she said the income boost to the nation would be massive.\nAccording to Alipay data for Chinese tourists on Labour Day, Thailand was the No.6 destination, following Hong Kong, Japan, Macau, South Korea and the US.\nAccording to WeChat Pay, Thailand was the No.3 tourist destination on Labour Day, following Hong Kong and Macau.\n\u201cOverseas Chinese spending through Alipay has increased in 2024 by 77%. We need to use digital marketing channels to target independent travellers, persuading them to fly to our country,\u201d she said.\nLIVE COMMERCE\nIn the first quarter this year, online retail sales in China reached 3.3 trillion yuan, a year-on-year increase of 12.4%, said Ms Phanavika.\nService consumption continued to lead the growth, with online service consumption gaining 28.5%, including a 95% increase in online travel and a 27.8% uptick in online dining.\nIn China, there are special department stores where merchants live-stream products.\nRegarding Chinese products flooding the Thai market, she said if they are quality, affordable and benefit local buyers, the market should determine whether the goods are accepted.\nDigiLink Thailand brings Chinese brands to the Thai market, said Ms Phanavika.\nMost of the Thai brands with sales potential in China are fast-moving consumer goods, she said.\nFor Thai brands to succeed in China, Ms Phanavika said they need to have inventory, channel partners, and digital marketing strategies to address target markets and leverage live commerce to attract users.\nChinese buyers are now considering products with higher quality, indicating they have conducted research before purchasing, she said.\nThe insight of targeted customers and communication on effective social media platforms to potential buyers determines whether Thai brands can successfully sell in China or attract Chinese tourists to Thailand, said Ms Phanavika.\nBy the end of this year, she said DigiLink Thailand will launch a new platform called \u201cWei Tai Qua\u201d, meaning Hello Thailand, as a venue where Chinese tourists can book wellness, spa and food services in Thailand.\nCHINESE EXPERTISE\nAs the local digital agency landscape becomes increasingly crowded, DigiLink Thailand differentiates itself by acting as a trusted partner with strong alliances in China, Ms Phanavika said.\n\u201cWe believe our expertise in the Chinese market makes us an option for Thai brands seeking to expand their reach,\u201d she said.\n\u201cI spend two weeks each month in China to maintain close ties with our partners and clients.\u201d\nMs Phanavika said this commitment underscores her dedication to delivering results and upholding the company\u2019s reputation.\n\u201cDigiLink Asia Group plans to launch an initial public offering on the Singapore Stock Exchange within five years,\u201d she said.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nIf you were to buy real estate in Thailand outside of Bangkok, which area would be your top choice?\nChiang Mai\nPhuket\nPattaya\nKhao Yai\nKoh Samui\nHua Hin\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nDigiLink Thailand\nPhanavika Limpabandhu\nDo you like the content of this article?\n8\n11\nCOMMENT\n(2)",

06:39\nNEWSPAPER SECTION:\nBusiness\nWRITER:\nKomsan Tortermvasana, Wichit Chantanusornsiri, Phusadee Arunmas, Lamonphet Apisitniran and Kanana Katharangsiporn\n&nbsp; Small\n&nbsp; Medium\n&nbsp; Large\n8\n26\nAn aerial view of the Map Ta Phut deep-sea port in Rayong, one of three provinces included in the EEC.\nThe proposed Land Bridge project in southern Thailand is viewed by the current administration as a marker of its success in drawing foreign investment, similar to how previous governments regarded the Eastern Economic Corridor (EEC).\nWhile some officials discuss the two projects in the same manner, the EEC is operational and continues to be developed, while the Land Bridge is still a proposal.\nThe Srettha Thavisin government needs to balance supporting the EEC as it promotes investment in the Land Bridge proposal, as companies continue to invest in the corridor billed as a high-tech industrial hub.\nCOMPLEMENTARY RELATIONSHIP\nADVERTISEMENT\nKanit Sangsubhan, former secretary-general of the EEC Office, said the  government is prioritising the Land Bridge megaproject, similar to policy advocacy for the EEC by the former government.\nHe said both the Land Bridge and EEC are important projects for Thailand and can complement one another, attracting investment from both local and foreign investors.\nRELATED\nproperty\nCPN allots B1bn to enlarge Phuket mall\nbusiness\nFinance Ministry pegs growth goal at 3.5%\nIf the Land Bridge project is successful it will attract more investment to the EEC, making it a gateway to the global market through air transport at U-tapao airport and sea transport at Laem Chabang deep-sea port to the Pacific Ocean, said Mr Kanit.\nIf a deep-sea port is built in Ranong, products from the EEC can be transported to the Andaman Sea and the Indian Ocean.\nThe megaproject would forge a new link between the Pacific and Indian oceans through the construction of deep-sea ports in Chumphon and Ranong, linking them with a 100-kilometre expressway and rail network to transport goods between them.\nThe Land Bridge would cut shipping time by at least two days, with some ships diverting through the Thai bypass to avoid the crowded Strait of Malacca, he said.\nThe new route would facilitate the shipment of goods from Thailand to markets in India, Southeast Asia, the Middle East and Europe, said Mr Kanit.\nThe construction of a deep-sea port in Ranong will create a comparative advantage for investors who make products in the EEC, offering an alternative route to the Indian Ocean, he said.\n\"The Land Bridge will play a key role in driving the Thai economy in the long term,\" said Mr Kanit, adding the project is expected to link to the Southern Economic Corridor.\nThe project, which involves building two deep-sea ports, a motorway, rail lines, and gas and oil pipelines, should improve connectivity and trade along the Southern Economic Corridor, he said.\nWAREHOUSES\nApart from reducing logistics costs by an average of 15% by bypassing the congested Strait of Malacca, the Land Bridge offers an opportunity for related businesses, such as international warehouses, said Mr Kanit.\nFor example, Japanese companies that want to send products to Europe can store their goods in an international warehouse at the Ranong deep-sea port, with a similar warehouse in Chumphon for goods sent to Asean and Asia.\nThe most likely possibility is the establishment of an agricultural warehouse in Ranong to accommodate agricultural products from southern China, Laos, Cambodia, Myanmar, Thailand, Japan, Taiwan and South Korea to be exported to the Middle East and India, the world's leading importers of such products, he said.\nWhile the Land Bridge is expected to boost trade and investment in Thailand, the project routinely sparks concerns among local communities over its impact on their way of life and the environment.\nMr Kanit said the EEC can serve as a development model for the southern corridor, which includes an education system, community-based environmental protection led by women, private-sector investment in public health, and industrial promotion.\nNEW INVESTMENT TARGET\nChula Sukmanop, secretary-general of the EEC Office, recently said the office aims to increase the value of foreign investment to 100 billion baht per year, up from 70 billion annually, in an effort to upgrade the country's competitiveness via the digital sector.\nLast month the EEC signed a three-year memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission on collaboration to promote investment in the EEC, attract investment from innovation-driven sectors, and knowledge exchange.\nMr Chula said cumulative investment in the EEC totalled 2 trillion baht for the past six years based on Board of Investment promotion certificates.\nActual investment was around 70 billion baht per year.\nMINOR IMPACT\nDevelopment was slower than expected for some key infrastructure in the EEC, potentially having an impact on the property sector in the three eastern provinces that comprise the corridor.\nInvestments in industrial sectors have already been made, and new industries have entered to replace those moving out.\nPhattarachai Taweewong, research and communication director at property consultant Colliers Thailand, said while the slow development is a negative factor, the EEC projects will eventually proceed.\n\"The delay was caused by the pandemic, but everyone including investors believe it will still happen,\" he said.\nProperty developers that entered the eastern market are not waiting for the EEC infrastructure as demand exists, mainly from workers in several industrial estates where many residential projects posted healthy sales, said Mr Phattarachai.\n\"Driven by the China Plus One policy, the industrial estate market has experienced significant growth in the post-pandemic period, increasing by 2-3 times after the country reopened, compared with earlier,\" he said.\nLast year Colliers had many clients, mostly Japanese, interested in investing in warehouses and factories through joint ventures with Thai partners, said Mr Phattarachai.\nMeesak Chunharuckchot, chief executive of Chon Buri-based developer Life and Living Co, said the property market in Chon Buri, Rayong and Chachoengsao is active.\n\"If there is any slowdown, it is because of too much supply launched in the market,\" he said.\n\"If there is a delay in the EEC, it will have a minor impact on the market.\"\nDespite the departure of many industries from the eastern industrial estates, such as manufacturing of internal combustion engine automobiles, new industries, particularly electric vehicle (EV) manufacturers, are entering from China.\n\"Existing drivers like the China Plus One policy will continue to propel the industrial sector in the eastern provinces, but with new incentives the property market could experience even more growth,\" said Mr Meesak.\nFOREIGN OUTLAYS ESSENTIAL\nSanan Angubolkul, chairman of the Thai Chamber of Commerce, said the government has in the recent past consistently prioritised the EEC development project to attract foreign direct investment.\nThis effort was evident as Mr Srettha travelled abroad to persuade major companies such as Tesla and Google to invest in the EEC area.\nIf significant investors from any group invest in the corridor, the region is expected to thrive, creating momentum that will attract more foreign companies to consider the EEC area, said Mr Sanan.\nHe said businesses in the corridor informed the chamber there is ongoing progress on various plans within the EEC.\nOne trend observed by the chamber is an increasing number of Chinese investors in the EV industry from leading companies, in addition to a significant number of supply chain outlays, said Mr Sanan.\nInvestments are also occurring in the digital industry and sectors related to clean energy.\nInvestors from Japan and other countries are consistently expanding their commitments to the EEC area, he said.\nThese developments indicate foreign investors' readiness and confidence in the EEC development projects and global economic prospects as the world gradually recovers from the impact of the pandemic, said Mr Sanan.\nThese positive outcomes are the result of the government's sincere and continuous efforts to drive the EEC forward, he said.\n\"Some people may perceive the EEC project as quiet during this period, but the bidding is already open for various infrastructure projects, including ports, airports, roads, or high-speed railways connecting three airports,\" Mr Sanan said.\n\"Everything has moved as planned, leaving nothing to speculation. I suggest the government communicate more, especially about the progress of various public infrastructure investments to stimulate greater awareness.\"\nIn terms of the Land Bridge, he said it is a significant project the government is working to promote and develop, aiming to upgrade Thailand's competitiveness and economic growth.\nThe government is building understanding of the project with relevant stakeholders, while encouraging foreign investor participation in the investment, said Mr Sanan.\n\"Whether this project will materialise depends on foreign investor interest and their perception of the benefits and value of the project,\" he said.\n\"We need to monitor the progress of this project.\"\nEEC IN ACTION\nDevelopments in the EEC, including plans to build key infrastructure and invest in high-tech industries, remain active, which is expected to generate new economic value for the country in the future, said Kriengkrai Thiennukul, chairman of the Federation of Thai Industries (FTI).\n\"The EEC is not ignored or forgotten,\" said Mr Kriengkrai, also the board director of the EEC Office, commenting on the suggestion the government may be more focused on the Land Bridge project.\nThe FTI plans to sign an MoU with the EEC Office today to drive more investment in targeted industries, develop industrial clusters and upskill workers to match Thai manufacturing sector demand, he said.\nThese tasks can serve as a \"total solution\" for EEC development, said Mr Kriengkrai.\nThe government wants to develop the EEC, which covers parts of Chon Buri, Rayong and Chachoengsao, into Thailand's high-tech industrial hub hosting 12 targeted S-curve industries.\nThe industries comprise: new-generation cars; smart electronics; affluent, medical and wellness tourism; agriculture and biotechnology; food; robotics for industry; logistics and aviation; biofuels and biochemicals; digital; medical services; defence; and education development.\nAuthorities are pushing ahead with the development of key infrastructure under a public-private partnership.\nFive key infrastructure development projects comprise a high-speed rail system linking three airports; the third-phase development of Map Ta Phut deep-sea port; U-tapao aviation city; a maintenance, repair and overhaul centre at U-tapao airport; and the third-phase development of Laem Chabang deep-sea port.\nInvestment in some projects has been delayed&nbsp;because various economic factors changed, he said.\nMr Kriengkrai said factors such as the global economic slowdown and the impact of the pandemic affected the decisions of some prospective foreign investors.\nEVS LEAD THE WAY\nHowever, many businesses continue to invest in the EEC area, especially in the EV and EV battery industries, which are being promoted by the government.\nChinese EV maker Changan Automobile announced earlier it plans to start producing sport utility vehicles in Thailand in the first quarter of 2025 after buying 250 rai of land to build a factory in an industrial estate in Rayong.\nThe Chongqing-based firm wants to increase its investment budget to 10 billion baht, up from 8.86 billion, for expansion from 2023-25.\nThe higher budget is to support land purchases of 300 rai to build production facilities.\nMr Kriengkrai said he believes the EEC has the potential to draw more investors.\n\"The government is supporting both the EEC and the Land Bridge, though the effort to promote the latter is newer, which may make it seem this scheme is under the spotlight,\" he said.\nA man walks past a signboard promoting projects at U-tapao airport.

A new survey found a shortage of skilled labour in several industries.\u2009(Photo: Pattarapong Chatpattarasil)\nThailand needs to accelerate educational development immediately to align with the requirements of trade and investment as the educational system is perceived as insufficient in addressing the dynamic demands of rapidly evolving industries.\nAccording to Poonpong Naiyanapakorn, director-general of the Trade Policy and Strategy Office (TPSO), the current landscape of trade and investment, which is constantly evolving, and the rapid growth in technology development have prompted the workforce to rely on skills and thinking processes that respond to the labour market.\nThe trade and investment sectors have also reiterated their calls for improvements to the education system to enable the nation to produce a workforce that can fully meet the diverse demands of each sector, while some other perspectives argue that the workforce is still insufficient in certain industries, he said.\nADVERTISEMENT\nMr Poonpong said a survey of labour needs in investment-promoted projects by the Board of Investment in 2022 found a shortage of skilled labour, particularly in the machinery and automotive industries, as well as the electrical and electronics industry, accounting for up to 12,000 positions.\nAlthough Thailand's competitiveness ranking for 2023 indicated an improvement in the long-term labour force growth rate, he said there is a noted risk that the country may face challenges in terms of skilled labour, especially in the service sector.\nRELATED\nopinion\nPricey policies to curb climate change 'dead'\nthailand\nJoseph Stiglitz: A Path to Freedom for a Better Economy and Society\nAdditionally, there are concerns that competition from other countries in attracting investment is accelerating the development of their workforce in quantity and quality. This could make it more difficult for Thailand to attract foreign investment in the future, posing a challenge to competitiveness, said Mr Poonpong.\n\"Looking back at the quality of education in Thailand, which serves as the foundation for workforce development, an assessment of students' competencies in the Programme for International Student Assessment [Pisa] conducted by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development in 2023 reveals that Thai students' scores are consistently lower in all categories, including mathematics, science, and reading. When specifically comparing them within the Asean region, Thailand's scores are also lower than those of Singapore, Vietnam and Malaysia. Furthermore, there is a continuous downward trend,\" said Mr Poonpong.\n\"Analysing the issues within the Thai education system reveals a significant characteristic: the production of a workforce that does not align with or adequately meet the demands of the market. This arises from a value system that places greater importance on pursuing education in conventional formal paths rather than vocational ones.\"\nCoupled with the negative perception of vocational education, according to Mr Poonpong, there is a reduction in the demand for vocational education, leading to a significant shortage of skilled labour. This shortage hampers the country's ability to accommodate the expanding foreign investment and poses a risk of future labour shortages in certain sectors. Additionally, there is a deficiency in elevating the education workforce to have increased knowledge and understanding of technology in teaching.\nA study conducted by the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA) found that only 51% of teachers in Thailand use ICT equipment in their classrooms. This percentage is lower compared to South Korea (76%), Hong Kong (79%) and Australia (90%).\n\"Education is considered a crucial foundation for the development of a country because it represents an investment in human resources in the long term. Additionally, its development requires a reasonable amount of time and cannot be created or transformed quickly. Therefore, there is a need to expedite educational development starting to meet the needs of the country's industries through approaches such as surveying requirements to determine the varying needs in each field; increasing learning activities and practical experience outside the classroom, allowing learners to acquire knowledge from real-world experiences; developing educational personnel to effectively transfer new skills; enhancing the integration of related organisations, including the Education Ministry, the Labor Ministry, the Industry Ministry, and other relevant agencies in the development process.\"\nMore importantly, he said educational institutions at both university and vocational levels must have curricula to cultivate skills that align with the requirements of the digital economy or smart labour.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nHow much do hotel reviews (e.g., TripAdvisor, Google Reviews) influence your accommodation choice?\nVery important, I always check reviews before booking\nSomewhat important, I check reviews if I\u2019m unsure\nNeutral, I don\u2019t pay much attention to reviews\nNot important at all, I don\u2019t check reviews\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nEducation reform\nDo you like the content of this article?\n26\n4\nCOMMENT\n(15)",

Only 37% of organisations in Thailand perceive a high or very high risk of cyberthreats, the lowest in Asean.\nAmong businesses that were confident about tracking cybersecurity breaches, 22% claim the number of disruptive attacks has increased by more than 50%.\nHowever, Mr Tatchapol added that the lower number of disruptive cyber-attacks in Thailand compared to other Southeast Asian countries was based on the respondents' perception. It does not mean they should be comfortable with the results of the survey.\n\"Cybersecurity still needs to be at the top of the minds of management, as threat actors continue to evolve in their tactics and sophistication,\" he said.\nThe survey noted that 38% of local organisations reported that cybersecurity is discussed at the board level on a monthly basis.\nFurthermore, 49% of the respondents in Thailand have increased their cybersecurity budget due to optimising operations (54%), new or changing regulations stemming from data privacy laws (44%), increasing digitisation (37%) and the changing threat landscape (37%).\nMr Tatchapol said the top three cybersecurity strategies in Thailand include securing IoT/OT (43%), revamping threat detection and correlation systems/platforms (40%), identity and access management (38%) and security orchestration, automation and response (SOAR) strategies for the security operation centre (38%).\n\"Attack surfaces continue to expand with digital transformation. This is particularly apparent in industries such as the banking and financial sector, for which digital transformation is always expected, and competition is fierce,\" Mr Tatchapol said.\nOrganisations in Thailand, including those in the banking and financial industry, need to build robust IT infrastructure in order to ensure their readiness to tackle various security vulnerabilities, he said.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat hotel facilities are most important to you when choosing accommodation?\nSwimming pool\nFitness center\nRestaurants and bars\nMassage and spa\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nCyber\nSecurity\nDigital\nTransformation\nAttack\nCybersecurity\nDo you like the content of this article?\n2\n0\nCOMMENT\n(2)",

The United States, long a bastion of free trade and international cooperation, finds itself grappling with new priorities. The imperative to rejuvenate domestic industries, coupled with a shift toward the Indo-Pacific region, has culminated in the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework Agreement (IPEF).\nThe IPEF is not just another trade agreement; it's an emblem of the evolving dynamics of global economic engagement. It's an attempt by the Biden Administration to move the United States beyond traditional trade agreements following its withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership at the beginning of the Trump presidency.\nADVERTISEMENT\nIt is part of a reconfiguration of trade policy that focuses more on reshoring and domestic investment, emphasizing economic cooperation over traditional trade arrangements. This shift reflects a growing understanding of the interconnected nature of global economies and a recognition that broader economic collaboration can foster greater prosperity.\nThis ambitious vision faces significant hurdles. Reluctance among US lawmakers and policymakers to embrace agreements that could increase offshore investments or imports is palpable. The fear that such engagements may be perceived as benefiting foreign interests adds to this tension. This reluctance threatens to undermine economic engagement with strategic partners in the Indo-Pacific region, preventing the IPEF from being a meaningful agreement that will establish new norms on digital trade and provide discipline for customs and trade facilitation among other key priorities.\nThis reluctance is problematic for the region.\nOn this side of the Pacific, IPEF partner countries have made it clear from day one that they want to go well beyond the IPEF. Beyond stabilising supply chains and protecting worker rights, they seek greater access to US markets and a more liberalised investment environment to fund clean energy investments and infrastructure. Moreover, they are just as eager to see their own supply chains diversified.\nIt's no secret that nearly every country's largest trading relationship is with China. This has not happened overnight. Indo-Pacific economies have cultivated strong trade and investment relationships with China, whether through bilateral or multilateral arrangements, specifically the Asean-China free trade agreement and RCEP.\nBut, as with any economic or financial situation, dependence on a single revenue source is problematic. Just as US economic headwinds were cause for concern last year, China's economic headwinds are causing some trepidation now, and the European Union's economic situation remains stagnant.\nPartner countries are acutely aware that US domestic economic priorities are aimed toward reshoring and encouraging investment within US borders. At the same time, it's unclear if the IPEF will be legally robust enough to withstand a change in administration in Washington either next year or beyond.\nWith all this hanging over the agreement, the IPEF simply does not currently provide the deeper economic engagement the region seeks. This view also extends to the many US-headquartered businesses operating in the region.\nThose companies -- operating in sectors from tech to agriculture and mining -- have made it clear to the US government that their interests often align with those in the region when it comes to opening up trade and investment.\nGreater liberalisation will mean new markets for US exports, a stronger US economic presence and deeper economic integration. Moreover, they hope the IPEF is just a starting point, and that the agreement will provide an open structure that will lead to a full-blown free trade agreement in the future and a chance to regularly revisit the IPEF's scope and ambition until that time comes.\nWithout establishing proper discipline and norms in critical areas such as digital trade, express shipments, and trade facilitation, the IPEF may fall short of supporting US companies operating in the Indo-Pacific and their host governments. It would provide little counterweight to FTAs in place or underway with the European Union, China, and India.\nThis requires more than mere signatures.\nUS officials and negotiators must make a robust and long-term commitment to trade liberalisation across the Indo-Pacific. Immediate commitments to capacity building and comprehensive support for IPEF implementation are not mere afterthoughts; they are the sinews that will bind this agreement and make it a functional reality.\nIPEF partners also need to demand more. There may be the perception that this is a low-stakes agreement. Because market access isn't on the table, the agreement will seem economically benign. But this is where partner countries and businesses in the region must raise the stakes and call for a longer-term vision that promises greater commitments going into the future.\nJackson Cox is the Interim President of the American Association of the Indo-Pacific.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nHow important are environmental sustainability practices (e.g., eco-friendly rooms, waste reduction) when choosing accommodation in Thailand?

However, these products are still available on the market, and the government cannot ignore this issue.\nThe Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) and the Department of Health under the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration, which is responsible for food safety monitoring, need to step in and launch mass testing to locate unsafe products.\nThe FDA must warn consumers or force traders and exporters to recall chemically tainted fruits.\nBut the challenge is more than simply dealing with chemically laced fruits.\nThe big question is why non-profit organisations like Thai-PAN must carry out food safety testing and warn the public about such risks. Shouldn't it be the job of our government agencies to protect us from unsafe foods?\nFor the record, Thailand has had food safety risk management policies since 1999, with government agencies meant to monitor food safety in the market and local farming.\nFor example, the Department of Agriculture, under the Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives, is meant to monitor the use of chemical products in local farm products. But it has been criticised for supporting farm chemicals instead of reducing their usage.\nWhile the government's food safety risk management plans look convincing on paper, the reality is less so.\nTo begin with, the FDA receives about 40 million baht to cover all tests needed in the marketplace. However, this sum is only enough to test locally-made food products, not imported foods.\nMoreover, government laboratory abilities are limited. The FDA's laboratory can trace about 100 chemical residues, while advanced commercial-scale laboratories -- like the one that Thai-PAN uses -- can trace up to 500 types of chemicals.\nWithout active and reliable food safety monitoring, the Thai government's aspiration to be the kitchen of the world will remain a pipe dream.

(Photo: Reuters)\nThe stars truly aligned for Asian golf during one glorious Sunday in October as three young talents, Kevin Yu of Taiwan, China's Wenyi Ding and Kaito Onishi of Japan, put an exclamation point on the importance of the various global pathways that lead to the sport's ultimate destination, the PGA Tour.\nWith golf sustaining its international growth following latest data by The R&amp;A, where Asia remained as the leading region amongst R&amp;A affiliated regions for people engaging with the sport with a total adult engagement of 26.2 million, the multiple initiatives led by the PGA Tour are also beginning to bear their first fruits in recognising and accelerating the careers of aspiring young stars from the Far East.\nA first case in point is Kevin Yu, who proudly became the first Asian graduate of the innovative PGA Tour University programme to win a PGA Tour event following his breakthrough victory at the Sanderson Farms Championship on Oct 6. Yu, 26, had graduated in fourth place on PGA Tour University in 2021 following a stellar amateur career at Arizona State University to earn Korn Ferry Tour status, before playing his way onto the PGA Tour in the following season by finishing 20th on the KFT points list.\nADVERTISEMENT\nRecognising a gap that existed for non-US collegiate amateur players, the PGA Tour, along with the DP World Tour and R&amp;A, subsequently launched the Global Amateur Pathway (GAP) earlier this year to run in parallel with PGA Tour University, and reward the top-ranked amateur with a DP World Tour card. Highly-rated Wenyi Ding of China became the first recipient of this exemption after cementing his GAP No.1 status following a stylish victory at the Asia-Pacific Amateur Championship in Japan, coincidentally on the same day Yu triumphed in Mississippi.\nRELATED\nsports\nSuteepat one shot adrift at Taifong Open\nopinion\nVietnam gets ready for a new US-China trade war\nNow, all eyes will be on Ding, whom some have touted as a potential major champion, if he will follow in Yu's trail onto the PGA Tour via the DP World Tour route, which the top-10 players from its Race to Dubai ranking earn dual memberships on the PGA Tour annually. The young Chinese had to give up prized exemptions into next year's Masters and The Open, but said he was confident of qualifying for those majors as a professional golfer.\nThere is an old saying that good things come in threes and Japan's Kaito Onishi made sure of that by locking his top-30 status upon the conclusion of the 2024 Korn Ferry Tour season, also on Oct 6, to earn his PGA Tour card for next year. He will join compatriot Hideki Matsuyama, a 10-time Tour winner, and Ryo Hisatsune on the world's elite circuit and it will be a matter of time to see if Onishi, who moved to Los Angeles at age nine to advance his sporting dreams, will realise his twin ambition to become World No.1 and Masters champion.\nAs a seven-year-old, Yu, who is teeing up in this week's Zozo Championship in Japan, learned to play the sport through his father, who was a teaching professional at a local driving range. He blossomed into a leading amateur and won the Asian Games gold medal in the team competition in 2014 as a 16-year-old where he became firm friends with one of his teammates, CT Pan. It was Pan who encouraged him to take the US collegiate route to advance his golf career which Pan, a one-time TOUR winner, spent four years at University of Washington.\n\"The PGA Tour University programme provides a clear pathway to the Korn Ferry Tour and eventually the PGA Tour. This is an amazing opportunity. The system in the US is much more streamlined, giving players a faster track to the top,\" said Yu, who became only the third golfer from Chinese Taipei after TC Chen and Pan to win on the PGA Tour.\nFor a while, Ding, who rose to third position on the World Amateur Golf Ranking, looked certain to take the PGA Tour University option after joining Arizona State University last fall and establishing himself with a NCAA scoring record by posting a 27-under 189 total in a 54-hole event. He was also the first mainland Chinese to win the US Junior Amateur in 2022, but he opted to turn professional via the newly established Global Amateur Pathway.\n\"The Global Amateur Pathway has given me an incredible opportunity,\" said Ding, who finished tied 11th in his professional debut on the European Challenge Tour's Hangzhou Open on home soil last week. \"It was a hard choice [to give up the major exemptions]. But after consulting my family, I believe this will be the right decision. With the Global Amateur Pathway, it has also been really good for non-[US] collegiate players like me to make that decision.\"\nFor Onishi, whose idol is three-time PGA Tour winner Shigeki Maruyama, the hard knocks endured on the Korn Ferry Tour toughened him up. As a rookie in 2023, he finished\nNo.100\nto narrowly retain conditional status by 0.49 points which ensured he remained as a KFT member. A subsequent top-10 at the Astara Golf Championship presented by Mastercard in February opened up his playing opportunities and he later won the UNC Health Championship presented by Stitch, to essentially seal his maiden PGA Tour card. \"It's a dream come true,\" said Onishi, who was in tears when he called his parents and Maruyama after earning his PGA Tour card.\nAnd more dreams will certainly be realised in the years to come, thanks to the various global pathways, both for amateurs and professionals alike, that form golf's eco-system with the PGA Tour being at the centre of it all.\nThe writer is senior director, marketing &amp; communications -- APAC for the PGA Tour.

(File photo: Reuters)\nLONDON - The European Union (EU) voted on Friday to impose tariffs as high as 45% on electric vehicles (EVs) from China in a move set to increase trade tensions with Beijing, according to people familiar with the process.&nbsp;\nThe European Commission, the bloc's executive arm, can now proceed with implementing the duties, which would last for five years, said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Ten member states voted in Favor of the measure, while Germany and four others voted against and 12 abstained.&nbsp;\nThe decision by the EU comes after an investigation found that China unfairly subsidised its industry. Beijing denies that claim and has threatened its own tariffs on European dairy, brandy, pork and automobile sectors.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe bloc is actively trying to reduce its dependencies on China, with former European Central Bank President Mario Draghi warning last month that \u201cChina's state-sponsored competition\u201d was a threat to the EU that could leave it vulnerable to coercion. The EU, which did \u20ac739 billion (US$815 billion) in trade with China last year, was split on whether to move forward with the duties.\nThe EU and China will continue negotiations to find an alternative to the tariffs. The two sides are exploring whether an agreement can be reached on a mechanism to control prices and volumes of exports in place of the duties.\nRELATED\nbusiness\nEU imposes tariffs on China EVs, risking retaliation\nopinion\nChina's interface with AI development\nThe European Commission, the bloc's executive arm, has repeatedly said that any alternative to tariffs must have strict requirements, including alignment with World Trade Organization (WTO) rules, address the impact of China's subsidies and be something the EU can monitor for compliance.\nEmployees work on an electric vehicle (EV) production line during an organised media tour to a factory under Jiangling Group Electric Vehicle (JMEV), in Nanchang, Jiangxi province, China, on May 22, 2024. (Photo: Reuters)\nThe new tariff rates will be as high as 35% for EV manufacturers exporting from China. The new duties would be on top of the existing 10% rate.\nChinese EV makers will have to decide whether to absorb the tariffs or raise prices, at a time when slowing demand at home is squeezing their profit margins. The prospect of duties has prompted some Chinese automakers to consider investing in factories in Europe, which might help them dodge tariffs.\nThe additional tariffs already have slowed Chinese carmakers' momentum in Europe, with their sales plunging 48% in August to an 18-month low. The region is a desirable destination for the nation's manufacturers because EVs sell in relatively high numbers and at much more robust prices than other export markets.\nThe share of electric cars sold in the EU that were made in China climbed from around 3% to more than 20% in the past three years. Chinese brands accounted for around 8% of that market share, as international companies that export from China including Tesla Inc taking up the rest.\nStill, Europe\u2019s tariff hike will have a \"minor impact\" on Chinese manufacturers because the region accounts for only a fraction of their total sales, according to Daiwa Securities analyst Kevin Lau. Europe contributed 1% to 3% of overall sales for Build Your Dreams (BYD) Co, Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co and Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation (SAIC) Motor Corp in the first four months of this year, he estimated.\nWhile Brussels has sought a level playing field for European companies, Germany\u2019s automakers are concerned about blowback that could exacerbate challenges they\u2019re already having in their most important market globally. Mercedes-Benz Group Aktiengesellschaft (AG) and Bayerische Motoren Werke (BMW) AG pressed Berlin to vote against the higher tariffs and urged the EU to negotiate with Beijing.\nGerman automakers including Volkswagen AG, Mercedes and BMW would be hit hardest in a trade spat as China accounted for roughly a third of their car sales in 2023.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nHow important are environmental sustainability practices (e.g., eco-friendly rooms, waste reduction) when choosing accommodation in Thailand?

Since the ruling party holds a majority in the National Diet (parliament), Mr Ishiba will be Japan's next prime minister. For the 67-year-old Mr Ishiba, long a leading rival of the late Shinzo Abe, ascending to the post is the realisation of a long-held dream. But Mr Ishiba's political star will likely soon fall.\nThere are several reasons for this. For starters, Mr Ishiba's proposal of an \"Asian Nato\" is utterly unrealistic and will not withstand debate in the Diet. While Mr Ishiba portrays himself as a security expert, he seems to lack some fundamental perspective.\nNato's defining feature is its guarantee of mutual defence: an attack on a member state is regarded as an attack on one's own country. Japan, through Abe's tireless efforts, achieved partial collectivisation of self-defence back in 2015. But, reflecting strong domestic anti-military sentiment, the scope for collective self-defence was limited to situations where Japan's survival was at stake.\nADVERTISEMENT\nAn Asian Nato, by contrast, implies Japan would have to be ready to assist if, say, the US were attacked in the Indian Ocean. Likewise, should Australia, a likely member state, clash with the Chinese navy, Japan would need to engage in collective self-defence.\nRELATED\nthailand\nAt least 3 killed, scores injured in grenade attack at Tak fair\nthailand\nCommission fears low turnout in polls\nPerhaps Mr Ishiba's main intention is to institutionalise US involvement in the Indo-Pacific more firmly. In that case, he would need to present arguments for how an Asian Nato would be a net gain for the US. An Asian Nato would change little from today's arrangements, whereby Japan hosts the bulk of America's forward-deployed combat power in Asia -- forces which continually carry out active joint exercises with Australia and India to remind China of the high cost of military adventurism.\nThat brings us to an even more serious problem with Mr Ishiba's proposal: Taiwan. Should Taiwan come under the control of China's Communist regime, Japan's strategic sphere would be significantly constricted -- psychologically, militarily, and commercially. Would other countries join an Asian Nato whose most worrying point of defence is Taiwan? The prospects for this seem bleak.\nAnd then there's the question of India. When Abe brought India into the Quad, alongside the US, Japan, and Australia, he did so in the knowledge that India, constantly in tension with neighbouring China, wanted to maintain its longstanding relationship with Russia. Even as it joins the Quad, India would likely refuse to join an Asian Nato rather than risk that relationship. Testing India in this regard should be avoided.\nMr Ishiba's political prospects are also burdened by his call for tax increases -- both personal and corporate income taxes, and he has shown enthusiasm for taxing capital gains as well. Does he genuinely believe that he can win an election on a platform of tax hikes?\nAnd the LDP's need to prevail in the coming elections is the main reason Mr Ishiba was chosen. The House of Councillors (the Upper House) renews half of its seats every three years, with the next election scheduled for July 2025. The current term of the House of Representatives (the Lower House) lasts until October 2025. Mr Ishiba will probably use this opportunity to dissolve the Lower House and call an election to secure a majority and boost his administration. If he fails to dissolve the house in the coming months, he may hold elections for both houses next July.\nFortunately for him, Japan's economy is not in bad shape. Nominal GDP is at an all-time high, as are tax revenues. But private-sector demand has not fully recovered, suggesting that this is no time for a tax hike.\nA third key reason to doubt Mr Ishiba's political longevity concerns the loyalty of those who form his government. When a Japanese administration is short-lived, its demise generally results from scandals involving cabinet ministers or defections within the prime minister's entourage in the Kantei, or the Prime Minister's Residence.\nMr Ishiba previously served as Minister of Defence. I have always been struck by the uniformity of their reaction when asked about Mr Ishiba's tenure. They offer no clear answers, but uniformly frown when responding.\nThe prime minister's responsibilities are far more daunting than the defence minister's. Some 99% of the job is dealing with setbacks.\nMoreover, Japan's Diet demands 7.4 times more of the prime minister's time than the British Parliament does of its prime minister.

(Photo: Pattarapong\u200b Chatpattarasil\u200bl)\nThailand's US$53 billion automobile industry is facing a grim future as highly indebted domestic consumers struggle to finance purchases and overseas buyers of its mainstay traditional vehicles increasingly switch to electric alternatives.\nThe crisis in Southeast Asia's largest car production hub has forced cuts to output and jobs, and sparked measures from the government to try and reverse its fortunes.\nIt is already rippling through companies such as Techno-Metal which has been manufacturing cast iron undercarriage parts for Japanese car makers including Toyota Motor and Mitsubishi Motors for more than three decades.\nADVERTISEMENT\nProduction at the company's two factories in Thailand's Chon Buri province is currently only 40% of peak capacity, and its workforce has steadily declined as orders have eroded, said Deputy General Manager Nattaporn Chewapornpimon.\n\"At the end of last year, there were about 1,200 workers. Now, there are 900 left,\" she said. \"We've also reduced working hours to 75% and cut overtime.\"\nRELATED\nbusiness\nTrends drive job openings\nthailand\nSikhio Smart Living: Redefining Thailand's Smart City Future\nProduction in Thailand's automobile industry has been on a downward trend for the last year, sliding 20.6% in August on a yearly basis. And domestic sales fell to their lowest in 14 years on a 12-month moving average basis, industry data showed.\nRead more:\nCar slump in August causes panic\nThe auto industry is forecasting Thailand to produce 1.7 million vehicles this year, down from 1.9 million in 2023. Of that, 550,000 vehicles are expected to be sold domestically and 1.15 million exported.\n\"It's a crisis, quite a serious one, with no easy way out,\" said Hajime Yamamoto, a principal at Nomura Research Institute's consulting division in Thailand, adding that the stagnant home market, combined with increased competition in exports is squeezing the auto sector.\nThe fast-growing electric vehicles (EV) sector, which has drawn investments of over $1.44 billion from Chinese EV makers such as BYD (Build Your Dreams), is unable to pick up the slack in output for the local auto parts industry which has about 2,000 companies and employs about 700,000 workers.\n\"The Thai cost structure is 30% higher than the Chinese,\" said Sompol Tanadumrongsak, President of the Thai Auto-Parts Manufacturers Association.\n\"Thai businesses can't really do it.\"\nTrouble with trucks\nAt the heart of the troubles for the Thai auto sector is the pick-up truck segment, which contributed nearly half of all Thailand's vehicle sales last year, and is a fixture on its roads, from the jam-packed Bangkok streets to rural trails.\nIn 2023, more than 820,000 pick-ups were exported, or 67% of total produced, according to official data.\nThis year so far, pick-up truck exports have dropped 8.76% annually, with production down 20.51% annually to 616,549 units, data shows.\nThis has hit Thai firms because more than 90% of parts of pick-up trucks are manufactured locally, and the segment alone makes up 70% of the domestic parts market, according to the auto parts association.\nSales of auto parts are seen down nearly 12% this year at 519 billion baht ($15.68 billion), the research unit of Kasikornbank said in a September report.\n\"If auto parts SMEs close today, they are not coming back,\" said Mr Sompol of the auto parts association, adding the situation was worse than it was during the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s and the coronavirus pandemic at the turn of this decade.\nIf it's left this way - we'll all die.\"\nThe main culprit is household debt of $484 billion, or 90.8% of Thailand's gross domestic product (GDP) as of March 2024, among the highest ratios in Asia, which has put the brakes on car sales.\nIn the first six months of 2024, financial institutions approved about 203,000 pick-up loans, compared to 722,000 for all of 2019, credit bureau data showed.\nThe credit situation is so tight across multiple consumer segments that Thailand's main EV manufacturers' association has halved its sales forecast for 2024.\nExisting car owners are also struggling to pay back their loans.\n\"Pickup truck NPLs started to show in the first quarter of 2022,\" said Surapol Opastien, head of the National Credit Bureau, referring to non-performing loans (NPLs) that have since surged 40% year-on-year to 148 billion baht ($4.46 billion).\nIncentives planned\nIndustry groups are now scrambling to find solutions, with the auto parts sector pushing the government for more incentives to foreign manufacturers of traditional internal combustion engine (ICE) and hybrid cars.\n\"We want to be the last man standing in ICE, especially in pick-up trucks, and hybrid production ... draw auto makers to move that production here,\" said Mr Sompol of the parts group.\nThe government plans to offer investment incentives and subsidies for hybrid manufacturing.\n\"The Japanese have also adapted to hybrid technology to compete and still need parts,\" said Surapong Paisitpattanapong, of the Federation of Thai Industry's (FTI) automotive division.\nThailand's Board of Investment is also trying to entice foreign investors to form joint ventures with local auto part companies.\n\"This will change Chinese EVs into Thai EVs, which can then be exported,\" said EV association head Suroj Sangsnit, pointing to tariffs on China-made cars from the United States, EU and India.\n\"There is nothing other than this that can improve the situation.\"\nBut for some Thai firms, working with Chinese EV makers has been a challenge, including because of pricing differences.\n\"Even if we can (supply Chinese EVs), the profits are low,\" said Techno-Metal's Nattaporn.\n\"We still have to focus on OEM (original equipment manufacturing) for Japanese brands.

On the ensuing hole, a par-five, he found the trees on the right with his tee shot but played a miraculous recovery shot. His ball found a bad lie, entangled in tree branches, but he was able to chip back into the fairway and hit his third to 12 feet, which he just missed for birdie.\nOn the treacherous par-three 16th, where a tough pin position on the right brought a greenside lake dangerously into play, he holed a 15-footer for birdie to virtually wrap up the title. The look of relief on his face was tangible as his ball would have rushed past the cup if it had not dropped.\nIt meant he had a four-shot lead from Surratt, which became five when Surratt made bogey on 17. It was then six when Uihlein holed a 12-footer for birdie on 17, and a magnificent seven when he birdied the par-five 18th.\n\"Bit of a dream, really,\" said Uihlein, who plays for RangeGoats GC on LIV Golf.\n\"I mean, I was two over par through eight holes on the first day. I tripled 17, and it was a bit of a grind that day, and then the next day I just kind of blitzed it, and yesterday kind of survived. And today I kind of had some things going my way, no doubt about it. So just kind of one of those days where things were going my way, and I took advantage of it. So, I'm happy to be here.\"\nHe earned a cheque for US$360,000 and moves into third on The International Series Rankings, which is still being led by American John Catlin.\nBoth Sullivan and Surratt, playing together, missed makeable birdie putts on the last to snatch second place outright.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat is your budget range for purchasing a house in Thailand?\nUnder 3 million THB\n3 million - 5 million THB\n5 million - 8 million THB\n8 million - 12 million THB\nOver 12 million THB\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nGolf\nPeter Uihlein\nDo you like the content of this article?\n1\n0\nCOMMENT",

Blink and you\u2019ll miss another new restaurant opening or a drink launch. Guru By Bangkok Post is making sure that even if you blink, you don\u2019t miss out on the new taste tinglers that are worth mentioning.\nBeer Pradith\nA new bar on the up and coming Banthat Thong Road, Beer Pradith serves a collection of Thai craft beers from four regions, all on 24 taps.\nADVERTISEMENT\nFounded by a group of people that love beer (duh!), the name is a combination of Thai words. Pradith is the Thai word for \u201ccraft\u201d and well, we all know what beer is.&nbsp;\nRELATED\nlife\nNew taste tinglers for your palate\nlife\nNew taste tinglers for your palate\nAlong with serving local craft beer, the bar has also launched two new beers in the market. The Banthat Thong Golden Ale and Samyan Triple IPA will only be available at Beer Pradith. &nbsp;The 24 Thai craft beer taps have been collected from brewers in the four regions of the country and the bar aims at supporting small entrepreneurs.&nbsp;\nThe 24 beers are rotated regularly to ensure that everyone in the market is represented. The bar even has a \u201cBeertender\u201d, who will expertly guide guests seeking new flavours and recommendations.&nbsp;\nThe launch beers at Beer Pradith are those produced by Saha Prachachuen Brewery (United People Brewery), which makes the Banthat Thong Golden Ale and Samyan Triple IPA. The former has a golden colour with a fruitiness aroma.\nNot too bitter, smooth and easy to drink. The Samyan Triple IPA is a collaboration of Saha Prachachuen Brewery and Beer Pradith. The New Zealand hops gives the beer a fruity flavour, along with a little bit of berries. Though the alcohol content is 9%, the body is designed to be light.\nCoolies Club\nDesigned by Bill Bensley, the Coolies Club recently opened on Soi Romanee in Phuket Old Town.&nbsp;\nThe Slate Phuket\u2019s sister venue celebrates the island\u2019s rich mining history and pays homage to the area\u2019s colourful past. Located in a traditional Sino-Portuguese shophouse, the new restaurant and bar tells the history of Soi Romanee, which was once Phuket\u2019s red-light district. This was where tin miners would visit brothels, gambling houses and opium dens. Today, the street is more famous as an Instagrammer\u2019s dream, with its vibrant colours and colonial architecture.\nThe Coolies Club also ties back to the family history of The Slate\u2019s owner, Krystal Prakaikaew Na-Ranong. Krystal\u2019s great-grandfather came from China in 1912 and began working as a miner. As a reward for his hard work and loyalty, he was given land parcels and mining rights by his employer. In those days, foreign labourers were known as \u201ccoolies: and the club is named in honour of Krystal\u2019s great-grandfather and all the other hard workers who played a role in Phuket\u2019s foundation.\nThe restaurant features Chinese Baroque architecture, with ornate wooden doors, intricate Chinese fretwork and a striking fa\u00e7ade in white, turquoise and antique red. Inside, Bensley has created a moody, sexy interior that harks back to the area\u2019s famous opium dens using antique furnishings, rich materials and gorgeous shades of coral, turquoise and jade green. Guests can enjoy a themed list of creative cocktails including the Miner\u2019s Whisper, Mama\u2019s Twist, Spicy Maria and Courtesan\u2019s Kiss alongside bar bites and bigger plates.&nbsp;\nThe venue features two private bedrooms, where Opium Den dining experiences will be offered. The bar plans to work with local artists, DJs, performers and musicians to bring themed events to the space. Paying respect to the methods by which tin miners cooked their food, the restaurant uses smoking over an open fire for many of its dishes.\nFeaw Thai restaurant\nServing Thai comfort food, Feaw by Piti \"Todd\" Bhirombhakdi and chef Pakpoom \"Art\" Suwantamee, recently opened at the Racquet Club's RQ Bite49 on Sukhumvit 49.\nChef Art describes his menu as \"comfort Thai dishes that are from his memory and travelexperiences. \u201cIf it\u2019s not special, we don\u2019t serve,\u201d he adds. Open for lunch and dinner, Feaw serves sharing portions and the menu is divided into appetisers and main courses. There are also \"Feaw Single-Dish Meal\", should you need a snack after working out, and \"Feaw Noodle\" dishes, which come in a variety of toptions.&nbsp;\nDishes that shouldn't be missed are the Fried chives cake served with a dipping sauce. It's all about the crispiness of the chives until the last piece, despite dunking it into the sauce. The Deep-fried pork belly with fish sauce served with a spicy fermented fish dipping. The spicy fermented dipping is chef Art's secret recipe, also known in Thai as \"jaew pla ra\". It may sound funky, but it's rather mellow and goes well with the pork. Continuing with the fried food, try the Deep-fried beef jerky served with a chilli sauce, Deep-fried calamari or Deep-fried wontons filled with minced pork and shrimp.&nbsp;\nSingle dish highlights are the quintessential Stir-fried Thai basil with minced beef. Here chef Art uses wild basil for its aroma that goes perfectly with the Australian beef. The pad krapao also comes in a crispy pork version. Dishes from yesteryears include Thai mackerel fried rice served with chilli fish sauce, which is an aromatic fried rice served with deep-fried mackerel, chilli, shallots and lime. Shrimp pink sauce fried rice uses pink fermented bean curd, similar to yen ta foo. There are dishes for seafood lovers, as well. Think Steamed crab rice served with one of my favourite things to come out of Thai cuisine \u2014 Thai seafood sauce.\nThe noodle dishes include Egg noodles with pork where chef Art uses Hong Kong-style eggnoodles for texture. Steamed beef with spicy sauce uses the part of the cow that chef Art calls \" crispy drum\". &nbsp;You'll have to visit Feaw to learn more about that one. Desserts are simple like Soft serve ice cream that come with a choice of toppings. There is also Steamed toast with pandan and Thai tea custard.&nbsp;\nEnoteca\nEnoteca welcomes a new head chef, Federico Orr\u00f9, who comes from Milan.\nChef Orr\u00f9 brings extensive experience from renowned Michelin-starred restaurants, including Paul Bocuse, Lyon, France; Jan, Nice, France; Le Table de Xavier Mathieu, Joucas, France; and The Roots, Fluelen, Switzerland.

Reservation is required and there is limited availability per round.&nbsp;\nNapasai, Koh Samui\nThe Belmond hotel has announced a new executive chef, Mauricio Reyes Corti, for the Beach Restaurant and Lai Thai Restaurant.&nbsp;\nWith more than 20 years of culinary expertise and a journey that spans countries rich in gastronomic traditions, Uruguayan-Italian chef Corti brings a wealth of experience to Napasai. \"I focus on clean and pure flavours with the aim of respecting each ingredient's integrity. The menus highlight the richness of local produce, celebrating the unique environment surrounding us.

Although Thailand has aspired to \"go nuclear\" for almost four decades, valid fears -- solidified by tragic accidents at nuclear power plants in Chernobyl in Ukraine in 1986 and Fukushima in Japan in 2011, as well as domestic accidents involving radioactive waste -- remain about whether Thai-style management can cope with technology so reliant on highly efficient, transparent and trustworthy leadership.\nThis time, the government expects less resistance as it has downsized its aspiration of operating a large-scale traditional nuclear reactor to running a \"small modular reactor\" (SMR), with a capacity of up to 300 megawatts per unit, about one-third of the generating capacity of larger, traditional nuclear power plants.\nADVERTISEMENT\nSMR technology, known for its portability and less demanding infrastructure development, has a swiftly growing reputation. Russia's Akademik Lomonosov, which became the world's first floating nuclear power plant in May 2020, produces energy from two 35 MW(e) SMRs. More than 80 commercial SMR facilities, either under construction or in the licensing stages, are currently being developed in Argentina, Canada, China, Russia, South Korea and the United States of America, among others.\nRELATED\nthailand\nFeeding energy-hungry AI tech advances\nopinion\nThreat of WW3\nThe Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (Egat) expects to build two 300MW plants with a view to seeing them become fully operational by the end of 2037. If successful, they will be the country's first nuclear power plants. Egat had been plotting the development of a large-scale pilot nuclear plant between 2009 and 2011. However, that scheme was shelved following the Fukushima incident, when a massive earthquake and tsunami triggered a nuclear reactor meltdown and radiation leak at Japan's coastal nuclear facility in March 2011.\nWhile the SMR technology sounds promising, the government cannot expect the general public to support the plan so easily. Lest we forget, the use of nuclear technology has been small and limited to medical and industrial tasks. Accidents related to the mishandling of radioactive waste have already eroded trust in the Thai government's ability to handle nuclear technology.\nOver 23 years ago, a cobalt-60 cylinder used for radiology treatment went missing from a warehouse in Bangkok and ended up in the hands of a refuse scavenger, who sold it to a scrap dealer, who in turn broke the highly radioactive tube into various pieces to be resold. The outcome was tragic, as 1,872 people living around the scrapyard were found to have been exposed to harmful levels of radiation. Three people -- two scrapyard workers and the scrapyard owner's husband -- died two months later from radiation sickness.\nIn March last year, a tube containing radioactive Caesium-137 went missing from the National Power Plant 5A Company's facility in Prachin Buri province before later being found, burned, in a scrap metal factory.\nHowever, while the environmental impact, local community feedback and the as-yet-unproven financial viability of SMR technology must be considered, the main challenge is Thai authorities' poor record with radioactive waste management and transparency in general.\nWithout a significant turnaround in public opinion, the government's nuclear aspirations will likely remain just another pipe dream.\nEditorial\nBangkok Post editorial column\nThese&nbsp;editorials represent Bangkok Post&nbsp;thoughts about current issues and situations.\nEmail :\nanchaleek@bangkokpost.co.th\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat factor most influences your decision to choose a hotel or resort?\nPrice and discounts\nHotel reviews and ratings\nProximity to attractions\nHotel loyalty programs (e.g., points, rewards)\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nNuclear\nThailand\nDo you like the content of this article?\n56\n10\nCOMMENT\n(13)",

However, these challenges should not deter the nation from its path towards an electric future.\nIt is widely accepted that the future of automobiles is electric. Industry giants, including Goldman Sachs, predict that EVs could make up nearly half of global car sales by 2035.\nDespite this optimistic outlook, recent trends indicate a temporary slowdown in the international market.\nADVERTISEMENT\nEV sales in Europe dropped by 11% year-on-year in March, according to Bloomberg. In the United States, EV sales in the first quarter remained flat, as some automakers adjusted their EV strategies or laid off personnel.\nRELATED\nthailand\nInvest, Insure and Innovate in Uncertain Times\nbusiness\nA heady 12 months\nAnalysts, however, believe this decline could be temporary, merely a \"blip\" as the market anticipates the next growth impetus.\nIn Thailand, local operators remain optimistic about the growth prospects of the Thai EV market. Government policies offering various incentives to stimulate domestic demand for EVs and attract automakers to open production lines here have been effective.\nLast year, domestic sales of EVs skyrocketed by 603% year-on-year to more than 73,000 units. The Federation of Thai Industries is confident this growth will continue, if not strengthen, in the coming year.\nWith the domestic market growing steadily, one major part of Thailand's dream to become the regional hub of EVs is being fulfilled.\nFor the other part, manufacturing, the government has set a goal for zero-emission vehicles to comprise 30% of total car manufacturing by 2030.\nThailand can capitalise on its well-established supply-chain networks, logistics and skill base developed from being one of the world's manufacturing bases for internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles. This production goal is thus seen as attainable.\nAccording to the Board of Investment, auto giants including Toyota Motor Corp of Japan, as well as Great Wall Motor and SAIC Motor of China, have signed up for a government incentive plan to promote EV sales and production in Thailand.\nThai entrepreneurs are already building electric buses, boats and tuk-tuks while developing a vast network of charging stations.\nConcerns about climate change and CO2 emission standards make the case for EVs and zero-emission vehicles even stronger.\nThe electric transformation, with its far-reaching sweep and rapid pace, demands vast changes not just to the auto-making industry but also the infrastructure and environment that has supported fuel-burning automobiles for more than a century.\nThere is no question that every player -- the government, businesses and consumers looking for new opportunities amid the transition -- must quickly adapt to the changing environment.\nThe price cuts and insurance business uncertainty reflect the nature of this new industry driven by fast-paced technology.\nWhile regulators must ensure that legal frameworks are adequate and stringent to guard consumers against unfair practices, business operators would do well to anticipate the impacts from the change and develop measures to maintain customer confidence.\nIndustry leaders may have differing opinions on whether these difficulties, including reluctance by banks to provide auto loans, will slow down the EV acceleration. However, they should all agree that these issues should not cause anyone to lose sight of the future.\nAs electrification gains speed, the industry faces not just immediate adaptations to price fluctuations or the possible demise of the secondary market for used cars but also larger, fundamental questions.\nThese include ensuring an adequate clean power grid, balancing vehicle sales growth with creating infrastructure particularly charging stations, battery recycling capacity and future road construction that may need to accommodate self-driving vehicles or be embedded with charging mechanisms allowing EVs to recharge on the move.\nPhasing out the ICE production and people employed in the sector must also be done carefully to minimise disruptions.\nIndeed, the nature of EVs, which can become obsolete and lose value in the second-hand market, may disrupt the current sales model altogether, with renting becoming a preference and personal car insurance potentially becoming unnecessary. But these can present opportunities for discerning entrepreneurs to invent new businesses such as ride-sharing, EV repair or modifying centres.\nThailand's journey towards becoming a regional EV hub is just beginning, and while the road may be fraught with challenges, the destination promises a cleaner, more sustainable future for all.\nEditorial\nBangkok Post editorial column\nThese&nbsp;editorials represent Bangkok Post&nbsp;thoughts about current issues and situations.\nEmail :\nanchaleek@bangkokpost.co.th\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat is your budget range for purchasing a condominium?\nUnder 2 million THB\n2 million - 4 million THB\n4 million - 7 million THB\n7 million - 10 million THB\nOver 10 million THB\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nDo you like the content of this article?\n10\n33\nCOMMENT\n(21)",

Along with the likes of Japanese stars Shigeki Maruyama and Hideki Matsuyama, Chinese Taipei's CT Pan and Carl Yuan of China, Asia's glory-hunters understood the necessity of going toe-to-toe with the best, while pushing their own limits and boundaries.\nADVERTISEMENT\nNow, Tom Kim, a 22-year-old rising star, is embarking on a slightly different pathway in his dream to become the world's best golfer, and it is thanks to a growing bromance with World No.1 Scottie Scheffler.\nNot only is Kim battling week in, week out on the toughest professional golf circuit, he practises regularly with Scheffler, gets to pick the brain of the current dominant golfer and hangs out with the likeable American as they live four minutes apart in Dallas.\nThey also share the same birthdate of June 21 -- Kim turned 22 while Scheffler celebrated his 28th birthday last month -- and hold the same Christian faith which have forged their friendship. Scheffler's wife Meredith is also teaching their new-born son to address Kim as \"Uncle Tom\".\n\"It's been big. He's a really good friend,\" said Kim, who is already a three-time PGA Tour winner. \"I've learned a lot from him, obviously not just by watching him but by asking him a lot of things and he's been so kind to be able to share some stuff. Being as good as he is, I always want to pick his brain. I talk to him a lot about the mental aspects, about how he approaches the game more than the skill aspect. I've gotten to like Scottie more as a person than a golfer. He's one of the few people that when we're at home, we still hang out and play a lot of golf together.\"\nThe friendship began to flourish at The Open Championship last summer when Kim approached Scheffler for a practice round at Royal Liverpool. While the American has proven to be ruthless on the golf course -- he has already won six times this year -- he is as nice a person as it gets and offers Kim valuable nuggets of golf information.\n\"We were not as close as we are now and I went up to him and asked, hey, you want to play a practice round and we were a twosome for 18 holes. Things like that, he's such a humble human being,\" said Kim.\n\"I've asked him a million questions and he's given me a million answers. One of the best advice is you have to be able to kind of go through your processes and trust what you're doing. You want to contend, and I'm a very big competitor where I want to do those things, and for him to tell anybody, like just trust your process, do what you need to do, take care of what you need to do, those things have been a help for me.\"\nThis week, Kim returns to the Genesis Scottish Open, a joint sanctioned event by the PGA Tour and DP World Tour, where a solo third finish at the Renaissance Club two years ago signalled his arrival on the big stage. He was tied sixth last year and went on to finish runner-up in The Open for his best major finish to date, despite playing with torn ligaments in his ankle.\nMany believe it would be a matter of time before Kim challenges Scheffler for the World No.1 position. The young Korean had his first opportunity to go head-to-head with his good friend at the Travelers Championship recently where he forced a play-off with a gutsy 72nd hole birdie before losing on the first extra hole. Kim, who led the first three rounds at Travelers, said: \"After he tapped out, he said some really nice words and it meant a lot to me.\"\nScheffler treats Kim like his little brother, and often gives him a hard time as how siblings would. He genuinely believes Kim will be successful on Tour for a long time. \"He's a great player and a great champion. I think of a guy that young already winning three times out here and being the way that he is in the Presidents Cup. He's got the right attitude to play out here for a long time.\"\nNote: The writer is senior director, marketing &amp; communications -- APAC for the PGA TOUR.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat factor most influences your decision to choose a hotel or resort?\nPrice and discounts\nHotel reviews and ratings\nProximity to attractions\nHotel loyalty programs (e.g., points, rewards)\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nDo you like the content of this article?\n2\n1\nCOMMENT",

The perfect day for golden retrievers -- Bree and Bond -- to tie the knot in front of their closest human and canine friends.\nPet weddings are on the rise in China, where government policies have had little success in encouraging more humans to wed in this fast-ageing society where the population is declining and marriage and birth rates remain low.\nThe popularity of pets and an increasing willingness to splurge on them are driving the trend. Spending on furry companions in 2023 rose 3.2% to US$38.41 billion from a year earlier, industry figures have revealed.\nADVERTISEMENT\n\"People have weddings. Why can't dogs have weddings?\" Bree's owner Rye Ling said after escorting his female pet down the aisle, where she exchanged vows promising to always share treats and play with her husband Bond.\nAs of 2023, there were more than 116 million cats and dogs in urban China, according to figures by research firm Acuity Knowledge Partners. If distributed evenly across China's urban population, roughly one in eight Chinese people own a cat or a dog, with a majority of owners under 40, according to the research firm.\nRELATED\nLing and his girlfriend Gigi Chen, who said they're in no rush to get married themselves, meticulously planned the canine ceremony for months, arranging professional photographers, designing wedding booklets and ordering a custom-made, 800-yuan cake complete with toppers that resemble Bree and Bond. Yang Tao, whose Shanghai-based pet bakery prepared the cake, said she was initially surprised that customers wanted wedding cakes for their dogs.\n\"I think there will be more and more dog weddings,\" Yang said, adding that she has already catered several similar ceremonies since her bakery was launched in 2022.\n\"We have already received an order for a few months from now... and that's for a dog wedding.\"\nLing said he hoped the ceremony would give Bree and Bond a \"sense of ritual\".

Current growth in the service sector, largely due to foreign tourist spending, is helping to keep the economy afloat.\u2009(Photo: Pattarapong Chatpattarasill)\nAt the time of writing this, the official Q1 GDP has not been announced by the National Economic and Social Development Council (NESDC). I expect the growth figure will be around 1.2%. My own estimation, using the Output Approach and actual sectoral production index, gives a growth figure of 0.98%. Detailed data are in the below table.\nReaders might raise an eyebrow as to why I said NESDC's figure is likely 1.2% while my own estimation is 0.98%. The answer is this is Thailand, and a growth figure below 1.0% is not politically acceptable.\nThe GDP estimation of 0.98% is by no means pessimistic, but it is technically accurate. I test this method against actual 2023 GDP growth. The NESDC's growth figure is 1.90%, and this \"output\" method of estimation yields the result of 1.898%. If NESDC decides to announce Q1/2024 growth significantly higher than 1.2%, the agency will have a lot to explain to the public.\nADVERTISEMENT\nLow GDP growth for Q1/2024 is a result of contractions in output of both the agricultural and manufacturing sectors. Relatively high growth from the service sector, largely owing to foreign tourist spending, is saving the economy. Without a high level of service sector activities, Q1/2024 GDP growth would be in negative territory.\nRELATED\nopinion\nStimulus packages need paradigm shift\nopinion\nBoT ought to revise exchange rate policy\nWeak Q1 growth figures mean that 2.4%-2.8% growth projections for 2024 by all research houses are no longer realistic. It is likely the Q2 growth figure is lower than Q1 due to extreme heat and worsening NPLs. Thus, I remain firm in my original projection of -1.5% to 1.5% growth for 2024, with the base case of 0.0%.\nTo me, the stories behind these numbers are more interesting than the numbers themselves. There are four stories that can be derived from the weak Q1 data. First, consumption is losing steam (fast). Second, the financial sector is dying. Third, the manufacturing sector is losing competitiveness. Fourth, foreign tourists are spending much less.\nThe first story about consumption is the most important one. The Thai economy has been relying on private consumption to support growth for two decades. The reason why the economy is persistently weaker than our Asean peers is Thailand is a consumption-led economy, not a production-led economy. Two decades ago, household debt to GDP was at the appropriate level of 42.2%. Thai household debt now ranks in the top 10 of the world with 91.3% of GDP. The ratio over 60% of GDP is considered unsustainable for developing economies.\nWithout a private consumption push, GDP growth rates for 2022 and 2023 would be 0.8% and -0.5%, respectively. The core of the Thai economy is weak. So, when consumption starts to wind down, the economy shows its weakness like in Q1/2024. The causes of the winding down are not difficult to guess. Household debts hit the limit, and NPL levels threaten the banking sector's stability.\nConsumption that required financing contracted sharply in Q1/2024. Semi-durable goods consumption dropped 1.9%, and, hold your breath, durable goods consumption shrunk by 9.7%. Consumption of non-durable goods still grew healthily at 4.2%. Negative growth in durable goods consumption caused the Personal Consumption Index (PCI) to expand by only 0.8% in Q1/2024 compared to an expansion of 6.7% in 2023.\nWill the 500 billion baht cash handout scheme help? It surely would. But the government must first find money for the scheme. As of March 2024, the entire banking system has 25.2 trillion baht in deposits and 30.5 trillion baht in loans. There is already a cash shortage of 5.3 trillion baht in the banking system. The government has to be innovative in finding the 500 billion baht of cash.\nThe second story is \"No credit, no consumption\". The Thai banking sector is not functioning and generated only 1.2% credit growth in Q1/2024, which is only half the growth generated in the previous quarter. The reasons are (1) liquidity shortage, which was just explained, and (2) a horrifying NPL level.\nDo not be misled by the Bank of Thailand's report of NPL outstanding of 2.7% for household debt. If that is the actual figure, banks would still pump out more loans, even if that means borrowing more from foreign sources. Banks, as business entities, aim to maximise profits and will do anything that makes money. The real NPL figure of household debt is probably close to 20% and it is too risky to generate more credit.\nThe third story is the saddest one for me -- the dwindling manufacturing sector. The Manufacturing Production Index (MPI) contracted 3.7% in Q1/2024, a deeper contraction than the 2.9% decline in Q4/2023. This is an area of serious concern. No economy can be sustained without a strong production sector.\nThe dwindling manufacturing sector is not a result of soft domestic demand, as most economists see, but it is a competitiveness issue. Consumption robustly expanded at 6.2% and 7.1% in 2022 and 2023, respectively. Competitiveness deterioration is a direct result of an extended period of low investment to improve production efficiency. A part of the fault lies in the manufacturing sector itself. The sector failed to adapt to the rapidly changing world of competition.\nAnother part of the fault lies in the Thai banking system, which favoured consumption loans over business loans. At this point in time, the manufacturing sector is too outdated to be competitive. The situation is worse when China floods world markets with cheap exports. By the way, I read in the news that China, because of its soft economy, is buying less from the world and focusing on local supply chains. No wonder Thai exports (in value) declined by 10.2% in March 2024.\nIt seems Thailand is facing multiple incidences of bad luck as our brightest hope is growing dim. The tourism sector, which contributed 12% of GDP in 2019, is bound to contribute much less in 2024 and beyond. Foreign tourists still visit, albeit at somewhat lower numbers than in pre-Covid times, but they are spending much less. Before Covid, spending per tourist was about 45,000 baht. Now, they are spending 31,000 baht on average, which is 30% less. Service sector growth, which includes foreign tourist spending, declined to 7.4% in Q1/2024 from 17.7% growth in 2023. Growth for March 2024 is only 5.9%.\nI want to add that the Bank of Thailand quietly helps the export and tourism sectors by intentionally depreciating the Thai baht. Since the end of 2023, the baht, measuring in NEER terms, has depreciated 2.8% against our trading partner's currencies. Even with the help of currency value, the Thai economy is still weak.\nThe Thai economy, as evidenced by first quarter performance, is in one of the most difficult periods, and the country needs professional management, not dramas and dream projects.\nIn my next article, with my limited capability as a retired economist, I will demonstrate some solutions for the economy. My solutions cannot solve all the problems, but I hope to relieve economic pain for the majority of the people of Thailand.\nChartchai Parasuk\nFreelance economist\nChartchai Parasuk, PhD, is a freelance economist.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat factor most influences your decision to choose a hotel or resort?\nPrice and discounts\nHotel reviews and ratings\nProximity to attractions\nHotel loyalty programs (e.g., points, rewards)\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nChartchai Parasuk\nECONOMY TALK\nDo you like the content of this article?\n209\n1\nCOMMENT\n(17)",

Nurse Prabha is troubled when she receives an unexpected gift from her estranged husband who lives in Germany, while her younger roommate Anu searches in vain for a spot in a sweaty, congested city to share a moment with her boyfriend. This Indian film is directed by Payal Kapadia, one of the most exciting young filmmakers to emerge from the country. Her acclaimed first film from 2021, A Night Of Knowing Nothing, blends documentary with dreams and diary as it captures a student protest against right-wing nationalism gripping the country. All We Imagine As Light is Kapadia's first narrative film and already a triumph for having been selected in the coveted Cannes competition.\nADVERTISEMENT\nMongrel, a Taiwanese film starring Thai actor Wanlop Rungkumjad. (Photo \u00a9\nimdb.com\n)\nRELATED\nthailand\nChompoo Araya captivates at Cannes\nthailand\n30th EU Film Festival Celebrates European Diversity\nMongrel\nDirected by Chiang Wei Liang and  You Qiao Lin\nIn this gut-wrenching drama, an illegal Thai migrant worker in rural Taiwan is entrusted with the job of caring for a mentally handicapped man while struggling to stay afloat in the grey zone of the labour market. Wanlop Rungkumjad, a charismatic, talented actor who has appeared in several Thai independent films in the past 10 years, is the sole Thai presence in Cannes 2024 in this Taiwanese film directed by Chiang Wei Liang and You Qiao Lin. Mongrel is a hard-hitting social and moral drama that probes the lives of Thai, Filipino and Myanmar workers in Taiwan. It's showing in the Directors' Fortnight section (one of the sidebar programmes dedicated to edgy, ambitious filmmakers). You can look forward to it being shown in Thailand in one of the film festivals in the coming months.\nGrand Tour.\nGrand Tour\nDirected by Miguel Gomes\nWith its first poster featuring writing in Vietnamese, Myanmar, Bahasa, Japanese and Thai, Portuguese filmmaker Miguel Gomes cheekily pays tribute to the region where he sets his latest film. Set in 1917, Grand Tour follows a young British woman who sets out for Southeast Asia, embarking on a grand tour of tropical yearning and colonial melancholy. The still images evoke the time of George Orwell and Somerset Maugham. But since this is coming from Gomes, expect a paradise lost rather than claimed. The film was partially shot in Thailand.\nViet And Nam.\nViet And Nam\nDirected by Truong Min Quy\nThis drama confirms Vietnam's rising reputation in the international festival circuit, following Inside The Yellow Cocoon Shell winning the Camera d'Or at Cannes in 2023. Shot on grainy 16mm, Viet And Nam follows two young miners (aptly called Nam and Viet) as they set out to locate the remains of Nam's father in a remote forest -- and thus the history of the nation is merged with modern sensibility and perhaps confusion. Expect the film to gain more publicity in the coming months, and it seems likely that audiences in Thailand will have a chance to see it soon.\nMegalopolis\nDirected by Francis Ford Coppola\nThis is definitely going to be the hottest ticket in Cannes this year. Francis Ford Coppola sold his Californian wine estate to finance Megalopolis, ensuring complete control of the project long gestated, rumoured, shot and now finally ready for either adulation or axes in Cannes. Adam Driver plays a visionary architect who strives to rebuild New York after a mega-disaster, that much is known about the story. Coppola cites H.G. Wells as one of his inspirations, and in the film's one-minute teaser we see Driver commanding time to stop as he's perched atop a Manhattan skyscraper. This is Coppola's first return to the Cannes Competition 45 years after Apocalypse Now won the Palme d'Or.\nCaught By The Tides\nDirected by Jia Zhang-ke\nJia Zhang-ke returns to the Cannes Competition with Caught By The Tides, a story of a couple spanning 20 years. A steadfast chronicler of modern China, in which individual aspirations often clash with the collective desire for progress, Jia assembles this film from new materials and footage that go back to 2001, mixing 16mm images with digital and AI image creators (now that's the word we're waiting to hear). The film stars his wife and frequent contributor Zhao Tao.\nShe's Got No Name.\nShe's Got No Name\nDirected by Peter Ho-Sun Chan\nZhang Zhiyi stars in this historical movie from China-based Hong Kong director Peter Chan (a frequent visitor to Thailand and a good friend to the Thai filmmaking community). She's Got No Name, showing out of competition, arrives in Cannes with the distinction of being the biggest Chinese production of the year, narrating a story of women's social rights through the struggle of a character whose suffering triggers a social movement. Chan is known for making solid, heartfelt entertainment with strong subtexts. It's reported that the shooting of this film required blocks of streets in Shanghai to be closed for months. We can also look forward to seeing Zhang Zhiyi on the red carpet after so many years, too.\nRendez-Vous Avec Pol Pot\nDirected by Rithy Panh\nFrom the Paris-based Cambodian director, Rendez-Vous Avec Pol Pot continues Rithy Panh's lifelong storytelling of the horror of the Khmer Rouge years. Here's a synopsis of the film: \"Democratic Kampuchea (Cambodia, 1978). Three French journalists are invited by the Khmer Rouge to conduct an exclusive interview of the regime's leader, Pol Pot. But the regime is declining and war threatens the country. Under the eyes of the journalists, the beautiful picture reveals the horror and their journey progressively turns into a nightmare.\" French actress Irene Jacob plays one of the reporters.\nManthan\nDirected by Shyam Benegal\nThis 1976 film, whose restored print will be shown in the indispensable Cannes Classics, was financed by the donations of 500,000 Indian farmers and thus holds the distinction of being the first crowdfunded production in India. A fictionalised account of a real event, the film tells the story of a veterinarian who arrives in a poor rural village to start a milk co-operative, with the hope of improving the livelihoods of struggling dairy farmers. Manthan was India's submission to the Oscars in 1977.\nLa Belle De Gaza\nDirected by Yolande Zauberman\nThis is as close as Cannes gets this year to addressing the word Gaza in its programme. The documentary film La Belle De Gaza is the work of Yolande Zauberman, and it follows the ordeal of a transsexual person from Gaza who seeks her future in Tel Aviv. It sounds like something that pushes all the hot buttons at the moment. We may expect real and symbolic protests in and around the glitzy festival in the next 10 days, but the politics of the Middle East seems to take a low profile here.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat hotel facilities are most important to you when choosing accommodation?\nSwimming pool\nFitness center\nRestaurants and bars\nMassage and spa\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nCannes 2024\nDo you like the content of this article?\n4\n4\nCOMMENT",

These statues bear witness to the ravages of time and conflict. Each one appears disfigured, mismatched, and forlorn, some lacking heads, others missing arms or bodies, while still others feature smaller bodies pieced together from fragments of other shattered statues. They serve as a powerful inspiration for Manit as their erosion is analogous to the erosion of moral values in contemporary society, particularly within the social justice system. Thailand's political landscape has been marred by nearly two decades of ongoing conflict, where the pursuit of power leaves behind a society teetering on the brink of irreparability. Manit channels these themes of violence and despair onto his canvases, juxtaposing the image of broken Buddha statues with the raw emotions of a society in turmoil.&nbsp;\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nHow much do hotel reviews (e.g., TripAdvisor, Google Reviews) influence your accommodation choice?\nVery important, I always check reviews before booking\nSomewhat important, I check reviews if I\u2019m unsure\nNeutral, I don\u2019t pay much attention to reviews\nNot important at all, I don\u2019t check reviews\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nDo you like the content of this article?\n1\n0\nCOMMENT",

Singaporeans enjoy some of the highest living standards in Asia but it is also one of the most stressed-out societies.\u2009Bloomberg\nThe search for success can be elusive, and possibly nowhere more so than in Singapore, one of the most competitive and overworked places on the planet. Long hours are the norm, a reputation it has built since the island-state gained independence from Malaysia almost 60 years ago and had to carve an identity for itself in an uncertain and scary world.\nToday, Singaporeans enjoy some of the highest living standards in Asia. But all of this has come at a price. It is also one of the most stressed-out societies. There is a silent epidemic of depression and mental health hiding just under the surface as citizens struggle to balance work, life, family, and their own private aspirations and dreams. Making it can mean huge personal sacrifices.\nSome have decided to opt out all together. Ashish Xiangyi Kumar is a 31-year-old retiree. He has a LinkedIn page that is a little different from most of his peers. Under his name and above the prestigious University of Cambridge mention it says, \"Happily Free\".\nADVERTISEMENT\nHe is also a Singaporean success story: Its top Indian student in 2004, and one of the highest scorers in primary school leaving examinations. He studied at one of the most prestigious schools, winning a government scholarship to Cambridge, where he graduated second in his class with a law degree. He came back to Singapore to work in a prized government job, allowing him to earn a decent salary at a very young age. But he told Rice Media accomplishment to him is about more than just good grades, or the right job, or the amount in his bank.\nHis decision to retire at such a young age has prompted scores of Singaporeans to marvel at the path he has taken. Especially as the government has been raising the official retirement age every year. From 2026, employees can only be asked to retire when they turn 64, all part of a move to progressively increase the retirement age to 65 by 2030.\n\"Burnout culture is really strong in Singapore,\" Hykel Quek, a senior writer at Rice Media who interviewed Mr Kumar, told me. \"People have been really supportive of what he is doing, but he also acknowledges that he is privileged. He received a government scholarship, has no debt or liabilities, and he's not interested in a romantic relationship or having kids. So this life works for him.\"\nIt's not a life that can work for the majority of us. Recent studies show that burnout culture in the city-state is at an all-time high, and much of that is due to the competitive work environment. There is also the stigma of seeking help for mental issues, which adds to the burden of depression and anxiety. Much of this begins from an early age, with expectations of having to outperform at school. Parents often add to the pressure from the education system by giving children tuition classes to increase their chances of getting into a good secondary school and university. It is a weight that continues through their lives, the demands of a society that typically has never rewarded the path less trodden.\nWhich is why Mr Kumar's story stands out. But the nomadic life he's chosen -- filled with writing, reading, long-distance hiking, and classical music -- is also unrealistic to try and emulate.\nSingapore is not unusual in pressure-cooker Asian societies. South Korea and Japan have comparable rates of stress. The Singapore Dream, though, is heavily prescriptive -- anyone choosing a different route is seen as a bit of an anomaly.\nThe vast majority of Singaporeans get married in their twenties so they can apply for government-subsidised housing, then go on to attempt to have the recommended number of kids, buy a car for a small fortune, and reap the rewards of a conventionally successful life. Except that these days, fewer and fewer are choosing to have children because of how expensive they've become and how stressful it is. As people hit the middle years, they begin to wonder what it's all for. This is often when the dreaded midlife crisis hits, compounded by the feeling of purposelessness, and being stuck in their lives: Looking after young children and ageing parents while trying to strike a balance between work, family, and personal care.\nIt is an experience I have seen firsthand, juggling an ageing and unwell parent with the demands of raising children in a highly demanding society. The city-state is facing a silent epidemic that needs to be addressed, but many are also reluctant to speak up about their mental health issues because of the stigma around getting treatment. Admitting you need help is considered a weakness in many Asian cultures, and Singapore is no different, although thankfully, this is changing among the younger generations.\nThe government is trying to improve things by introducing more flexible work and encouraging employers to provide help for those who need it. Talking about mental health and the pressures of working life more openly would help. An acknowledgment that the route to success doesn't have to be linear, and is paved with mistakes, would also aid in changing expectations of what success looks like. Mr Kumar is an outlier -- but his story is one of hope and the path less travelled. More Singaporeans may be tempted to consider it.\u2009\u00a92024 Bloomberg\nKarishma Vaswani is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering Asia politics with a special focus on China.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nIf you were to buy real estate in Thailand outside of Bangkok, which area would be your top choice?\nChiang Mai\nPhuket\nPattaya\nKhao Yai\nKoh Samui\nHua Hin\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nDo you like the content of this article?\n13\n1\nCOMMENT\n(2)",

The small size makes them easy to build, transport and install.\nThailand\u2019s nuclear ambitions\nADVERTISEMENT\nThailand was the pioneer in Southeast Asia for nuclear research. The country launched its first nuclear reactor in 1962, albeit for research purposes. In the early 1970s, the government launched a plan to build the first nuclear power plant in Chon Buri province. The initiative did not take off, however, because of the high cost, time-consuming construction and the fear of a nuclear accident.\nRELATED\nthailand\nThai foreign minister visiting South Australia\nopinion\nNuclear fears justified\nTwo decades ago, policymakers at the Ministry of Energy tried to revive the nuclear energy plan. But the dream was curtailed by a tsunami-driven accident that damaged a nuclear power plant in Fukushima, Japan, in 2011.\nThe advancement of SMR technology has revived Bangkok\u2019s interest in nuclear energy. SMRs, while generating less power than standard reactors, are considered safer. Several countries, including the US, UK and China, are making significant progress in advancing SMR technology.\nThe dream drew closer in November 2022 when the US reportedly pledged technical support for SMRs to the Thai government under the leadership of then-prime minister Prayut Chan-o-cha.\nThe current leader, PM Srettha Thavisin, mentioned that he discussed the possibility of introducing nuclear power with US Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo during their meeting in Bangkok on March 14.\nMr Srettha also stated that Thailand would assess the safety of SMRs and seek public opinion.\nEconomic viability\nNuclear energy is often seen as a clean energy source because it generates almost no carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases.\nIt is also considered more reliable for supplying consistent electricity compared to renewable sources like solar and wind.\nHowever, challenges persist in managing spent fuel from reactors. So far, there is no risk-free disposal method.\nNuclear energy is used in 32 countries globally, accounting for roughly 10% of the world\u2019s total electricity capacity.\nLeading users of nuclear power include the United States, France and China.\nMeanwhile, nations such as Bangladesh, Egypt and Turkey are in the process of adopting nuclear power. Worldwide, there are over 400 active nuclear power plants, with more than 50 currently being built.\nBarriers to entry\nThe key barrier to implementing nuclear power plants in Thailand is not the technological limitations but rather commercial feasibility.\nDespite its potential, the Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE) for nuclear power plants is still higher than those of other renewable energy sources.\nThe LCOE is the average cost of a reactor during its lifespan, including construction, fuel as well as operation and maintenance costs.\nThe current cost of generating electricity from nuclear power is US$180 (6,664 baht) per megawatt-hour, which is higher than the cost of electricity from popular fossil fuels like natural gas and coal, as well as from renewable energy sources.\nNuclear energy is 2.5 to 3 times more expensive than solar and wind power.\nEnergy grid and nuclear energy?\nThailand is not lacking in terms of its electricity supply. The country\u2019s power generation capacity exceeded demand by 34 percent in 2022, with a total capacity of 49,099 megawatts, higher than the peak demand of 32,250MW.\nThe surplus comes from the over-projection of energy demand by policymakers. The surplus is transferred to consumers. The cost of surplus electricity is factored into the FT (fuel transfer) in monthly utility bills.\nIntroducing nuclear power into the grid could increase costs further. As nuclear comes with higher overheads, the government should use other renewable energy forms like solar energy \u2014 something that can be produced locally.\nGreenpeace states that Thailand has the capacity for more than 35,000MW of renewable energy, based on their research. However, the government is only buying 100MW a year, which falls short of this potential.\nThai policymakers can emulate Vietnam. According to the Ember Global Electricity Review, Vietnam is acting aggressively in adopting solar and wind energy while also trying to reduce its dependence on fossil fuel. In 2021, solar power generation increased by 337%, leading to more reductions in coal and gas use.\nThe International Renewable Energy Agency (Irena) notes that renewable energy projects launched in emerging economies in 2020 could save up to $156 billion throughout their lifetimes. This highlights the importance of accelerating renewable adoption as a cost-effective route to decarbonising power systems.\nLooking ahead, the cost of solar and wind energy is expected to continue declining due to ongoing research and development. In contrast, nuclear power, except for nuclear fusion, may lack such support, making it an unlikely alternative energy option in Thailand due to the higher costs.\nKongpob Areerat is a communications manager and researcher at Climate Finance Network Thailand (CFNT), a think tank devoted to propelling sustainable financial practices and assisting in Thailand\u2019s transition towards a low-carbon economy.

I think the DP World Tour Top-10 to the PGA Tour is a great incentive.\"\nRELATED\nsports\nPeter Perfect! Uihlein tops with victory\nsports\nThere's plenty for Thai star Jeeno to smile about\nGolf's international eco-system has already begun to reap the \"play better\" mantra, which reinforces the ideals of the PGA Tour and DP World Tour to safeguard the concept of meritocracy in the sport. Essentially, if you become the top player at home, you get promoted to the DP World Tour, which has 44 events across the globe and approximately US$150 million in prize funds. Finish top-10 there, and the PGA Tour awaits.\nThis week's ISPS Handa Championship in Gotemba, Japan, with Mount Fuji as the backdrop, will see former world amateur No.1, Keita Nakajima looking to scale new heights following a wire-to-wire four-stroke victory in the Hero Indian Open last month. Thailand's Kiradech Aphibarnrat is also in the field.\nNaturally, Nakajima has set his sights on the PGA Tour after he joined fellow countryman Rikuya Hoshino as a winner this season on the DP World Tour, formerly the European Tour. Hoshino was victorious in Qatar in February and two other runner-up finishes have lifted him up to second place on the DP World Tour rankings.\nThe 23-year-old Nakajima believes the new pathways are pushing aspiring golfers to aim for the stars. \"I'm very grateful to the JGTO and DP World Tour,\" said Nakajima, who was Japan's No.1 last season and is presently 15th in the Race to Dubai rankings. \"Knowing that placing first on the [JGTO] money list will get you a DP World Tour card is added motivation to play better. Many Japanese players will look to compete here as a way to make it onto the PGA Tour. I hope I can continue to play well and make my way to the PGA Tour, and become an example to other Japanese players who have the same aspirations.\"\nFor others like Thailand's Kiradech Aphibarnrat, who lost his PGA Tour playing rights in 2022 after spending four seasons in the US, a return to the DP World Tour has allowed him to find his feet again after landing in more rough than fairways in recent years. The Thai, who is in the field in Gotemba this week, returned to the spotlight with a runner-up finish in the Singapore Classic in February, and knows winning a fifth career title on the DP World Tour could well pave his way back to America.\n\"I will leave that to the future,\" the 34-year-old said about the prospects of getting back to the PGA Tour. \"I'm just going to try to win on the DP World Tour again. Winning is the goal this season. My ball striking was insane [in Singapore] and feels like I'm back to where it was. I know I've got something in me.\"\nWith the China Open featuring on the DP World Tour schedule next week following a four-year hiatus, the likes of Li Haotong and Wu Ashun will relish the opportunity to play on home turf. The 28-year-old Li, who is a three-time DP World Tour winner and China's first golfer to play in the Presidents Cup in 2019, has shown signs of a resurgence after a challenging past couple of years with indifferent form and numerous missed cuts that he cares to remember. He has never held a PGA Tour card, and it remains to be seen if he will fulfill his early promise which includes a memorable third-place finish at The Open Championship in 2017.\n\"So many people behind me, parents, friends, telling me how good I am, reminding me I can do this,\" said Li, whose biggest career title to date was the 2018 Dubai Desert Classic where he outduelled Rory McIlroy in a head-to-head showdown. \"I've been thinking that if I had worked this hard and still couldn't make anything I would find something else to do. But the results tell me I can keep going.\"\nNote: The writer is senior director, marketing and communications -- APAC for the PGA Tour and is based in Malaysia.

The stellar stock market performance happened amid the fact that Japan's economy is officially in recession after two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth.\nIf negative economic growth is not scary enough, Japan's 2023 inflation is the worst in 41 years, with the yen depreciating beyond 150 yen to the dollar. Moreover, the Bank of Japan will likely raise interest rates soon, which would be the first time since 2016.\nDespite such negative economic news, the Japanese stock market has been sizzling. So why are investors optimistic about Japan's future? It's because Japan delivers results.\nADVERTISEMENT\nIt might not be just a coincidence that the day the Nikkei hit a record high was the same day that TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company) opened its first factory in the Japanese city of Kumamoto. Japan wants to reclaim its position as a world leading chipmaker. In 1989, NEC, Toshiba, and Hitachi supplied half of the world's DRAM chips, and now the Japanese government wants to restore its glory.\nRELATED\nbusiness\nPanel aims  to delay wage hike\nbusiness\nXi seizes role as global defender of free trade against Trump\nThe good news for high-tech Japan does not end at chipmaking. Amazon Web Services decided to invest 2.26 trillion yen (535 billion baht) in cloud infrastructure in Japan. This investment project is estimated will add an additional 5.57 trillion yen to Japan's GDP and generate 30,500 full-time jobs.\nGame-changing investment projects do not come cheaply. Obviously, the country must have the necessary infrastructure and human resources to support such operations. But incentives are also important. In the case of TSMC, Japan's government has vowed to provide 1.2 trillion yen to support the investment. And, probably because of smart generosity, a second TSMC factory is in discussion.\nIt is clear to me that investors are buying into Japan's glowing high-tech industry future and ignoring its unpleasant economic past.\nWhile the Nikkei index is blooming, Thai's SET index is wilting like a flower that has not been watered for years. The Thai index plummeted 16% within a year, and there is no telling when it will rise again. So why are investors pessimistic about Thailand's future? Because the country delivers nothing but empty promises. I will call them \"unachievable dreams\".\nThailand does not just have one dream like Japan -- we have eight dreams! They include being a (1) tourism hub, (2) wellness and medical hub, (3) agriculture and food hub, (4) aviation hub, (5) logistic hub, (6) future mobility hub, (7) digital economy hub, and (8) a financial hub. These eight ambitious hubs are announced under the \"Ignite Thailand\" strategy. But there is little indication of how Thailand can achieve any of these lofty goals. With an unfocused plan filled with empty promises, investors take their money to Japan's stock market.\nBefore any dreams of being whatever \"hub\", the government needs to quickly improve Thai education quality, which is now ranked at 56 out of 64 countries surveyed by the International Institute for Management Development (IMD). In the survey, Singapore ranked number seven and Malaysia 39. It is obvious that all hub dreams require high-quality human capital to make them come true. The quality of human capital is the very reason why NVIDIA, the world's third most valuable company, is investing $4.3 billion (153.6 billion baht) in an AI data centre in Malaysia, not in Thailand.\nThere are also a few interesting issues I would like to discuss. Given limited space, I can discuss only three: (1) a silly interest rate debate, (2) unworthy cash handout scheme, and (3) shocking energy price bombs.\nThe first issue is the interest reduction debate between the government and the Bank of Thailand. There is a civilised, scientific way to settle the argument. Exchanging nasty words will lead to nothing. Experienced economists know very well that the effects of an interest rate reduction differ from economy to economy.\nIt is empirically shown to stimulate consumption in the US and UK but shown to harm consumption in Japan. So why not stop exchanging words and simulating econometric models to see scientific results?\nThe Bank of Thailand, Fiscal Policy Office (Ministry of Finance), and National Economic and Social Development Council all possess sophisticated econometric models which they use regularly for economic projections.\nJust simply change the value of interest rate variable -- say lowering the rate by a quarter of percentage point, half a percentage point, and one full percentage point -- to see the reduction effects on GDP growth, inflation, and exchange rates. All three institutions could then sit down and professionally discuss the simulation results.\nIf the plus effects of interest reduction outweigh the minus effects, the Bank of Thailand should agree to make the cut with no mumbling about high levels of debt, capital outflow, and inflation. But if the results prove to be otherwise, the government should stop blaming the Bank of Thailand for not making the cut, but stand behind the Bank of Thailand's decision.\nThe next issue is the economic wonder of the 10,000 baht cash handout scheme. The scheme is most likely to be unworthy of taxpayer's money. A Bank of Thailand study concluded the fiscal multiplier of such a money transfer scheme is only 0.4. Therefore, the 500 billion baht spending (3% of GDP) would create only a 200 billion baht (1.2%) GDP increase. Where does the rest of the money (300 billion baht) go? It goes abroad.\nThailand's import value is equivalent to 68.1% of GDP as opposed to 25.4% of GDP in Japan and 14.3% of GDP in China. Our economy is highly dependent on foreign imports. Thais do not consume products that we produce, such as petrochemicals. We export them in exchange for consumable imports. If the government chooses to hand out 500 billion baht in cash, only 159.5 billion baht would be spent on domestically produced products in the first round.\nThe reduced effect of the cash handout programme is confirmed by the World Bank and the IMF.\nThe last issue is the energy price time bombs. In May, the nation might be shocked with a energy price hike. Current gasoline pump prices are heavily subsidised through the Thailand Oil Fund. As of March 3, the fund was 93.5 billion baht in red. I have heard that the fund's financial deficit is limited to 110 billion baht by law.\nIf that is the case, the fund could reach its deficit limit towards the end of April. By then, the government would have two choices: raising pump prices and/or reducing the gasoline excise tax, which would hurt government income. I believe it would be a combination of the two options.\nThe Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (Egat) is much in the same position as Thailand Oil Fund. They have been subsidising electricity rates in lieu of the government. The subsidy burden was 137 billion baht at the end of 2023. The amount could exceed 150 billion baht around about now. Therefore, a substantial electricity rate hike for May to August 2024 is inevitable.\nLastly, may I give advice to the government. Nobody believes in aspiring words any more. They demand action plans and results. When China sets a 5% growth target for 2024 without clear action plans, investors dump oil in fear of China's receding demand and buy gold for security.\nChartchai Parasuk\nFreelance economist\nChartchai Parasuk, PhD, is a freelance economist.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWould you consider buying a house in a gated community or as a standalone property?\nGated community\nStandalone house\nEither, depending on location and price\nNo preference\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nECONOMY TALK\nChartchai Parasuk\nDo you like the content of this article?\n122\n0\nCOMMENT\n(10)",

It is probably the nation's most important resource besides its people. And heritage empowers the people. It supports social and economic welfare in lots of ways. It's worth taking care of.\nUnfortunately, however, the nation's heritage conservation system is centred on a policy that is more than six decades old, from before the era of booming growth and urbanisation. It is not up to today's needs. The Act on Ancient Monuments, Antiques, Objects of Art and National Museums (1961) is a narrow law that limits protection to archaeological sites, artefacts and architecture that are very old -- usually more than 100 years.\nLots of valuable heritage is more recent. And all over Thailand, heritage is intertwined with everyday life and modern culture. Think of the old towns and shophouse neighbourhoods, waterfront communities, temples, street vending, fresh markets, vintage wooden houses, civic buildings, and industrial heritage like old train stations and warehouses.\nADVERTISEMENT\nDespite the high value of this heritage, most of it lacks any official protection or conservation funding. The agency in charge, the Ministry of Culture's Fine Arts Department, got only 2.2 billion baht in annual budget in 2023, yet it has many tasks besides conservation. It issues warnings to protect heritage assets, but other agencies often lack the capacity or will to act.\nBecause this system is outdated, Thailand is losing important heritage resources every year. At the same time, conservation of heritage ranks low on the national agenda.\nRELATED\nlife\nDjinn is a strong spirit\nlife\nDecoding the past\nAs in many countries, it's usually not a priority for the public, the civil service, or political leaders. That leaves powerful corporations, tourism operators and institutions free to seek short-term gains that erode heritage, creating long-term losses for society.\nIt doesn't have to be this way. The government should develop a new, more dynamic approach, adapting global models to Thailand's context to overhaul the nation's heritage policies, laws and regulations.\nUnder a long-term, comprehensive plan, heritage in every town and province should be surveyed and sustained with incentives, funding and local collaboration. Thailand should create its own institution like the National Trust of Korea, English Heritage Trust, or Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage.\nCompared to building a trillion-baht megaproject, investment in heritage assets would cost little. After all, heritage has already been built. Yet sustaining it would plant seeds of progress in every province. Examples in Thailand and around the world show that heritage contributes to education, cultural tourism, careers, community, sense of place and quality of life.\nCreative roots\nThe creative economy is a good example. Thai architects, designers, artists, curators, musicians, dancers, filmmakers and other creative professionals continually borrow from heritage resources, using it as capital to construct something new.\nMuseums, old buildings and history-rich places are powerful sources of inspiration. So are Thailand's traditional arts and crafts, music, dance, festivals, literature and local food. These cultural assets were created decades or centuries ago, yet they continue to create value.\nThis all comes alive at the Thailand Biennale, the international exhibition of contemporary art taking place in Chiang Rai province through April 30, sponsored by the Ministry of Culture's Office of Contemporary Art and Culture. Led by a dream team of veteran Thai curators, this event features heritage in a sensitive way that puts quality and culture first, rather than commerce and tourism.\nMany of the 60 artists from Thailand and 25 countries around the world created new works specific to Chiang Rai's context, working with local artisans, materials and stories. The art is spread out across the mountainous province in more than 20 sites that include museums, galleries, an old tobacco warehouse, a set of railway cars, a meditation centre, and an ancient stupa.\nCommunity groups exhibit hundreds more artists, with open-house visits to studios. There are workshops, outdoor film screenings, street food, activities for kids, and performances of music and dance. In the best Thai way, it's a festival.\nPower of diversity\nTo be clear, the Thailand Biennale is not a \"conservation\" project per se. It's experimental and temporary. It doesn't preserve threatened architecture, document oral histories, or research artefacts. This institutional kind of conservation is greatly needed in every province. But the event shows what Thailand's heritage has to offer. It celebrates the power of community, diversity, critical perspective, and respect for differing opinions.\nThis exploratory approach reflects the nature of \"contemporary\" art. These days, art is not so much about beautiful paintings and sculpture. Artists today want to open your senses and mind to all kinds of new experiences and insights on yourself and the world. At the Biennale, they work with heritage to create a kaleidoscope of fresh visions of the past.\nOne example is Displaced in Whose Land?, a documentary by Navin Rawanchaikul, an Indian-Thai artist from nearby Chiang Mai. In the film, he journeys around Chiang Rai's Chiang Saen district chatting amiably with local people. Sharing bowls of noodles cooked from family recipes, he learns their ancestral stories of migration.\nThe film reveals that some communities in there have as much in common with people in Myanmar, Laos and China as with those in Bangkok. After all, people have migrated to northern Thailand from up and down the Mekong River for millennia. The curators call it \"translocalism\" -- a fact of life in any border province. Navin also painted a huge, Bollywood-style movie billboard vignetting the film.\nAnother project, The 101 Historic Lanna House Collective, proves that Thailand's vintage wooden houses can still be saved. Artist Roongroj Paimyossak has spent years helping families preserve their homes rather than sell them off as scrap teakwood. His paintings convey the beauty of these structures.\nHilltribe people often feature in tourism campaigns and philanthropic projects, but at the Biennale, they speak for themselves. Busui Ajaw, a self-taught artist of Akha ethnicity, presents expressionistic paintings on animal skin depicting ancestral spirits. In April, the Biennale will host a festival of music by hilltribe groups. Other exhibits feature Muslim artists from Thailand's Deep South.\nInclusiveness is the Biennale's top priority, says Angrit Ajcharyasophon, a Chiang Rai artist who is one of the curators. Around the world, art biennales tend to be elite, metropolitan events that take place in big museums, glittering with billionaires, celebrities and superstar artists.\nLarge works of art are shipped in at great expense of cash and carbon.\nLocal first\nThe Thai team chose instead to invite most of the artists to create their works on site, collaborating with local potters, embroiderers, metalsmiths, carpenters and weavers.\nTaiwan's Wang Wen-Chi, for example, sourced 20,000 bamboo poles from Chiang Rai suppliers, working with local bamboo craftsmen to build a marvellous sculptural pavilion.

Defence Minister Boris Pistorius has begun warning Germans that they should prepare for decades of confrontation with Russia and that they must speedily rebuild the country's military in case Vladimir Putin does not plan to stop at the border with Ukraine. (Tyler Hicks/The New York Times)\nBERLIN: German Defence Minister Boris Pistorius has begun warning Germans that they should prepare for decades of confrontation with Russia \u2014 and that they must speedily rebuild the country\u2019s military in case Russian Vladimir Putin does not plan to stop at the border with Ukraine.\nRussia\u2019s military, he has said in a series of recent interviews with German news media, is fully occupied with Ukraine. But if there is a truce, and Putin has a few years to reset, he thinks the Russian leader will consider testing NATO\u2019s unity.\n\u201cNobody knows how or whether this will last,\u201d Pistorius said of the current war, arguing for a rapid build-up in the size of the German military and a restocking of its arsenal.\nADVERTISEMENT\nAds powered by\nPistorius\u2019 public warnings reflect a significant shift at the top levels of leadership in a country that has shunned a strong military since the end of the Cold War. The alarm is growing louder, but the German public remains unconvinced that the security of Germany and Europe has been fundamentally threatened by a newly aggressive Russia.\nRELATED\nworld\nHuge illegal drug lab exposed in Syria\nopinion\nDemocracy is in need of workers\nThe defence minister\u2019s post in Germany is often a political dead end. But Pistorius\u2019 status as one of the country\u2019s most popular politicians has given him a freedom to speak that others \u2014 including his boss, Chancellor Olaf Scholz \u2014 do not enjoy.\nAs Scholz prepares to meet President Joe Biden at the White House on Friday, many in the German government say that there is no going back to business as usual with Putin\u2019s Russia, that they anticipate little progress this year in Ukraine and that they fear the consequences should Putin prevail there.\nThose fears have now mixed with discussions about what will happen to NATO if former President Donald Trump is elected and has a second chance to act on his instinct to pull the United States out of the alliance.\nThe prospect of a re-elected Trump has German officials and many of their fellow NATO counterparts informally discussing whether the nearly 75-year-old alliance structure they are planning to celebrate in Washington this year can survive without the United States at its centre. Many German officials say Putin\u2019s best strategic hope is NATO\u2019s fracture.\nFor the Germans in particular, it is an astounding reversal of thinking. Only a year ago, NATO was celebrating a new sense of purpose and a new unity, and many were confidently predicting Putin was on the run.\nBut now, with an undependable America, an aggressive Russia and a striving China, as well as a seemingly stalemated war in Ukraine and a deeply unpopular conflict in the Gaza Strip, German officials are beginning to talk about the emergence of a new, complicated and troubling world, with severe consequences for European and trans-Atlantic security.\nTheir immediate concern is growing pessimism that the United States will continue to fund Ukraine\u2019s struggle, just as Germany, the second-largest contributor, has agreed to double its contribution this year, to about $8.5 billion.\nNow, some of Pistorius\u2019 colleagues are warning that if US funding dries up and Russia prevails, its next target will be closer to Berlin.\n\u201cIf Ukraine were forced to surrender, that would not satisfy Russia\u2019s hunger for power,\u201d Bruno Kahl, chief of Germany\u2019s intelligence service, said last week. \u201cIf the West does not demonstrate a clear readiness to defend, Putin will have no reason not to attack NATO anymore.\u201d\nBut when they are pressed about a possible conflict with Russia, or the future of NATO, German politicians speak carefully.\nIn the decades since the Soviet Union collapsed, most Germans have grown accustomed to the notions that the country\u2019s security would be assured if it worked with Russia, not against it, and that China is a necessary partner with a critical market for German automobiles and equipment.\nEven today, Scholz, a Social Democrat whose party traditionally sought decent ties with Russia, seems reluctant to discuss the far more confrontational future with Russia or China that German defence and intelligence chiefs describe so vividly.\nWith the exception of Pistorius, little known before he was picked to run the Defence Ministry a year ago, few politicians will take on the subject in public. Scholz is especially careful, tending to Germany\u2019s relationship with the United States and wary of pushing Russia and its unpredictable president too hard.\nTwo years ago, he declared a new era for Germany \u2014 a \u201cZeitenwende\u201d, or a historic turning point, in German security policy, one that he said would be marked by a significant shift in spending and strategic thinking. He made good on a promise to allocate an extra 100 billion euros (about $108 billion) for military spending over four years.\nThis year, for the first time, Germany will spend 2% of its gross domestic product on the military, reaching the goal that all NATO countries agreed to in 2014, after the Russian annexation of Crimea, but that most experts warn is now too low. And Germany has committed to beefing up NATO\u2019s eastern flank against Russia by promising to permanently station a brigade in Lithuania by 2027.\nYet, in other ways, Scholz has moved with great caution. He has opposed \u2014 along with Biden \u2014 setting a timetable for Ukraine\u2019s eventual entry into the alliance.\nThe most vivid example of his caution is his continued refusal to provide Ukraine a long-range, air-launched cruise missile called the Taurus.\nLast year, Britain and France gave Ukraine their closest equivalent, the Storm Shadow/SCALP, and it has been used to devastate Russian ships in Crimean ports \u2014 and to force Russia to pull back its fleet. Biden reluctantly agreed to provide ATACMS, a similar missile but with a range limited to about 100 miles, to Ukraine in the autumn.\nThe Taurus has a range of more than 500km, meaning Ukraine could use it to strike deep into Russia. And Scholz is not willing to take that chance \u2014 nor is the country\u2019s Bundestag, which voted against a resolution calling for the transfer. Although the decision seems to fit German opinion, Scholz wants to avoid the subject.\nBut if he remains reluctant to push Putin too hard, it is a caution Germans share.\nPolls show that Germans want to see a more capable German military. But only 38% of those surveyed said they wanted their country to be more involved in international crises, the lowest figure since that question began to be asked in 2017, according to the K\u00f6rber Foundation, which conducted the survey. Of that group, 76% said the engagement should be primarily diplomatic and 71% were against a military leadership role for Germany in Europe.\nGerman military officials recently set off a small outcry when they suggested that the country must be \u201ckriegst\u00fcchtig\u201d, which roughly translates to the ability to fight and win a war.\nNorbert R\u00f6ttgen, an opposition legislator and a foreign policy expert with the Christian Democrats, said the term was regarded as \u201crhetorical overreach\u201d and quickly dropped.\n\u201cScholz has always said that \u2018Ukraine must not lose but Russia must not win,\u2019 which indicated that he\u2019s always thought of an impasse that would lead to a diplomatic process,\u201d R\u00f6ttgen said. \u201cHe thinks of Russia as more important than all the countries between us and them, and he lacks a European sense and of his possible role as a European leader.\u201d\nR\u00f6ttgen and other critics of Scholz\u2019s think he is losing a historic opportunity to lead the creation of a European defence ability that is far less dependent on the US military and nuclear deterrent.\nBut Scholz clearly feels most comfortable relying heavily on the United States, and senior German officials say he especially mistrusts French President Emmanuel Macron, who has argued for European \u201cstrategic autonomy.\u201d Macron has found few followers on the continent.\nEven Scholz\u2019s main European defence initiative, a coordinated ground-based air defence against ballistic missiles known as Sky Shield, depends on a mix of US, US-Israeli and German missile systems. That has angered the French, Italians, Spanish and Poles, who have not joined, arguing that an Italian-French system should have been used.\nScholz\u2019s ambitions are also hamstrung by his increasingly weak economy. It shrank 0.3% last year, and roughly the same is expected in 2024. The cost of the Ukraine war and China\u2019s economic problems \u2014 which have hit the auto and manufacturing sectors hardest \u2014 have exacerbated the problem.\nAlthough Scholz acknowledges that the world has changed, \u201che is not saying that we must change with it,\u201d said Ulrich Speck, a German analyst.\n\u201cHe is saying that the world has changed and that we will protect you,\u201d Speck said.\nBut doing so may well require far more military spending \u2014 upward of 3% of Germany\u2019s gross domestic product. For now, few in Scholz\u2019s party dare suggest going that far.\nGermans and even the Social Democrats \u201chave come to the realization that Germany lives in the real world and that hard power matters,\u201d said Charles Kupchan, a Europe expert at Georgetown University.\n\u201cAt the same time,\u201d he said, \u201cthere\u2019s still this hope that this is all just a bad dream, and Germans will wake up and be back in the old world.\u201d\nThis article originally appeared in&nbsp;\nThe New York Times\n.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat type of house are you most interested in?\nSingle-family home\nTownhouse\nSemi-detached house\nVilla\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nGermany\nRussia\nDefence\nNato\nUs\nDo you like the content of this article?\n51\n62\nCOMMENT\n(112)",

For local officials who aspire to take a crack at emulating a celebrated decades-long expansion, it's important not to downgrade a vital component that's become radioactive: immigration. The country's politicians are showing a worrying lapse in memory.\nAs much as any other factor, population growth contributed to the 30-year stretch without a recession that ended in 2020. The country's performance was \"flattered\", in the words of former Reserve Bank of Australia governor, Philip Lowe, by the rising headcount. A mining boom fuelled by China's go-go years, the dramatic economic reforms of the 1980s -- and some luck -- have tended to get the credit. This misses a fundamental ingredient, and it's too bad.\nAussies loved the attention that came with that dream economic run, a happy state that was feted by think tanks and idealised in the corridors of the Federal Reserve. (There was also an unhealthy degree of back-patting at home.) Will that golden era be replicated in the post-Covid world?\nADVERTISEMENT\nFor starters, current leaders need the stomach to stare down one of the country's outbursts of populist aversion to rising numbers of arrivals. Wrestling with a mid-term slump in opinion polls, the centre-left Labor government recently declared it wants substantial cuts. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese pledged to crack down on student visas and tighten conditions for temporary visas available to skilled migrants. It's not long ago that employers were crying out for talent from abroad. Border restrictions during the pandemic slowed immigration, as they did in many countries. Shortages needed to be alleviated.\nSome desire to recalibrate is understandable. There has been a big intake: In the last fiscal year to June 30, there were 518,000 new arrivals, according to the Centre for Population in Canberra. The increase was the most on record. The population has climbed greatly over the decades, almost doubling since 1980 to approach 27 million. There is an inevitable strain on resources. Contrary to images of outback ruggedness popular in books and films, Australia is one of the most urbanised societies. Most residents are crammed into a handful of cities along the southeast coastline. Backlash flares from time to time, some of it nativist and emanating from right-wing talk radio. The surge has been blamed for squeezing an already tight housing market that has seen rents soar in the major cities. Other arguments reflect genuine concern about environmental strain.\nWhat's troubling about this current retreat is the electoral environment in which it is happening. Mr Albanese's administration has been on the defensive for months. There's a sense that it's lost momentum since a referendum on constitutional recognition for indigenous Australians flopped in October. The prime minister campaigned hard for that initiative, and his team seems to be flailing around in the aftermath of defeat. They are unnerved by a slide in approval, a perfect backdrop for populist attacks on immigration to hurt. \"We've got to make sure that our population is sustainable,\" Mr Albanese said in December. \"What I want to see is a system that works for Australia.\"\nWhen officials talk about population, they really mean immigration. Like just about every advanced economy, and quite a few emerging markets, couples Down Under aren't having nearly enough kids to keep numbers steady. This doesn't get enough attention. The fertility rate (TFR) of 1.58 children per woman is well below the generally recognised replacement level of 2.1. While Australia's total fertility rate is fairly high in a region where birthrates are retreating at a rapid clip, the trend is similar. In 1961, Australia's TFR was 3.5.\nThe present kerfuffle is an argument about whether Australians want a country that is big in numbers as well as landmass, and an economy that continues its march up the world tables or just drifts around, ultimately slipping outside the Group of 20, membership of which Australia has often prided itself.\nYou hear very little of this in popular discourse. Mr Albanese has been cowed into adopting the language of the right, using the word \"broken\" to describe the immigration programme. It begs the question: Was it ever \"whole\", and, if so, what did that look like? It's never been entirely free of controversy. That isn't the same as saying there aren't broad merits. Over the decades, a wide-ranging immigration programme has transformed, mostly for the better, Australian cultural and economic life.\nAlso buffeting Labor and getting in the way of a nuanced conversation is the High Court-ordered release of long-term detainees. (Under strict policies that date to the early 2000s, thousands of asylum seekers arriving by boat have been sent to detention centres.)\nSome of those released had been charged with violent crimes, but couldn't be deported due to concerns about persecution, and possibly death sentences, in their countries of origin. The court makes decisions independently, but the government is paying the political price. As will the economy.\nIt's a shame Mr Albanese is spooked. Immigration was enshrined in post-World War II development by the Labor governments of John Curtin and Ben Chifley. Leaders spoke of the need to \"populate or perish\", a slogan that was in part a residual fear of invasion, but also a recognition that a new Australia with different macro-economic and strategic settings had to emerge from the conflict.\nImmigration at that time meant, initially, the UK. It was then broadened to include the Baltic states, the Mediterranean, and the rest of Europe. Race was still relevant: The so-called White Australia Policy endured in practice until the 1970s. After the Vietnam War, newcomers from Indo-China were welcomed.\nTo the credit of conservative leaders in the 1950s, '60s and '70s, immigration retained broad bipartisan support.\nIt would be very unfortunate if a return to pseudo-normality after Covid spelt the demise of a true Australian success story.

(Photo: Reuters)\nChina\u2019s government has blamed corruption for the dismal track record of its men\u2019s football team in a documentary featuring confessions of bribe-taking.\nThe final episode of the four-part documentary series, which highlights corruption broadly in the country, was broadcast on state television on Tuesday, just days before the start of the\nAsian Cup\ntournament seen as a major opportunity for Chinese football to prove that it is on the mend.\nIt comes amid a years-long investigation into the underperformance of the men\u2019s football team after a string of humiliating defeats to countries like Vietnam and Syria, and the failure to qualify for the 2022 World Cup. The narrator of the show likened investigating corruption in the sport to \u201cscraping the bone to remove the poison\u201d.\nADVERTISEMENT\nChina\u2019s men\u2019s football team is ranked 79th in the world by Fifa, in sharp contrast to the women\u2019s side that is just inside the top 20 in 19th place.\nRELATED\nsports\nChanathip makes cup comeback\nsports\nKirins secure a spot in Asian Champions League Two\nChen Xuyuan, former chairman of the Chinese Football Association, said in his confession that he was greeted with two backpacks containing 300,000 yuan ($42,000) each from local officials the night before he was named the chief of the governing body, and took in tens of millions of yuan from clubs in total.&nbsp;\nLi Tie, former coach of the men\u2019s team, admitted he signed a 60-million-yuan deal with a now-defunct club in Wuhan to pick four players into the national team. The club\u2019s former chairman said he blushed when he saw their names: \u201cI know what our players are capable of. There\u2019s no way they could get in.\u201d\n\u201cFootball fans can tolerate the backwardness of Chinese football, but not corruption,\u201d Chen said. \u201cThere\u2019s no remedy for bygones. If there\u2019s one, I\u2019m willing to pay for that with my life.\u201d\nChen and Li have both been charged for bribery.&nbsp;\nTelevised confessions are commonly used by the Chinese government, with the most notable of these being an eight-part miniseries in 2016,\nAlways on the Road\n, that featured high-level officials captured by President Xi Jinping\u2019s anti-graft campaign.\nThe football graft investigation has ensnared at least 14 cadres to date, with dozens of coaches, players, referees and club executives investigated, the documentary said.\nDu Zhaocai, former deputy director of the General Administration of Sports of China, was arrested in October on suspicion of taking bribes and was stripped of his party membership. When authorities ordered an investigation into corruption, Du only produced a research report without naming any problems or punishing anyone, according to the show.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t play a good role as goalkeeper in the corruption fight of Chinese football,\u201d Du confessed.&nbsp;\nPresident Xi has made stamping out corruption a core policy since he took power in 2012, and the extension of that campaign to football is part of the goal to rejuvenate the nation. Xi, a football fan, has also staked his promise of the \u201cChina dream\u201d on the ability of the country to become a sports superpower, in which football is meant to play a leading role.&nbsp;\n\u201cDeveloping and revitalising Chinese football is an inevitable requirement for building a sports superpower, and it is also the expectation of the broad masses of the people,\u201d the documentary said.&nbsp;\nIn 2015, a Communist Party group led by Xi unveiled a sweeping plan to recharge the sport in China, including building more football schools to have a steady talent pipeline, and installing a professional and clean governing body. The medium-term goal was for the men\u2019s team to reach the top in Asia.&nbsp;\nBut things did not progress as planned for Chinese football. Its clubs are mired in financial crisis as generous real estate developers that were big backers of the sport are themselves in the midst of a deep property slump.

Last week, China lost in a friendly against 150th-ranked Hong Kong.\nChinese fans have long complained about the men\u2019s team\u2019s dismal performance, especially compared to the women\u2019s team, which won the Asian Cup in 2022.

With optimism, we learned that Paetongtarn Shinawatra, Pheu Thai party leader and head of the National Soft Power Strategy Committee (NSPSC), has drafted a budget of 5.1 billion baht to boost festivals and creative industries. It is welcoming news to hear this government is priortising art, music, literature, design, fashion, film, food, games, sports and festivals as essential sources for the creative economy. Where this enormous chunk of budget will come from, like digital wallets, remains to be seen.\nRobert Winder's Soft Power: The New Great Game offers shrewd insights on this slippery subject. With reference to superpowers including America, the UK, France, Japan and China, Winder offers various views of friendly persuasion instead of hard power and command. The sphere of influence varies and it takes time to build trust and assurance. Soft power has enormous potential when applied in supple ways and means, especially in areas of foreign diplomacy. Certainly, soft power should not be used blatantly for an election platform to lure people's votes, a majority of whom do not understand or care about differences in soft, sob, sod or soap power.\nInstead of throwing the budget down the drain on lavish events like a long water festival when sustainable water usage is critical, the Thailand Creative and Content Agency (THACCA) under the NSPSC should revisit some ambitious art and culture projects initiated under Thaksin Shinawatra's Thai Rak Thai government. In fact, these unfinished projects can be revived immediately as Thaksin's cronies, now acting as the Pheu Thai Party, can claim success of grandiose ideas initiated two decades ago. The THACCA must realise that soft power is a delicate process of cultural diplomacy and long-term planning, which is opposite to pushy salesmanship and quick-win campaigns for popularity.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe National Art Gallery, as part of the expansion of the Thailand Cultural Centre in the Ratchadaphisek area, has been Thaksin's brainchild since he became prime minister. Then, 35 rai of land was purchased by the Central Bank to expand the complex into the \"Asean Cultural Gateway\" with state-of-the-art technology to support the art gallery, concert hall, theatre, library and Ministry of Culture. Thaksin's vision went so far that Khunying Pojamarn, his wife, acquired a plot of land near this mega project for their new home. Their dream collapsed when the Royal Thai Army staged the 2006 coup and both fled the country amid accusations of conflict of interest and malfeasance in connection with corruption and the land deal. The first phase of the construction of the Ministry of Culture and National Art Gallery slowly went ahead and was completed only after lengthy delay. Sadly, the National Art Gallery, with its cracked and peeling fa\u00e7ade, has not been officially opened two years after completion. The culture permanent secretary office has done little in the way of exhibition programmes, budget allocation and training. With brain-dead vision, there have been few displays of anything from this office. Entering the National Art Gallery is like entering a morgue of galleries and emptiness and dead air. Why are there so few national art collections on display? Over 500 works are kept in storage because the Ministry of Culture has no budget for electricity and air conditioning. Such a diabolical situation needs to be urgently resolved as an unused art gallery does not comply with the THACCA's soft power policy.\nInstead of blindly spending without a roadmap and research, the THACCA should study past Thai Rak Thai projects to promote Bangkok as a city of art and culture. In 2008/9, the Ministry of Culture together with the Central Group, the embassies of India and Japan, and ThaiBev launched a public art project to celebrate King Bhumibol Aduyadej's 80th birthday at CentralWorld. The masterplan was to place permanent sculptures as public landmarks at various sites in Bangkok. The CentralWorld site was to feature outstanding sculptures by Indian, Japanese and Thai artists in celebration of the Thai monarchy, cultural diplomacy and international collaboration. As soft power, this programme truly promoted Bangkok as a destination for art and culture. Grievously, in 2010 when angry Red Shirt protesters outside CentralWorld went on a rampage of arson and looting, a world-class sculpture by Indian artist Ravinder Reddy was badly damaged resulting in a tarnished image of Bangkok. Reddy's The Head is a symbol of humanity and affection that poignantly demonstrates art as a connecting force of goodwill and international relations.\nRELATED\nopinion\nKorea martial law lessons for Thailand\nopinion\nMassages need rules\nThe National Art Gallery.\nThaksin's government received worldwide praise for effectively handling the tsunami aftermath in 2005 that destroyed lives and property along the coast of the Andaman Sea. Art and culture played an integral role in the healing process for all victims and their families through recreational projects and art therapy. Thai generosity and caring became a potent soft power that won the hearts of people across the world. Thaksin laid the foundation stones of the Tsunami Memorial Museum in Khao Lak-Lam Ru National Park, Phangnga, with international representatives and a poetry reading by renowned performance artist Marina Abramovic. Generously, world-famous French artist Louise Bourgeois, donated her priceless sculpture Hold Me Close to the memorial garden at Hat Noppharat Thara-Mu Ko Phi Phi National Park in Krabi. Bourgeois' public sculptures were soft power indeed. Krabi became a world-class destination as tourists flocked to view the one and only public work by Bourgeois in Southeast Asia. Unfortunately, due to negligence, the famous sculpture garden was badly maintained and left in ruins. The sculptures were moved to Krabi Provincial Office and forgotten for many years. Various attempts were made to again display Bourgeois' work, and the Thailand Biennale in Korat attempted to reproduce replicas without consent from the artist.\nLouise Bourgeois' Hold Me Close.\nThe Easton Foundation oversees Bourgeois' art and archive, and stressed that Krabi Provincial Office must get permission in terms of display and reproduction. Bourgeios' intention with her donation was to have the sculpture shown at the original site only. The THACCA should take action in reviving this famous art sanctuary to its original glory. Krabi must realise that long neglected gems by Bourgeois will bring enormous income through cultural tourism. Bourgeois' Hold Me Close is an example of missed opportunity due to local negligence and lack of coordination.\nMuch hype was made about turning Chiang Mai into a destination for movies and digital content. The US$220 million Chiang Mai Wood (CNX-Wood) by Creative Kingdom was hoped to be the new Hollywood of Asia. The megaproject, announced by the Board of Investment, planned to transform Sankampang into a movie-based theme park with state-of-the-art film production studios, cutting-edge animation and special effects facilities with hotels and residential villas. Chiang Mai was slated to be a hub of the creative economy, investment and connectivity with job opportunities for creative workers in the film, animation, gaming and digital industries. Chiang Mai Wood came crashing down due to lack of funding and political change. Such failed projects demonstrate how foreign investment is dependent on government policy and long-term commitment.\nOfficial visits by Thaksin to Paris and then-President Jacques Chirac to Bangkok in 2005 and 2006, respectively, led to the Tout \u00c0 Fait Thai festival that marked the strong bonds between both nations through art and culture. To celebrate King Bhumibol Adulyadej's 60th year as monarch, a khon masked dance was performed at the Palace of Versailles west of Paris, along with a Thai market, puppetry, and contemporary art and music at various museums and art institutions in the city. The grandiose events ended abruptly due to the 2006 coup. In 2025, celebrations for 340 years of relations between France and Siam will be a chance to display Thai art and culture on the international stage.\nThere is still much confusion on the definition and potential of Thai soft power. It took about two years for the Office of the National Economic and Social Development Council, and various ministries, to understand a book like John Hawkins' The Creative Economy: How People Make Money From Ideas. Not surprisingly, announcements of soft power by members of the THACCA have been very hit-and-miss. By proposing fiscal budgets willy nilly, its poorly thought-out projects have received much criticism. The THACCA's announcements of grilled pork, choc-mint drinks, ice cream with Si Thep patterns and lengthy Songkran celebrations as soft power have opened heated debate on its definition.\nThe THACCA should consider constructive programmes that are sustainable and acceptable by stakeholders. They must be open to advice from artists, cultural workers, veterans and youth, and not to be trapped by outdated ideas such as having the TCDC in every province or outrageous proposals like One Family One Soft Power.\nBy letting unimaginative people run haywire, 5.1 billion baht will not be enough to buy back the votes and confidence of the people.\nSoft power is like building with jelly, not cement. Certainly, we do not want to experience endless, empty publicity stunts from any member of the THACCA as part of some soft and soggy NSPSC plan.\nProf Apinan Poshyananda is the author of The Future: Post-Cold War, Postmodernism, Post-Marginalia (Playing With Slippery Lubricants) In Tradition And Change.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat type of accommodation do you usually prefer when traveling in Thailand?\nLuxury hotels (5-star)\nMid-range hotels (3-4 star)\nHostels and guesthouses\nPrivate rentals (Airbnb or villas)\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nSoft\nPower\nTourism\nTourist\nVisitor\nSoft power\nDo you like the content of this article?\n2\n6\nCOMMENT\n(3)",

Appropriately, I should write about the 2024 economic outlook but I have decided to postpone that to be the first article of 2024 as the analysis might be too unpleasant to digest right now. However, I will leave a \"teaser\" for readers to ponder over during the long holidays. As such, I am left with two choices: an article about informal debt -- I estimate outstanding debt to be over 400 billion baht and that it could have strong ties with grey money -- or an article about Thailand's ability to attract foreign investors, as our Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin travels all over the world to attract them. In the end, I opted for the latter.\nMr Srettha is trying hard to lure foreign investors because he correctly believes investment is the only sustainable solution for achieving 5% (or more) of annual GDP growth. According to the government's public relations pitch, 600 billion baht of high-quality investment ranging from Tesla to Amazon Web Services is lining up to enter Thailand. Is this a possible reality or just a PR pitch?\nBefore I answer that, let me give readers a \"teaser\" of my first article of 2024: the year's GDP outlook.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe World Bank, on Dec 14, 2023, came out with a press release showing a 3.2% GDP growth projection for 2024 and a 2.5% growth estimation for 2023 for Thailand. Higher growth prospects come from the recovery in tourism and exports. Wait a minute; I am having a d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu moment here. On June 28, the World Bank issued a press release saying Thai GDP growth for 2023 was set to increase to 3.9% from 2.6% growth the year before. The reason was rising demand from China and the United States and a recovery in the tourism sector. Hmmm.\nThe 3.2% growth target for 2023 is exactly the same number given by the Bank of Thailand and the NESDC (the Thai government's economic planning agency). It can be said that traditional economists have a consensual view on the economy. However, one black sheep economist has a different number.\nRELATED\nopinion\nData paints economy as 'black hole'\nopinion\nTrump tariffs spell trouble for Thailand\nI have done my initial projection for 2024 GDP growth. The answer is: minus 1.5% to plus 1.5%. Thailand's economic growth is at the mercy of foreign creditors. Minus 1.5% growth in case of capital outflow and +1.5% growth in case of capital inflow. The \"base case\" for my projection is 0.0% growth. Before criticising me, I would beg readers to wait two weeks to read the full article, to which the rejoinder may well be: \"This guy's analysis actually makes a lot of sense.\"\nBut back to the issue of competitiveness. Before dreaming about 600 billion baht of foreign investment, please take a look at the table of selected Asean FDI in 2021-2023.\nBefore becoming delusional about future foreign investment, one must explain why Thailand is lagging behind Vietnam and Indonesia. I conclude there are four factors obstructing FDI from coming to Thailand.\nFirst, the Thai population is ageing, as its labour force. The median age here is 40.2 years, compared to 32.8 years in Vietnam and 29.9 years in Indonesia. How about in China? China has a relatively high median age of 39.0 years, mainly due to its former one-child policy.\nSecond, Thailand has a severe labour shortage. The unemployment rate is ridiculously low at 1.06%, which is below the natural rate of 2.0%. Therefore, Thailand has to rely on the help of 2.3 million registered foreign workers (8.5% of the total labour force in the non-agriculture sector) to fulfil labour demand. The number is said to be around 5 million if illegal foreign workers are included.\nThird, Thailand is a relatively high labour cost country. Our per capita income is US$7,298 (250,800 baht) while the numbers are $5,109 for Indonesia and $4,316 for Vietnam. Asking for a big rise in labour costs is therefore counterproductive. Because Malaysia's per capita income is rather high at $13,034, the country shares a similar fate as Thailand. Even with much higher labour costs, Malaysia attracts more FDI than Thailand. Malaysia must be doing something right while Thailand must be doing something wrong.\nFourth, Thailand has high electricity rates, even higher than those of the United States. Modern-day industries rely on automation such as sophisticated machines and industrial robots. Energy is an important cost in the manufacturing process.\nIf Thailand's electricity cost per kilowatt for industrial users is 100, it would be 90 in the United States, 83 in Malaysia, 75 in South Korea, 74 in India, 72 in Taiwan, 66 in Canada, 56 in China, and 46 in Vietnam and Indonesia. This comparison is based on March 2023 data. For electricity intensive industries, I think Thailand is the first choice to locate one's factories.\nIn my opinion, unless these four negative factors are fixed, it would be difficult to see a flood of FDI into Thailand. A great salesman needs good products to sell. If not, the prime minister's effort could be summed up as \"Nato\" (No Action, Talk Only).\nAre there solutions to attract FDI inflows? There are two options -- the quick one and the right one. The quick one is effective but dangerous. It was (unintentionally) used after the financial crisis of 1997. That solution is the sharp depreciation of the baht. After the economy stabilised and the baht dropped to 42-45 per dollar, FDI tripled and investment growth jumped to 12.6% and 15.9% in 2004 and 2005, respectively. \"Cheap Thailand\" would surely attract more FDI.\nIt's not recommended, however. Quick, effective, but suicidal as a quarter of Thai businesses would go bankrupt and another quarter would be sold to foreign investors.\nThe right solution is ... shouldn't the NESDC answer this? However, I will give a hint. If you can figure out why Malaysia can attract FDI despite its high labour costs, you may see the development path Thailand should take. What are Malaysia's core industries and what should our (new) ones be?\nThai people love \"get rich quick\" schemes like the Land Bridge investment project. One trillion baht in and over 200,000 jobs created. A dream project sent from heaven? I have done a simple calculation of the financial feasibility based on the $9.4 billion of actual annual revenue of the Suez Canal. As the Thai Landbridge project would save only 800km of sailing distance compared to the Suez Canal's 6,000km, the former's revenue should be be US$1.25 billion (44 billion baht) a year.\nThat revenue (not profit) is not even enough to service interest rate costs of 50-60 billion baht.\nI do not think investors would be interested in a project with no profit and a high bankruptcy risk.\nSee you again next year.\nChartchai Parasuk\nFreelance economist\nChartchai Parasuk, PhD, is a freelance economist.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWould you consider buying a house in a gated community or as a standalone property?\nGated community\nStandalone house\nEither, depending on location and price\nNo preference\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nChartchai Parasuk\nEconomy talk\nDo you like the content of this article?\n107\n3\nCOMMENT\n(18)",

A new prime minister arrived and a former one returned. Another would-be prime minister came close but it was not to be. Covid retreated, tourists have slowly continued their return, and a full accounting of the plight of Thai workers in Israel is still to come.\nWho had it bad and who had it good across the Indo-Pacific? Read on.\nWorst Year: Asia's Forgotten\nADVERTISEMENT\nIn 2023, Asia's most vulnerable -- often displaced by armed conflict -- remained too often for the most part forgotten. Priorities shifted and the world's attention turned away from \"yesterday's headlines.\"\nRELATED\nthailand\nSingaporean held for making bomb threat against flight\nbusiness\nPM backs new free trade area\nThe most significant escalation in hostilities in Myanmar since the 2021 coup, for example, worsened an ongoing humanitarian crisis in 2023. From Oct 26 to Dec 8, more than 578,000 people were newly displaced in Myanmar on top of nearly 2 million who were already displaced before the surge in fighting according to the United Nations.\nThe UN refugee agency, UNHCR, reports that Bangladesh hosts close to one million Rohingya refugees from Myanmar, making it one of the largest protracted refugee situations in the world.\nIn and outside of Afghanistan, the plight of Afghan women and children remains dire, with Afghan refugees the third-largest displaced population in the world after Syrian and Ukrainian refugees.\nIn 2023, there were at least 8.2 million Afghans hosted across 103 different countries, according to UNHCR, with some in Pakistan now being forced to return to Afghanistan. More than 70% of those in need of support are women and children\nAnd so, we gave \"Worst Year in Asia 2023\" to Asia's forgotten men, women and children -- whether in Myanmar, Afghanistan or elsewhere. Give a thought to how you might learn more and do more to ease their plight in 2024 and beyond.\nBad Year: China's Property Market\nFor millions of Chinese citizens still waiting for homes they put down payments on but might never be built, 2023 was a particularly bad year for China's property market.\nBy some accounts, the nation's ongoing, protracted real estate crisis and debt levels in general may pose the biggest credit risk to the global economy. For many a member of China's middle class, however, the crisis is also a very real threat to their \"China Dream\" and hopes for a better life.\nIn 2021, the real estate giant China Evergrande defaulted on its debt. In 2023, concerns grew over the financial state of Country Garden, which until last year was China's biggest real estate developer, specialising in residential property.\nWith China's economy still growing but slowing and Chinese property prices continuing to fall, the IMF has expressed concern, and Moody's Investors Service has cut its outlook on China's housing sector to negative.\nState-owned financial institutions are reportedly being called upon to prop up developers struggling to avoid default and finish construction of stalled apartment projects.\nStill, some Chinese citizens are refusing to pay their mortgages en masse in a rare form of domestic protest.\nChinese families and individuals who once saw homes as more than somewhere to live but also as investments have reason to fear 2023 won't be the last bad year they face.\nMixed Year: US-China Relations\nUS President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping met at long last again in person this November at the Apec leaders summit in San Francisco -- a bilateral meeting that was a highlight of what was a mixed year for US-China relations.\nThat the two leaders met at all was an accomplishment, and the lowering of tensions was no doubt also welcomed in Japan. 2023 was after all a year marked by the shooting down of what the United States termed a \"Chinese spy balloon\" and continuing tensions on issues ranging from trade, opioids and semiconductors to Taiwan and the South China Sea.\nMr Xi did though to many an Americans' delight indicate that additional pandas might be sent on loan to the United States in an extension of panda-plomacy.\n2024 may well prove an even more of a mixed year as both leaders focus on domestic issues including a US presidential election and a slowing Chinese economy.\nGood Year: Blackpink going global\n2023 might have ended with K-pop global sensation BTS's members in mandatory military service in Korea and with Taylor Swift named \"TIME 2023 Person of the Year,\" but for the four superstar women from Asia who make up the all-female K-pop group Blackpink it was most definitely a good year.\nJisoo (Kim Ji-soo), Jennie (Kim Jennie), Ros\u00e9 (Roseanne Chae-young Park) and Thailand's very own Lisa (Lalisa Manobal) together ended the year applauded by and awarded honorary MBEs (Members of the British Empire) by King Charles at Buckingham Palace for their role in \"bringing the message of environmental sustainability to a global audience as Ambassadors for the UK's Presidency of COP26, and later as advocates for the UN Sustainable Development Goals.\"\nEarlier in April, Blackpink had become the first Asian and all-female band to headline at Coachella and its album Born Pink became the first album from an all-female group to hit No. 1 since 2008. The year also needed with news that Blackpink had finally renewed with YG Entertainment, causing that company's KOSDAQ-listed shares to leap by 26%.\nLike Malaysian actress Michelle Yeoh who made history in March 2023 by becoming the first Asian to win the Academy Award for Best Actress, the members of Blackpink -- from South Korea, New Zealand and Thailand -- have also gone global, adding another dimension to the phrase \"everything everywhere all at once\".\nBest Year: India's&nbsp;Space Agency\nThe region was far from all doom and gloom this August 2023 as ISRO -- the Indian Space Research Organisation -- dazzled the citizens of what is now the world's most populous country and space exploration fans everywhere with its latest lunar mission.\nThe Indian space agency's Chandrayaan-3 (\"moon craft\"-3 in Sanskrit) spacecraft entered lunar orbit on Aug 5, and just over two weeks later, on Aug 24, its lander named Vikram touched down near the lunar south pole, making India only the fourth nation to successfully land on the Moon. A lunar rover named Pragyan would soon be literally making tracks on the Moon.\nAs with India's landmark Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM) -- the nation's first interplanetary mission to planet Mars in November 2013, which made ISRO the fourth space agency to successfully send a spacecraft to Mars orbit -- the relatively low-cost US$74.6 million (2.6 billion baht) Chandrayaan mission demonstrated the power of India's \"frugal engineering\" model. \"India's successful Moon mission is not just India's alone,\" Prime Minister Narendra Modi declared. \"This success belongs to all of humanity.\" And for that reason and for uplifting spirits and bringing a bit of hope and joy in a tough year, ISRO wins \"Best Year in Asia 2023.\"\nFingers crossed for a better year ahead from the Earth to the Moon.\nCurtis S Chin, a former US ambassador to the Asian Development Bank, is managing director of advisory firm RiverPeak Group.

Whether it is new bars, relocated bars or new menus, a bit of liquid cheer never hurt anyone!\nBaccarat Bangkok\nADVERTISEMENT\nBaccarat is the new bar located at the Davis Bangkok Hotel on Sukhumvit 24.&nbsp;\nRELATED\nlife\nGuru's Weekly Buzz: June 14-20\nlife\nSip sip hooray\nThe interiors are a mix of colourful banquettes in navy, green and yellow. Soft candlelight, a crackling fireplace (with climate change, Bangkok may need one, you never know) and candelabras contribute to the warm and inviting vibe, especially this time of the year. Though it does remind one if classic and cosy New York bars. The playlist is a mix of R&amp;B, Afro Latin and House, which sets the mood for after word drinks. Though later in the evening, it deepens to an energetic pulse.\nBut let\u2019s talk about why one is here: the cocktail menu.&nbsp; A creative nod to the iconic card game, Baccarat, each drink is a flavourful. For the more adventurous, there are specially selected spirits in bottles or different shots x six packages, offering an assortment of bold and distinctive concoctions.&nbsp;\nThe O.S.S. Bar\nAdding to the new bar list is The O.S.S. Bar, where the intriguing legacy of Jim Thompson meets masterful mixology.&nbsp;\nNestled within the iconic Jim Thompson Heritage Quarter, the bar offers an immersive experience, blending historic tales with inventive cocktails. The bar draws inspiration from the enigmatic life and mysterious 1967 disappearance of Thompson. Subtle hints of Thompson's connection to the Office of Strategic Services (O.S.S.) is found around the bar through vintage photographs, cherished artefacts and whispered tales that set the stage.\nThe menu showcases Thompson\u2019s myriad adventures and his larger-than-life persona in four chapters. Each chapter, from his early life to his associations with the O.S.S., and his profound connection to Thailand, offers cocktails inspired by pivotal moments and locales in his journey. It is designed as a field manual, where each drink unfolds a tale. Symbols hinting at its flavour profile \u2014 sweet, sour, spicy, bitter or more \u2014 convey a nuanced message in a glass. Instead of traditional ingredients, scenes from Thompson's life offer subtle clues about the cocktail's essence.\n\u201cChapter I - Early Life\u201d&nbsp;delves into Thompson's formative years. Born March 21, 1906, in Greenville, Delaware, US, to a prominent textile magnate father he was a descendant of Union General James Harrison Wilson. This chapter gives rise to two evocative cocktails: The Grand Papa, a luscious, sweet blend, and Class Of 28, a robust drink with subtle bitter notes. \"Chapter II - The O.S.S. Time\" reflects on Thompson's tenure in military intelligence, capturing the essence of missions like \u201cFort Monroe\u201d, \u201cOperation Forth\", \u201cCeylon\" and \u201cC47\". The flavour profiles trace his covert journeys from America, through North Africa and Sri Lanka (Ceylon in those days), culminating in Bangkok.\n\u201cChapter III - Thailand: A Dream Come True\u201d unveils Thompson's time as Thailand's silk king. Celebrate this era with concoctions like the thrilling \u201cGolden Banana\" and the balanced \"The House On The Klong\". While \u201cK.Yee &amp; K.Tun\u201d pays homage to Thompson's dependable cook and houseboy, who were a soothing constant in his life. The chapter concludes with the captivating \u201cSunset At Mekong\u201d, a liquid ode to Southeast Asia's mesmerising allure. \u201cChapter IV \u2013 The Unsolved Mystery\u201d delves into the enigmatic disappearance of Thompson in 1967 in Malaysia's jungles, represented by two cocktails: \u201cMoonlight Cottage\u201d and \u201cMystery\u201d. While the former is inspired by the Cameron Highlands, the later remains the bartender's secret \u2014 every sip evokes the profound mystery surrounding Thompson's last days.\nThere are also crafted mocktails and a curated wine list because by day, The O.S.S. Bar transforms into a tearoom \u2014 The O.S.S. Room \u2014 and offers afternoon tea.\nFind The Photobooth\nForget Sukhumvit 11, the nightlife has moved to Ban Tad Thong Road in Samyan. But don\u2019t take my word for it, the proof is in the fact that Find The Photobooth has relocated and opened shop on the road.&nbsp;\nFind The Photobooth, the sister bar of #FindTheLockerRoom in Thong Lor, has retained its essence of playful innovation and Thai influence. The iconic bar shifts the spotlight to include an electrifying music programme, curated by Kris Chaovalit. With her vast experience in the music industry, Kris is set to infuse the bar with an eclectic mix of genres, ensuring every night is an unforgettable experience of sound and spirits.&nbsp;\nThe music is also reflected in the cocktail menu, where seven&nbsp; major musical chords are compared to classic cocktails and music connotation to the classics with a twist. The link between Find The Photo Booth 1.0 and 2.0 versions is clearly visible, through the classics and classics with a twist concepts.\nFor example, A-major is represented by Aviation cocktails and A-Flat (a connotation of A-Major) is an Aviation with a twist. B-Major is represented by a Boulevardier and B-Minor is its twist. The Flat, Minor, Seven and Sharp also represents the style of the cocktails: Seven=Sour, Minor=Fizzy, Flat=Fruity and Sharp= spirit-forward.\nFind the Photobooth. Find the Music. Find the Magic.\nTropic City\nThe popular bar on Charoen Krung Road has launched their \u201cTropicology Menu\u201d, which is their fourth instalment.&nbsp;\nThe menu mixes, matches and redefines the word \u201ctropical\u201d, expanding flavour profiles. Using techniques found in tiki but also modern complexities, the menu ensures no gimmicks, no trendy concepts, but just new flavours extracted from playing around with different fruits, vegetables, herbs and spices.&nbsp;\nExpect thirst-quenchers like the Copacabana Dub (Flor de Ca\u00f1a 12-year rum, strawberry, umeshu, Bigallet China-China and rhubarb), which is intense; Crossroads (Tito\u2019s Handmade Vodka, port wine, tomato, pineapple, coriander, hot sauce, agave and celery bitters), which is savoury, Double Dance Lover (Stranger &amp; Sons Gin, pandan, goat milk, monsoon mango sticky rice tea and lemon), which is floral, and more. Though I would order the flavourful For A Cooler You (Naked Malt Whiskey, raspberry, mango,&nbsp; apricot, peach, salted maple syrup, roasted coconut and&nbsp; lemon), if just for the glass it comes in.&nbsp;\nIf you want to embrace the vibe to a T, is there anything better than a Pina Colada Supreme (Havana Club 3-Year Rum, pineapple, coconut, lemon and Angostura Bitters)?&nbsp;\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat type of building do you prefer for a condominium?\nHigh-rise (more than 10 floors)\nMid-rise (5-10 floors)\nLow-rise (less than 5 floors)\nNo preference\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nDo you like the content of this article?\n1\n0\nCOMMENT",

Currently, household debt exceeds 90% of Thai GDP as households struggle to make ends meet. (Photo: Patipat Janthong)\nIf one thinks 2023 was a not-so-good year for the Thai economy because GDP growth is likely below 2%, 2024 could be worse owing to three major economic risks: liquidity inadequacy, high gasoline price, and high electricity cost.\nThese negative factors call for an economic contraction rather than expansion. However, government and non-government economic research houses foresee improved economic prospects for 2024.\nThe Bank of Thailand projects next year's GDP growth to be 3.2% (3.8% if the digital wallet scheme is launched), which is higher than the estimated 2.4% growth this year. The Office of the National Economic and Social Development Council (NESDC) shares the same 3.2% GDP growth projection. Krungsri Research, an economic research arm of the Bank of Ayudhya, has a more optimistic view of 3.4% growth.\nADVERTISEMENT\nI do not live in a dream world. The Thai Tom Yum Kung experience of 1997 and the US Hamburger Crisis of 2008 are examples where economists failed to incorporate economic risks into their GDP projections.\nThe NESDC then forecast 7.1% growth for 1997, while the World Bank projected 2008 global GDP growth to be 3.6%. Actual GDP growth rates for those years went in the opposite direction. Why? Because crises happened.\nRELATED\nopinion\nTrump's tariff blackmail boosts Brics\nbusiness\nSCB welcomes digital transformation\nAll GDP projections for 1997 Thailand missed the mark. Academic projections of 6.8%-7.2% GDP growth rates shamefully failed to give even the slightest hint of a troubled economy.\nOn the contrary, the projections showed stronger growth prospects over 1996's GDP growth of 5.7%. As we now know, the Thai economy was in deep trouble for several years, but economists blindly ignored it as the philosophy of \"tomorrow must be a brighter day\" overshadowed economic facts.\nThe economy exhibited signs of distress in the first half of 1997 as GDP growth rates were 0.4% in Q1/1997 and -2.0% in Q2/1997. The reason was a severe liquidity shortage, measured in terms of negative excess liquidity of 1.4\u20131.5 trillion baht, persisted throughout the first half of 1997. A severe liquidity shortage prevented the economy from growing in Q1 and Q2. The currency attack in June 1997 caused the economy to collapse in Q3 and Q4 with -3.0% and -6.2% growth, respectively.\nThe painful truth is that the liquidity shortage did not start in Q1/1997 but started a few years before. An increasing dependence on foreign capital was glaringly evident. By January 1996, negative excess liquidity was already at a very high level at 1.1 trillion baht. The liquidity shortage increased to 1.4 trillion baht by the end of 1996. All economists, except myself, did not recognise such a significant red flag and carelessly projected the economy to improve in 1997, assuming an infinite inflow of foreign capital.\nReaders must be curious to know the most recent figure for negative excess liquidity. Using Bank of Thailand data, negative excess liquidity is 800 billion baht for October 2023. The economy has faced negative excess liquidity since August 2021, starting with a small liquidity shortage of 94.2 billion baht. The liquidity shortage peaked at 1.023 trillion baht in August 2023. After that, the figures (mysteriously?) improve.\nHow does the financial system survive an extended period of liquidity shortage? Much like before the 1997 financial crisis, Thailand borrowed from abroad to fill the liquidity gap. From 2020-22, Thailand borrowed an additional US$28 billion (900 billion baht) to fulfil domestic demand for liquidity, causing external debt at the end of Q4/2022 to rise to $200 billion or about 40% of GDP.\nIt must be said that external debt to GDP is not excessively high by international standards, but creditors can be cruel when things don't look too good. In Q2/2023, $9 billion of external debt was recalled, which was why the liquidity shortage passed the 1 trillion baht mark in August.\nAs such, there is no doubt that the main risk for 2024 is one of liquidity arising from dependence on foreign borrowing. To have GDP growth of 3%, the economy needs at least half a trillion baht of new liquidity to support it.\nIn a normal year, such liquidity would be attained by borrowing $15 billion from abroad. But with a high level of external borrowing, a bleak economic outlook, and the global credit risks of Argentina and China, more foreign borrowing would be next to impossible. Thus, 2024 will be another year of massive liquidity shortage. The problem is that no foreign funding might fill the gap.\nBut that is not the end of the story; a more serious risk could be hidden behind a slow economy. That is capital outflow risk triggered by credit defaults. Over the past two decades, local banks favoured household lending over business lending. Consequently, corporates sought funding from abroad to replace local financing. Corporates' foreign debt to GDP ratio rose from 18% in 2012 to 24% in 2022. With many years of low economic growth, we could see a string of defaults in 2024, leading to aggressive recall of loans from foreign creditors.\nSome good news: readers can be assured that a crisis like 1997 will not be repeated in 2024. The Tom Yum Kung crisis was a \"balance of payments\" crisis stemming from inadequate foreign exchange reserves. Currently, Thailand has more than enough foreign reserves to cover 100% of external debt.\nAnd now some bad news: a financial crisis like Japan's in the 1990s and the US's in 2008 could occur in 2024. Both Japan and the US have no problem with the balance of payments or capital outflow of any kind; bad debts caused their banking systems to collapse and pushed them into financial crises.\nIn 2024, rising bad debts from the household sector (outstanding loans 90.7% of GDP) and business sector (outstanding loans 81.2% of GDP) could bring the Thai banking system to near-disaster levels.\nEven without a liquidity threat, the economy is set to face two more important risks in 2024. The first is the risk of rising fuel pump prices. After the government transferred the cost of subsidising 5 baht per litre of diesel fuel to the Oil Fuel Fund on July 21, the debt burden of the fund increased by 30 billion baht, averaging 7 billion baht per month.\nWithin three months from now, the fund's outstanding debt will exceed 100 billion baht, which makes the fund incapable of supporting retail oil prices and cooking gas. A 5 baht per litre increase in diesel pump price might be inevitable, and the impact on the economy, particularly on transport costs, would be tremendous.\nFollowing in the footsteps of the Oil Fuel Fund is the issue of electricity. The government artificially suppressed electricity prices from 4.45 baht per unit to 3.99 baht per unit in September-December. However, there is no free lunch, and the Electric Generating Authority of Thailand (Egat) has borne the cost. The fair price, ie causing no extra financial burden on Egat, for January-April 2024 should be 4.68 baht per unit. As the government is under pressure to set the price lower than 4.2 baht per unit, Egat could bear the cost again.\nBut by the next round of electricity rate pricing for the May-August 2024 period, Egat will not be able to bear any further burden without bankrupting the organisation. Electricity prices could jump to as high as 5 baht per unit. That will be another significant blow to the economy. With all these three risks waiting in 2024, any GDP projections, ignoring to incorporate such risks, are nothing but wishful numbers from ivory towers.\nChartchai Parasuk\nFreelance economist\nChartchai Parasuk, PhD, is a freelance economist.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nIf you were to buy real estate in Thailand outside of Bangkok, which area would be your top choice?\nChiang Mai\nPhuket\nPattaya\nKhao Yai\nKoh Samui\nHua Hin\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\n2024 GDP\nDo you like the content of this article?\n118\n2\nCOMMENT\n(17)",

He was blessed with a good footballing brain.\nAs a student, I was fortunate enough to see Venables in action regularly playing for Chelsea at Stamford Bridge in the early-to-mid 1960s.\nADVERTISEMENT\nI still have programmes from that era with Venables playing at\nNo.10\nwhich in those days was known as \"inside left\".\nRELATED\nopinion\nCan technology end corruption?\nsports\nWood spearheads Forest revival: From relegation battles to top 3\nChelsea had an exciting forward line.\nFor the match against AC Milan in the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup on Feb 16, 1966, the Blues forward line was Barry Bridges, George Graham, Peter Osgood, Venables and Bobby Tambling. That was quite a line-up by any standards.\nFrom what I can recall of Venables' performances, he was a clever player and always looked comfortable on the ball.\nHe didn't score lots of goals for Chelsea (26 in 202 appearances) but created many chances for his teammates.\nThe Chelsea manager at the time was Tommy Docherty and Venables was known as one of \"Docherty's Diamonds.\"\nHowever, Venables didn't get on that well with his Scottish boss who he thought was a poor tactician.\nNear the end of the 1965-66 season, Venables was involved in a major row with Docherty who suspended him and seven other players for breaking a curfew.\nVenables was upset with what he felt was petty behaviour by Docherty which he described as \"crass.\"\nIt came as no surprise when Docherty put Venables on the transfer list and he went on to enjoy three seasons with Tottenham before moving to QPR and finally Crystal Palace.\nSurprisingly he only played twice for England.\nHe began his managing career with successful spells at Crystal Palace and QPR before taking on a huge challenge at Barcelona.\nIn a dream start, he went on to lead Barcelona to their first La Liga title in 11 years.\nVenables was proud of his achievement at Barcelona and commented: \"A lot of people seem to think I was just a slippery cockney boy with a few jokes.\n\"It's taken one of the biggest clubs in the world to acknowledge what I can really do -- coach.''\nDuring his time in Spain, the British tabloids could not resist dubbing him \"El Tel\".\nWhen asked what he missed most about London he replied: \"The sausages\".\nFrom 1994-96, Venables proved a popular England manager of a team which included Paul Gascoigne and Alan Shearer.\nPlaying an attractive style, the team reached the semi-finals of the 1996 European Championship.\nAll the players praised his man-management.\nVenables knew how to handle the gifted but sometimes troubled Gascoigne.\nVenables was Tottenham manager in 1992 when Gazza was sold to Lazio.\nVenables was concerned how Gascoigne would handle life in Italy, remarking: \"I'm pleased for him but it's a bit like watching your mother-in-law drive off a cliff in your new car.\"\nWhen Venables was sacked by Alan Sugar at Tottenham in 1993 Gascoigne complained: \"Tottenham without Terry is like Westminster without Big Ben.\"\nVenables could be quite an entertaining football commentator.\nAt the 2002 World Cup, when a Brazilian free-kick pierced China's defensive wall, he remarked: \"You would think that if anyone could put up a decent wall, it would be China.\"\nOutside of football, Venables co-wrote a television crime series called Hazell, featuring a cockney private detective.\nA final word from Gascoigne: \"Terry was the best I ever worked with -- everybody loved him.\"\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat is your preferred price range per night for accommodation in Bangkok?\n1,000 - 3,000 THB\n3,000 - 5,000 THB\n5,000 - 8,000 THB\nOver 8,000 THB\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nKickbacks\nNobby piles\nPremier league\nBritish football\nDo you like the content of this article?\n2\n0\nCOMMENT\n(1)",

He was 100 years old.\nThe name Kissinger is often paired with \"realpolitik\" -- diplomacy based on power and practical considerations.\nLauding his cold-eyed view of advancing US interests, admirers compared him to history's great statesmen such as Bismarck, Metternich or Richelieu.\nBut for many, especially on the left, Kissinger was seen as an unindicted war criminal for his role in, among other events, expanding the Vietnam War to two more countries, supporting Chile's 1973 military coup, green-lighting Indonesia's bloody invasion of East Timor in 1975 and turning a blind eye to Pakistan's mass atrocities during Bangladesh's 1971 war of independence.\n- 'Fortuitous series of events' -\nBorn Heinz Alfred Kissinger into a Jewish family in Fuerth, Germany, on May 27, 1923, the future architect of American foreign policy fled the Nazi regime in 1938 with his father, a schoolteacher, his mother and a younger brother. The family resettled in New York.\n\"I thought I'd be an accountant,\" he told USA Today in 1985. \"I never thought I'd teach at Harvard. It wasn't my dream to become secretary of state.\"\n\"I could not have had a more fortuitous series of events occur.\"\nKissinger worked at a shaving brush factory while he attended high school at night.\nUpon graduation, he studied accounting at the City College of New York but was drafted into the army in 1943 before he could graduate.\nHis knowledge of German landed him in an infantry division intelligence unit tasked with identifying Nazis as the Allies advanced in Europe.\nIn the army, Kissinger met his first mentor, fellow German refugee Fritz Kraemer, a political scientist who persuaded him to transfer to Harvard, where he earned a bachelor's degree in 1950 and doctorate in 1954.\nThe young professor's first book, \"Nuclear Weapons and Foreign Policy\" (1957) -- on how the new, ultra-destructive weapons should be adapted to the requirements of diplomacy -- quickly rocked the field.\n- Redefining US relationships -\nKissinger's ambitions went beyond academia: he wrote for think tanks and took consulting jobs for the National Security Council and State Department under presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson.\nThese included trips to Vietnam, where the United States was becoming increasingly involved as part of its Cold War doctrine of containing communism.\nSeeking government service, Kissinger supported New York governor Nelson Rockefeller, a liberal Republican who unsuccessfully ran for president three times. In 1968, Kissinger switched support to Nixon, who would make him his national security advisor.\nDistrustful of the State Department's career diplomats, Nixon accurately believed that his dogged advisor would make the White House the center of foreign policy and he named a low-profile secretary of state, William Rogers, who was seen as lacking the intellectual heft of Kissinger.\nBut by late 1973, with Nixon becoming embroiled in the Watergate scandal that would end his presidency, Rogers quit and Kissinger became secretary of state, keeping the post until January 1977 following Ford's election defeat to Jimmy Carter.\nIn an unprecedented arrangement that demonstrated his absolute influence, for two years Kissinger remained national security advisor while serving as secretary of state.\nNixon had built his political name on strident anti-communism but he welcomed Kissinger's concept of \"detente,\" a methodical effort to find areas in which the United States could ease tensions with the Soviet Union.\nKissinger shepherded the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT) with Moscow, the most serious effort to control the Cold War nuclear arms race. In 1972, the superpowers reached the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, imposing limits on their arsenals.\nAs part of a strategy of isolating the Soviet Union, as well as shaking up diplomacy on Vietnam, Kissinger took a landmark decision that would arguably become his most consequential -- reaching out to communist China.\nSelf-isolated amid the destruction brought on by Mao Zedong's Cultural Revolution, mainland China since the 1949 communist victory had been cut off from the United States, which recognized the defeated nationalists who had fled to Taiwan.\nKissinger secretly flew to Beijing in 1971 via Pakistan and met Premier Zhou Enlai, paving the way for Nixon's breakthrough trip a year later in which the president clinked glasses with Zhou, visited the ailing Mao and set the stage for diplomatic relations and, decades later, the intertwining of what would be the world's two largest economies.\n- Cold-eyed tactician -\n\"That China and the United States would find a way to come together was inevitable given the necessities of the time,\" Kissinger wrote four decades later in \"On China,\" one of some 20 books.\n\"That it took place with such decisiveness and proceeded with so few detours is a tribute to the leadership that brought it about,\" he wrote with an understated immodesty typical of him.\nKissinger's overtures eventually led the way for Western businesses to flock to China, which by the 21st century had grown into an emerging rival to the United States.\nDomestically, ending the divisive Vietnam War was a top priority. Nixon campaigned on achieving \"peace with honor\" and upon taking office, he and Kissinger began a policy of \"Vietnamization\" that would force the South Vietnamese allies to take on a larger role so that US troops could withdraw.\nSeeking to strengthen the US hand ahead of peace talks, Nixon and Kissinger authorized a 1969-1970 bombing campaign in Laos and Cambodia aimed at disrupting rebel movement into South Vietnam.\nThe bombing, which was not authorized by Congress and kept secret from the public, did not halt the infiltration but killed thousands of civilians and helped spawn the genocidal Khmer Rouge.\nKissinger traveled several times to Paris, at first discreetly, for talks with North Vietnamese negotiator Le Duc Tho.\nAn agreement was finally signed in January 1973 that effectively ended US military operations, and the two men were jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, although only Kissinger accepted it.\nShowing his cold calculus, taped conversations with Nixon revealed that Kissinger had fully expected South Vietnam to fall after the accords.\nIn another example of his realpolitik, Kissinger recommended that the United States delay weapons shipments to ally Israel after it was attacked in the 1973 Yom Kippur War, believing Arab states would be more confident to make peace after achieving initial victories.\n- Overlooking abuses -\nThe record of Kissinger -- who headed the \"40 Committee\" that directed foreign intelligence operations -- has drawn intense scrutiny.\nIn a 2001 book, \"The Trial of Henry Kissinger,\" writer Christopher Hitchens made a case that he should be prosecuted for war crimes and crimes against humanity.\nDeclassified documents show a direct US role in undermining the government of Chile's Marxist elected president Salvador Allende, including support for officers who murdered a general who refused to participate in a 1970 coup attempt and backing for the eventual 1973 takeover by General Augusto Pinochet.\nKissinger was also criticized for allowing the Indonesian regime of Suharto, a close anti-communist ally, to use his US-equipped military to seize East Timor in 1975. The invasion was launched one day after Kissinger and Ford met Suharto in Jakarta.\nMore than 100,000 East Timorese died during the Indonesian occupation that ended in October 1999, according to a 2005 estimate by the now independent nation's truth commission.\nKissinger similarly showed little compunction when Greece's military junta deposed the elected leader of Cyprus, Archbishop Makarios, and Turkey invaded the island in response.\nNonetheless, Kissinger's intellect made him a brief, if niche, sex symbol as rumors swirled of his relationships with Hollywood celebrities.\nIn 1974, at the pinnacle of his power and a decade after his first marriage ended, Kissinger wedded the former Nancy Maginnes, the strikingly tall former aide to Rockefeller. She survives him, as do two children from his first marriage, David and Elizabeth.\nKissinger was kept at arm's length when the Republicans returned to power under Ronald Reagan, who began with a more ideological bent.\nBut Kissinger rarely passed up opportunities to dispense advice, readily shuttling from his Manhattan penthouse to Washington when leaders called.\nAs Kissinger wryly observed in the 1970s, \"Power is the ultimate aphrodisiac.\"\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat is your budget range for renting a condominium?\nUnder 10,000 THB/month\n10,000 - 20,000 THB/month\n20,000 - 40,000 THB/month\n40,000 - 60,000 THB/month\nOver 60,000 THB/month\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nDo you like the content of this article?\n0\n0\nCOMMENT",

(File Photo)\nSAN FRANCISCO - Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin is pitching the government\u2019s trillion-baht southern land bridge project to US investors as a way to significantly cut shipping times between the Indian and Pacific oceans by bypassing the Strait of Malacca.\nMr Srettha told investors in San Francisco on Monday that the project could cut travel time by an average of four days and lower shipping costs by 15%. With traffic volumes projected to exceed the Strait of Malacca\u2019s capacity by 2030, the new project will ensure seamless flow of goods, he said.\nThe land bridge project is expected to cost about 1 trillion baht, with seaports to be built in Ranong on the Andaman Sea and Chumphon on the Gulf of Thailand and linked by road-rail and pipeline network. The 100-kilometre connection would replace a centuries-old proposal to dredge a canal through the Isthmus of Kra.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe Ranong-Chumphon project is the latest in a decades-long parade of proposals to create a link between the Andaman and the Gulf of Thailand and reduce the need for shipping via the Strait of Malacca.\nPrevious proposals have failed to catch on, with opposition from communities and environmentalists a key obstacle.\nRELATED\nthailand\nPhatthalung to push airport plan\nthailand\nGovt drawing up bill&nbsp;to get southern Thailand's Land Bridge going\nThe Strait of Malacca&nbsp;\u2014 a narrow sea lane between Malaysia and Indonesia&nbsp;\u2014 is the shortest sea route linking the Asia-Pacific region to India and the Middle East. About a quarter of the world\u2019s traded goods pass through the strait and it will only become busier, pushing up shipping costs, Mr Srettha said, noting that there are more than 60 maritime accidents a year on average in the passage.\n\u201cThe land bridge will be an additional important route to support transport and an important option for resolving the problems of the Malacca Strait,\u201d he said. \u201cThis will be a cheaper, faster and safer route.\u201d\nThe port in Ranong would have capacity to handle 19.4 million 20-foot containers, and the one in Chumphon is designed for 13.8 million containers, together accounting for about 23% of the Port of Malacca\u2019s total cargo, he said.\nThe prime minister said the project, which he has also pitched to investors in China and Saudi Arabia in recent weeks, will help create 280,000 jobs and propel the country\u2019s annual economic growth rate to 5.5% when fully implemented.\nThe land bridge \u201cpresents an unprecedented opportunity to invest in this commercially and strategically important project that connects the Pacific Ocean and the Indian Ocean, connecting people in the East with the West\u201d, he said.\nCommentary:\nLand bridge just a pipe dream?\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhich app or platform do you usually use to book accommodations?\nBooking.com\nAgoda\nAirbnb\nTrip.com\nTraveloka\nExpedia\nSkyscanner\nDirectly with the accommodation\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nSouthern land bridge\nLand bridge\nRanong\nChumphon\nDo you like the content of this article?\n14\n57\nCOMMENT\n(18)",

Last year, Sunak suggested that a \"golden era\" of warm relations between Britain and China during Cameron's 2010-2016 tenure had been \"naive\".\nAnd Cameron recently slammed Sunak's decision to scrap a key part of a high-speed rail project.\n\"Though I may have disagreed with some individual decisions, it is clear to me that Rishi Sunak is a strong and capable prime minister, who is showing exemplary leadership at a difficult time,\" Cameron said Monday.\n- 'Privilege' -\nHis shock return surprised even political commentators, who noted it was at odds with Sunak's recent pitch at the Tory conference to end the \"30-year status quo\" in British politics.\nTim Bale, politics professor at Queen Mary University of London, said Sunak was likely drawn to Cameron's \"clout on the international stage\" and hoped to appeal to increasingly dissatisfied moderate voters.\n\"I'm very sceptical that it'll make much difference on that or any other score,\" he noted. \"It looks desperate -- because that is what it is!\" he told AFP.\nPolling in September suggested 45 percent of UK adults felt unfavourably towards Cameron, while only around a quarter held a favourable view.\nThe idea that the appointment formed part of Sunak positioning himself to fight the next election, which must be held by January 2025, on more centrist ground was aided by his dismissal of outspoken right-winger Braverman.\nHer position became increasingly untenable after she last week wrote an explosive newspaper article, without Sunak's approval, accusing police of bias towards left-wing causes.\nCritics said her comments had encouraged far-right protesters to hold counter demos on the sidelines of the main march on Armistice Day on Saturday.\nDowning Street launched an investigation into how the article was published without its consent, as required by the ministerial code.\nBraverman stoked controversy throughout her tenure, regularly wading into so-called \"culture wars\" issues, reportedly harbours ambitions of one day leading the Tories.\nShe described homelessness as a \"lifestyle choice\" and has attacked her critics as liberal \"tofu-eating wokerati\".\nShe also called sending asylum seekers to Rwanda her \"dream\" and \"obsession\".\nFollowing her dismissal, Braverman said \"it has been the greatest privilege of my life to serve as home secretary\".\nBut she warned ominously: \"I will have more to say in due course.\"\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat is your preferred house size (in terms of number of bedrooms)?\n1 bedroom\n2\u20133 bedrooms\n4+ bedrooms\nNo preference\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nDo you like the content of this article?\n2\n21\nCOMMENT\n(9)",

In between are a train and truck that connect the two coasts.\nThe short video promoting the scheme for the Transport Ministry is even more eye-opening. \"A port in Ranong will be developed to be a world-class business centre. A port in Chumphon will become the location of a world-class green, hi-tech industry,\" it says.\nThe die-hard project has come back to life again as the government of Srettha Thavisin has dusted off the scheme and started a campaign to drum up support.\nADVERTISEMENT\nPast governments had been trying to do just what the prime minister is doing now and went nowhere. But the real estate tycoon-turned-politician has promised it will be different this time. \"I am determined to make it happen,\" he told the Economic Reports Association forum on Oct 25.\nThe cabinet has already given the green light to an estimated construction cost of at least 1 trillion baht. Where will the money come from? No worries. It will be under the public-private partnership format. The government will take care of land appropriation and a one-metre gauge train track to connect it with the existing southern rail line.\nRELATED\nopinion\nSpending plans?\nopinion\nA missing link\nThe rest to be carried out by private investors includes a deep-seat port in Muang district of Ranong on the Andaman and another one 90 kilometres apart in Lang Suan district of Chumphon on the Gulf of Thailand; a motorway, gas and oil pipelines and another train line with a wider track exclusively built to transport goods for the project.\n\"This may be one of the largest megaprojects in the world, which would make Thailand an attractive country for investment,\" the prime minister said.\nThe government will soon hit the road to sell the project to investors. It dreams of starting construction in 2025 and seeing it operational by 2030.\nThe government is optimistic investors will buy into this scheme during road shows, thanks to its location and potential. The land bridge project can save time for ships of up to 10 days from using the busy Malacca Straits, and investors will be allowed to operate it for 50 years before handing it over to the state.\nEverything about the bridge to connect the two waters looks rosy, at least on paper and in PR stunts. But it might be different in reality. And last year's pre-feasibility study by Chulalongkorn University (CU), commissioned by the National Economic and Development Council, has already pointed out some issues on the other side of the story.\nSaving time by using this shortcut is not the only issue that all ships factor in as they have to calculate the double-handling cost of containers loaded from one ship to another waiting on the other side of the coast, the study says. The land bridge project would be attractive only for main vessels to unload freight to feeders, while ships sailing non-stop between the two seas will be not interested in using the Thai bridge, it adds.\nAnd do not forget the two southern provinces where the land bridge is situated have a valuable price to pay. Tourism in Ranong would be in danger, especially when the country is considering proposing Mu Ko Ranong National Park and Laemson Marine National Park as World Heritage sites in the long run as the land bridge and port stand on the buffer zone within three kilometres of the parks.\nLang Suan district in Chumphon is not on the main tourist map but it is one of the fruit bowls in the southern regions famous for rambutan and mangosteen. In addition, coastal fishing communities and farmers will have to make way for the new infrastructure to be built on the two coasts and inland.\nAt least what is recommended in the CU study is worth considering. It suggests infrastructure which is already there in the South, from the railroad to roads and ports, be improved rather than going ahead with this megaproject.\nThe project began in 1993 when Chuan Leekpai was the prime minister, to link Krabi and Nakhon Si Thammarat. Thailand even convinced Malaysia in 1994 to join the scheme to rival the Singapore port by linking the ports in Penang and Songkhla. More sites have been mooted since then, including Satun and Songkhla. Every time the plan is raised, it always ends up back on the shelf with no one interested in putting up the huge sums needed.\nHistory loves to repeat itself, and this land bridge project is no exception.\nSaritdet Marukatat is a Bangkok Post columnist and former Digital Media News Editor at the paper.

(Photo: Chanat Katanyu)\nThe Pheu Thai-led government's decision to acquire a Chinese-made frigate instead of a submarine in the wake of problems and delays with the original purchase came as no surprise following Pheu Thai's intense scrutiny of the scheme.\nThe submarine deal remained in limbo for months after it was revealed that China had failed to procure a German-made MTU 396 engine for the submarine on order and offered the Chinese-made CHD620 engine instead.\nAccording to the original agreement signed in 2017, Thailand was to use the German-made engine in an S26T Yuan-class Chinese submarine it ordered from China. However, Germany now forbids engines made domestically from being used in Chinese military hardware, so China proposed that a Chinese-made engine be used in the submarine.\nADVERTISEMENT\nAfter several rounds of negotiations and assurances that the Chinese engine would be up to the task, former navy chief Adm Choengchai Chomchoengpaet said before his retirement, the navy was prepared to recommend the Chinese-made engine.\nAs it turned out, the government decided not to proceed with the submarine procurement and proposed to buy a Chinese-made frigate as an alternative.\nConsidering Pheu Thai's criticism of the purchase when it was in opposition, it was foreseeable that the project would not see the light of day upon coming to power.\n\"There has been no order from the government or the Pheu Thai Party. It is a solution worked out by the Defence Ministry and the navy,\" Defence Minister Sutin Klungsang said.\nHowever, a naval source said the frigate proposal was drawn up following the meeting between Mr Sutin and the navy. To avoid being associated directly with the party, Mr Sutin reportedly instructed the navy to explore alternatives if the submarine deal could not go ahead, the navy source said, which was confirmed by a source in the Defence Ministry.\nAccording to the naval source, the navy, therefore, came up with two proposals -- one was to buy a Type 054A Jiangkai II frigate, and the other was to purchase a Corvette Type 056 Jiangdao offshore patrol vessel (OPV).\nHowever, the navy already has seven frigates in its fleet, with the Prayut Chan-o-cha cabinet approving its plan to acquire a new one with an estimated cost of 17 billion baht in the 2024 fiscal year.\nWhile the new frigate project is not yet finalised, South Korea is said to be high on the tentative list of suppliers. The navy's seventh frigate -- HTMS Bhumibol Adulyadej -- was built by South Korea under a budget of 14.9 billion baht and commissioned in January 2019.\nAccording to the source, the submarine is essential to the navy's strategic and defence capabilities plan, although the number is reduced to one from originally three. China is obliged to take responsibility and compensation for its failure to fulfil the contractual requirement.\nThe navy had held talks with China Shipbuilding &amp; Offshore International Co (CSOC), which is contracted to build the submarine under a government-to-government agreement, but the firm could offer only free spare parts for eight years and free training.\nIf the government agreed with the change from the German-made engine to the Chinese-made engine, it would have been expected to lobby China to hand over two second-hand submarines to Thailand for training as it awaited the purchased submarine's completion and delivery in about three years.\n\"CSOC never responded to the second-hand submarine request, so that issue would have needed to be handled by the government. The second-hand submarines are part of the Chinese navy fleet, not owned by the firm,\" said the naval source.\nIt is possible that the Pheu Thai-led government will consider a new submarine acquisition scheme after Mr Sutin expressed his interest in a German-made submarine under a barter trade agreement, the source said.\nMr Sutin's decisive role in scrapping the Chinese-made submarine deal has several political analysts reassessing the defence minister and his role in military affairs, particularly military reforms.\nThe S26T Yuan-class submarine was originally due to be delivered to Thailand this year, but the pandemic had postponed its delivery to next April.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat type of house are you most interested in?\nSingle-family home\nTownhouse\nSemi-detached house\nVilla\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nSubmarine\nDo you like the content of this article?\n60\n31\nCOMMENT\n(24)",

(Photo: AFP)\nHANGZHOU, China - Squash has never been in the Olympics despite decades of trying, but players and officials hope that the 150-year-old sport will finally get its big chance in 2028.\nWhen it comes to Olympic recognition, squash has always ended up with the wooden spoon, failing with bids to make the past four Games.\nIt is one of nine sports vying for a place at the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics, along with the likes of cricket, lacrosse and motorsport.\nADVERTISEMENT\nSquash faces a nervy wait before the decision, which could be taken at the International Olympic Committee session in Mumbai this month.\nWorld Squash Federation president Zena Wooldridge told AFP she was optimistic, but admitted it could go either way.\n\"There's a lot of talk about cricket, there's a lot of talk about baseball, lacrosse is an indigenous sport to the USA,\" she said at the Asian Games in Hangzhou.\n\"There are lots of different advantages and disadvantages of each being discussed, but we just don't know. We don't have control.\"\n&nbsp;'It's weird'\nSquash is played around the world, has a professional tour for men and women, and features at the Commonwealth Games, Asian Games and Pan American Games.\nThe action is fast and furious, especially in doubles, where players frantically clamber over each other to reach shots.\n\"It's a cross between a racquet sport, a combat sport and, if you were to put doubles in there, some acrobatics as well,\" said Wooldridge.\nMixed doubles is making its Asian Games debut alongside men's and women's singles and team events.\nIndia won the men's team title with a 2-1 win over Pakistan that Indian team member Abhay Singh said was \"the most-talked-about match at the Asian Games\".\n\"To have something of that magnitude go down at the Olympics would absolutely be so amazing,\" he said.\n\"It's very weird to me why squash is not in the Olympics.\"\nSpace Invaders\nSquash is widely played recreationally but it has not always translated well as a spectator sport.\nPlayers must make an effort to get out of each other's way so they can hit the ball, but the hectic nature of the game means points are often unclear and decided by the referee.\nHong Kong's Tong Tsz-wing, who was part of the women's team that won silver in Hangzhou, said \"the subjective nature\" of the game can be a problem.\n\"But I don't see a reason why we can't handle it and we've been trying hard to do that,\" she said.\n\"I just feel like we should have a fair chance.\"\nWooldridge says squash chiefs have worked to make the sport more appealing to audiences, putting courts in locations such as theatres and making commentary easier to understand.\nShe says technology is changing the sport, with courts now able to install interactive playing walls that function like \"a giant iPad\".\n\"You could put Space Invaders on there and you hit the front wall \u2014 your finger becomes the ball,\" she said.\n\"There's all kinds of innovations that you can bring to the sport to almost make it a combination of eSports and physical sport.\"\nWhether squash's new ideas will be enough to finally give it a place at the Olympics remains to be seen.\nESports has been a big hit at the Asian Games and the IOC is keen on bringing in sports that appeal to younger audiences.\nBreakdancing will make its Olympic debut next summer in Paris and skateboarding did so in Tokyo two years ago.\nOf the more traditional racquet sports, tennis, table tennis and badminton have all been included for at least the last 30 years, leaving squash out in the cold.\nWooldridge says appearing at the Olympics would be \"the pinnacle\" for players and Indian gold medallist Singh agrees.\n\"That's the dream, isn't it,\" he said.\n\"Every athlete wants to be at the Olympics.

With projections that the vehicle fleet will double by 2050 and the increasing GHG emissions, there\u2019s an urgent need to reimagine our roads. Electric vehicles (EVs) are emerging as the clear frontrunners in this shift towards sustainable transportation.\nIn Thailand, this shift is more pronounced than ever. The streets of Bangkok, infamous for their traffic jams and consequential emissions, underline the urgency of the situation. However, there\u2019s light at the end of this smog-filled tunnel.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThailand\u2019s Electric Aspirations\nThe Eastern Economic Corridor, covering parts of Chon Buri, Rayong, and Chachoengsao provinces, has identified the next-generation car industry as a cornerstone of its development. The Federation of Thai Industries predicts a production of 1.9 million vehicles this year, with significant exports planned. To spur this electric revolution, the government has rolled out incentives, with tax cuts and subsidies for car manufacturers and importers.\nRELATED\nthailand\nMitr Phol Leads Green Sugarcane Harvest for Sustainability&nbsp;\nthailand\nBangkok's Air Quality Crisis Demands Urgent Action Now\nThe government\u2019s vision is not just about economic growth. A move towards EVs is intrinsically linked to Thailand\u2019s carbon neutrality goal by 2050. The phenomenal 1,605.4% surge in battery EV sales from January to July this year signals the nation\u2019s readiness for this change. Newly appointed Industry Minister Pimphattra Wichaikul encapsulated the mood, stating the EV industry is Thailand\u2019s new bullet to a strengthened, long-term economy.\nU-Drive: Steering Thailand Towards a Sustainable Future\nAgainst this transformative landscape, UOB Thailand presents U-Drive: a monumental step towards cleaner, more efficient transport. U-Drive isn\u2019t just about cars; it\u2019s about creating a comprehensive financial ecosystem that empowers stakeholders across the EV spectrum.\nFrom automotive brand owners, car dealers to EV Charging Infrastructure providers, U-Drive ensures that electrifying transportation isn\u2019t just an aspiration, but a tangible reality. This initiative isn\u2019t just about selling cars; it\u2019s about creating a sustainable ecosystem. The programme provides support to the entire value chain facilitating the country\u2019s transition to greener transport.&nbsp;\nU-Drive isn\u2019t just another transformative programme. Designed to be a beacon for green mobility in Thailand, it is a sustainable financing solution, envisioning a greener and cleaner Thailand.\nCollaborations with key industry players, for example, BYD Auto Industry and Rever Automotive, and EVCI partners are testaments to U-Drive\u2019s holistic approach. Through cutting-edge green trade financing facilities tailored to bolster Rever Automotive, this collaboration extends to their entire dealer network, catalysing the growth of eco-friendly businesses across the nation.&nbsp;\nTo this end, UOB Thailand has established Green and Sustainable Trade Finance that facilitates the seamless import of EV cars from BYD China to Rever. And it doesn\u2019t stop there. Rever\u2019s local distributors benefit from UOB Thailand\u2019s Green Distributor Financing Programme, empowering them to bring BYD cars to the hands of Thai customers.\nThe Road Ahead\nAs the world grapples with environmental challenges, it is endeavours like U-Drive that offer a glimmer of hope. With its comprehensive sustainable financing solutions, UOB is championing the cause of green finance, reaffirming its commitment to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.\nThe transportation landscape of ASEAN is undergoing a paradigm shift, and with initiatives like U-Drive, UOB positions itself as not just a spectator but as an agent of change. They\u2019re not just building a portfolio; they\u2019re crafting a vision for tomorrow.\nIn conclusion, as we stand at the crossroads of change, it is collaborations like UOB Thailand\u2019s U-Drive that illuminate the path forward. By seamlessly merging finance with sustainability, U-Drive proves that the road to a cleaner, greener future is not just a dream but a journey that has already begun.\nThis article is part of a\n20-part series\nthat explores what it takes to create and secure a sustainable future.

Large\n15\n3\nBeijing says the facilities were voluntary centres for teaching vocational skills, closed years ago after their inhabitants \"graduated\" into stable employment and better lives\nARTUX (CHINA) - A policeman waves reporters away from a desert prison in Xinjiang, part of a network of detention facilities transformed by China's shifting policies in the northwestern region.\nSince 2017, more than a million Uyghurs and other Muslims have been swept into internment camps where human rights abuses are commonplace, researchers, campaigners and members of the diaspora say.\nBeijing says the facilities were voluntary centres for teaching vocational skills, closed years ago after their inhabitants \"graduated\" into stable employment and better lives.\nADVERTISEMENT\nAds powered by\nAnalysts counter that some camps have been refitted as others have shut down.\n\"Several hundred thousand\" people have likely been sent to work at high-security industrial parks while others languish in renamed or repurposed compounds, said Darren Byler, an assistant professor at Canada's Simon Fraser University who studies detention patterns in Xinjiang.\nIn July, AFP attempted to visit the sites of 26 alleged camps in Xinjiang named in research by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI).\nSome bristled with staffed guard towers, security cameras and high walls topped with barbed wire, while others lay in disuse.\nASPI, a think tank partly funded by Western governments, used satellite imagery, public documents and other sources to pinpoint the locations.\nBeijing rejects its findings.\n- 'Nothing may be photographed' -\nAccording to ASPI, at least eight camps dot the landscape around the mostly Uyghur city of Artux.\nOne alleged detention centre seemed to be built around 2017 and was expanded the following year, the group says.\nTo reach the site, three AFP reporters drove along a highway closely followed by a convoy of unmarked cars.\nAfter an hour, they reached a turnoff blocked by metal gates bearing the insignia of China's public security ministry.\nBeyond them, a road stretched into the desert towards a group of buildings in the distance.\nThe gates opened to allow other vehicles to pass, but remained shut when AFP drove up.\nAn AFP reporter asked a Uyghur policeman if they could enter.\n\"This is a prison -- you definitely can't come in,\" he replied, adding that it was a \"restricted area\".\n\"Nothing may be photographed or filmed,\" he said politely but firmly.\nThe policeman did not respond to questions about people interned at the facility and AFP left the area.\nA total of 10 sites observed by AFP appeared operational based on the presence of staff and the condition of external security infrastructure.\nSome compounds, often in remote areas, spanned hundreds of thousands of square metres, hidden behind five-metre-high walls with razor wire and watchtowers.\nAFP was not able to enter any Xinjiang prisons, or identify anyone who was indisputably incarcerated.\n- Fallen into disuse -\nA further five sites of alleged detention centres seem to have fallen into disuse.\nThese areas matched ASPI's descriptions but were abandoned, and showed signs that security architecture had been removed.\nAFP drove into an ordinary-looking residential complex about an hour's journey from the city of Kashgar.\nThere, a crumbling wall around three metres high stood among rows of identical apartment blocks.\nCiting satellite imagery, ASPI says the wall was built in 2017 to seal off four blocks of the complex.\nNew structures likely housing detainees were built inside the perimeter, which had a high-security entrance.\nLater imagery shows much of the security apparatus was removed from around 2019, according to ASPI research.\nAFP reporters were able to walk freely into that part of the complex.\nChildren kicked a football outside the entrance to one of the four apartment blocks.\nBetween the blocks lay rows of derelict prefabricated sheds.\nMost were locked and empty, but inside some of them, bunk beds, tables and other furniture could be seen.\nIn one, scores of dust-caked sewing machines lay on rows of desks.\nTo protect their safety, reporters did not ask any locals whether the buildings had been used for detentions.\n- Converted -\nA further seven sites now appear to have been converted, including a pair of buildings on either side of a quiet stretch of road an hour southwest of Kashgar.\nASPI says the buildings housed a \"re-education facility\" called Konasheher-6, but it appeared to change role in 2019.\nAFP reporters walked along the road between the structures, which were bordered by metal railings and connected by a covered walkway.\nNow, the low-slung pink-and-yellow blocks appear similar to regular Chinese schools.\nThey looked out onto a well-kept football pitch, a running track, basketball and volleyball courts and ping-pong tables.\nA painted slogan urged pupils to \"study hard... to realise the Chinese Dream\", invoking a pet phrase of Chinese President Xi Jinping.\nUnusually, a blue-and-white police box opened onto one side of the sports area, though it was unclear if it was staffed.\nThe visit took place during the summer holiday and no schoolchildren were there.\nBut at other such locations identified by ASPI, AFP saw groups of teenagers playing football and other sports.\nOther places were marked for other uses, including training centres for Communist Party officials.\nA few kilometres southeast of Kashgar, five-metre-high walls topped with electric wire towered over a sleepy farming village.\nConstruction waste piled high beneath the exterior walls, but a glance through an entrance gate revealed well-maintained interior lawns and buildings.\nA security guard confirmed that the site used to be a detention centre but said that \"all the people inside have now gone\".\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat type of hotel location do you prefer in
