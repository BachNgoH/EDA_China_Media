    "content": "Jakarta.\n&nbsp;The education system in Indonesia is still facing several challenges, including low teacher competence, decreased student enthusiasm for learning, and persistent physical infrastructure issues.\nTeachers and educational staff must come up with innovations and find solutions to address these limitations. This is the approach taken by two school principals from Karo Regency, North Sumatra, Serma Ulipa Simbolon and Viadya Stella Tololiu.\nWhen Serma was first assigned to head the SDN 040470 elementary school in Linggajulu, Simpang Empat, Karo&nbsp;a year ago, she was shocked by the school's condition. The building was in a very poor state, and it had been decades since the walls were last painted. The doors and locks were damaged. There were even bee nests in the office. It also lacked access to sanitation.\n“We had to use the bathroom at residents' homes or hold it until we got home. The children urinated everywhere, so by midday, there was a foul smell. It was uncomfortable for [the students] to learn at school,\" Serma said.\nThere was also another problem. The teachers had lackluster competence, some even only chose to teach in a conventional manner. This prompted local residents to think twice before sending their kids to SDN Linggajulu, even preferring to have their children study in other villages or districts. As a result, the school only had a total of&nbsp;90 students. In 2018, local residents even held a protest because the school had not improved its quality.\nSocial Innovation\nThis undated photo shows SDN 040470 principal Serma Ulipa Simbolon&nbsp;holding a meeting with her teachers. (Photo Courtesy of Tanoto Foundation)\nSerma immediately tried to identify the problems, citing the leadership factor as one of the top reasons why the school had failed. She then initiated a social innovation that involved a collaboration between the school and the village. Despite the lack of access to clean water, there was a nearby well that students could use.\n“We approached the village officials and participated in a local meeting. I told the forum that the school belongs to the village of Linggajulu, and is a place for&nbsp;educating future generations. So, we must work together to improve the quality of the school,” Serma said.\nSerma’s presentation touched the village officials and residents, who then worked together to donate water from the well to the school and even build a pipeline.\nReports were also made about the school’s frequent damage and dirtiness. She found out that local youth had been loitering around the school. The village officials helped Serma stop the youth from causing further harm to the school. Things have been improved since then.\nAfter improving the school facilities, Serma decided to focus on improving the teacher's competence. She formed a community of teachers who taught at the school. This Sabar community -- which stands for \"Sabtu Belajar\" ('Saturday Lessons\") -- bring together the teachers to learn from each other over the weekend. They all shared the problems that they faced, and looked for solutions together.\nSerma had learned all these tricks by joining the PINTAR program held by the Tanoto Foundation back in 2018. Serma at the time was a teacher at SDN 040460 Brastagi. She admitted that the program had taught her how to be more creative.\n“I shared what I had applied in terms of active learning. Since I still have&nbsp;all the materials, photos, and videos, I share them [with the local teachers]. I also share the PINTAR materies to other teachers and schools&nbsp;because they are well-suited to develop a new learning paradigm. These PINTAR materials are very practical to apply,” she explained.\nViadya Stella Tololiu's Story\nViadya Stella Tololiu is a principal at SD Filadelfia School in Karo.\nShe came up with an innovation that boosted the learning ecosystem using a gamification approach. By adopting popular game models, Viadya was able to motivate children into learning.\n\"The focus is on teachers creating gamified learning that uses game methods. Learning becomes like a competition or game where students earn scores or progress through different levels,\" said Viadya, who also participated in the Tanoto Foundation’s PINTAR program in 2020-2021.\nThe games varied. For example, Viadya created a treasure hunt game with questions related to the subjects, with different levels of difficulty. If students could answer a question, they would move on to the next level with harder questions until they found a \"treasure\".\n“This keeps the kids active and enhances the learning experience. We see significant improvements in students’ report cards in 2024,” she said.\nViadya explained that today’s challenges for teachers are not just the learning materials themselves but also competing with social media platforms like YouTube and TikTok.\n“Kids get bored quickly at school. If we don’t change our teaching methods, they won’t be interested,” she added.\n&nbsp;PINTAR Program\nThis undated photo shows Viadya Stella Tololiu, who is a principal at SD Filadelfia School in Karo. (Photo Courtesy of Tanoto Foundation)\nThe PINTAR training from the Tanoto Foundation has helped teachers avoid monotonous teaching styles and engage students more actively. Serma said that the students had also become more motivated with this new approach. Teachers have also become more active.\nSerma also encouraged SDN Linggajulu teachers to join various workshops to gain more experience.\n“This Learning Leadership Innovation is slowly changing the community’s view of SDN Linggajulu. Changing people’s perception from negative to positive isn’t quick—it took almost a year for the mindset to change,” she said.\nThis innovation had helped Serma win first place as the innovative school principal in North Sumatra. This competition was part of the teacher jamboree program, and was organized by the Education Ministry.\n“The first-place winners from each province are invited to Jakarta for the award ceremony and five favorite innovations will be selected. I hope we make it,” Serma said, as she had already arrived in Jakarta.\nSecond-place winner Viadya said that the PINTAR training had inspired her to create the gamification method.\n“At that time, gamification was used for online training for teachers and principals during the pandemic. I thought if it could be applied to kids, it would be even more fun, since they love playing games like Mobile Legends and others,” she said.\nSince then, Viadya replicated the gamification method used in the Tanoto Foundation training and applied it to teaching 170 students at SD Filadelfia School.\n“The challenge is that teachers must keep being creative while teaching through play. We will continue to develop this method in the future,” said Viadya, who has been the school principal for nine years.\nThe Tanoto Foundation's PINTAR program (Innovation Development for Learning Quality) aims to improve the quality of basic education in Indonesia by enhancing the skills of teachers, leadership quality and management of school principals, and supporting local governments in creating policies that foster improved learning quality through technical assistance to the government.\nTags:\n#Special Updates\nKeywords:\nTanoto Foundation\nSHARE\nURL berhasil di salin."

    "content": "North Penajam Paser\n.&nbsp;Residents of North Penajam Paser Regency affected by the construction of the airport and toll road in the future national capital, Nusantara, have received compensation for their crops and land through the agrarian reform program.\nBoth projects cover approximately 400 hectares of land in the regency in East Kalimantan.\nLandowner Harto, one of the beneficiaries who received Rp 357 million in compensation for his crops, expressed his satisfaction with the solutions provided by the Land Bank Agency, the Ministry of Transportation, and the Ministry of Public Works.\n“At first, there were rumors that there would be no compensation, and we were told that our land would be seized. But after the process continued, we received word from the Land Bank Agency that there would be compensation for both the land and the crops, and we accepted it,” Harto said in a statement.\nAdvertisement\nHe said the arrival of the Land Bank Agency initially faced protests from the community. However, regular meetings and information-sharing efforts conducted by the Land Bank Agency with the residents led to positive outcomes.\nSimilarly, Eko Rahman from Gersik Village, North Penajam Paser, shared the same sentiment. He said that at first, residents were anxious about the announcement boards put up by the Land Bank Agency without prior notification, fearing that their land would be confiscated by the government.\n\"It turned out not as we feared. The residents are happy to receive compensation for the crops. We never expected our land to become part of the Nusantara Airport. We in Gersik, Jenebora, and Pantai Lango are happy. We never imagined that an airport and a city would be built here,\" he said.\nEko added that he received compensation for crops valued at over Rp 40 million, part of which he used for his children's education and his wife’s needs.\n“We are looking forward to the future for our children and grandchildren. If the compensation is taken fully, we will lose our land. The land is getting more expensive,” he added.\nHe said the Land Bank Agency has always communicated with the community in a persuasive manner.\n“There was no intimidation. The Land Bank Agency has a good relationship with the community. It’s as if they are providing solutions so that the land becomes the people’s property,” he concluded.\nThe agrarian reform was managed by the Land Bank Agency will be carried out in stages. Stage I will focus on communities affected by the construction of the Nusantara Airport and toll road, or Section 5B of Nusantara.\nThe Head of the Land Bank Agency, Parman Nataatmadja, said that since the acceleration of the agrarian reform program began in the first year of President Joko Widodo’s administration, it has been mandated that all beneficiaries must manage the Agrarian Reform Objects optimally and productively. The Land Bank Agency has been tasked with providing at least 30 percent of land for agrarian reform and is committed to fulfilling this responsibility to the best of its ability.\nThe Agrarian Affairs and Spatial Planning Ministry has also allocated 1,873 hectares of land for agrarian reform purposes in North Penajam Paser, East Kalimantan, under the management of the Land Bank Agency.\n\"This is a responsibility we must fulfill as the government's extension in the agrarian sector, not just a promise. We want the beneficiaries to manage the Agrarian Reform Objects optimally,\" said Parman in a press statement on Tuesday.\nParman said the implementation of agrarian reform on the Land Bank Agency’s land concession rights is now in its final stages. The agency, in collaboration with the Ministry, continues to accelerate the process.\n\"There are just a few more steps before the certificates can be issued,\" he said.\nThe agrarian reform will focus on communities affected by the construction of the Nusantara Airport and toll road, or Section 5B of Nusantara, covering approximately 400 hectares.\nResidents affected by the Nusantara Airport construction will not only receive land but also compensation for their crops through the Social Impact Handling Scheme. The Transportation Ministry and the Public Works Ministry are also involved in the program.\nThis initiative is part of the government's efforts to ensure that the development of infrastructure projects, such as the Nusantara Airport and the toll road, benefits local communities while respecting their rights to land and resources.\nTags:\n#Social\nKeywords:\nLand Bank Agency\nThe New Capital City\nSHARE\nURL berhasil di salin."

    "content": "Jakarta.\nNewly-installed President Prabowo Subianto wants to make Indonesia everybody’s friend, but Jakarta’s friendliness does not mean it will ignore colonialism that is taking place on the planet.\nPrabowo delivered his inaugural speech as Indonesia’s eighth president at the national legislature complex in Jakarta on Sunday morning. Speaking before the audience which included&nbsp;world leaders, Prabowo unveiled how he would manage Indonesia’s foreign policy. According to the 73-year-old politician, Indonesia will stick to its free and active foreign policy. Southeast Asia’s largest economy also still has no plans to join any military pacts.\n“I have always said that Indonesia wants to be a ‘good neighbor’ in its foreign policy. … We will adopt the old philosophy of ‘having a thousand friends is too few, one enemy is too many’,” Prabowo said.\nThe former army general added: “We wish to be good friends with all countries, but we will embrace the principle of anti-colonialism. … We are against oppression because we have been oppressed before.”\nAdvertisement\nIndonesia was under Dutch colonial rule for hundreds of years, and eventually got occupied by Japan for over three and a half years. Because of this, Indonesia knows what it feels like to be in the shoes of oppressed countries. According to Prabowo, traces of Dutch colonialism even remained years after Indonesia declared its independence in 1945. Prabowo recalled how he saw a board that read “\nhonden en inlander verboden\n” -- the Dutch for “dogs and native Indonesians are prohibited” -- when visiting a pool in Manggarai back in his military days in 1978.\n“We were even seen lower than dogs [in the past]. … That is why we have that solidarity principle. We have to defend the oppressed, and that is why we support Palestinian independence,” Prabowo said passionately.\nPrabowo then talked about what Indonesia under the previous Joko “Jokowi” Widodo government had done for Palestinians, including the distribution of logistics aid. Indonesia has partnered with the United Arab Emirates to send their medical workers to treat wounded Palestinians.&nbsp;\n“Indonesia stands ready to deploy more [logistics aid], and evacuate those injured and the traumatized children. We will prepare all hospitals, including the military ones, to help our brothers and sisters who are victims of the unfair war,” Prabowo said.&nbsp;\nPrabowo's&nbsp;speech revealed that Indonesia would continue its resource nationalism -- an economic policy that has ruffled the feathers of the European Union (EU). The policy sees Indonesia banning exports of unprocessed nickel ores -- and eventually other commodities -- in favor of processing these resources domestically.\nIn the past, Jokowi had said that exports of raw materials were a practice that dated back to the colonial era and had been detrimental to the economy as Indonesia lost countless economic opportunities from exporting higher-value goods. Prabowo also wrapped up his nearly hour-long speech with another affirmation of Indonesia’s anti-colonialism stance.\n“We do not want to disturb other nations, but we also do not allow any nation to disturb us,” Prabowo said.\nA number of world leaders, including Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim and his Singaporean counterpart Lawrence Wong, also flew to Jakarta to see Prabowo’s inauguration in person. Timor Leste's Prime Minister Xanana Gusmao was also in attendance.&nbsp;\nPresident Prabowo Subianto hugs Timor Leste Prime Minister Xanana Gusmao on the margins of the former's first plenary session as president at the national parliamentary complex in Jakarta on Oct. 20, 2024. (Antara Photo/Rivan Awal Lingga)\nWorld leaders who skipped the inauguration -- and sent representatives instead -- had begun sending their congratulatory messages. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese wrote that he “looks forward to continuing to strengthen the partnership” between both nations in a social media post uploaded shortly after Prabowo’s inauguration. Chinese news agency Xinhua reported Sunday that China’s President Xi Jinping had also congratulated Prabowo on the start of his presidency.\n“Xi also expressed willingness to maintain close strategic communication with Prabowo to guide the building of a China-Indonesia community with a shared future to a higher level,” Xinhua wrote.\nTags:\n#International\nKeywords:\nPrabowo Subianto\nPrabowo Inauguration\nAnti-Colonialism\nDutch colonialism\nResource Nationalism\njokowi\nXi Jinping\nSHARE\nURL berhasil di salin."

    "content": "Jakarta.\nIndonesia needs to pay attention to developing its early childhood education if it wishes to achieve a golden era by its centennial in 2045, and this calls for a multi-stakeholder collaboration.\nAccording to UNICEF Indonesia’s country representative Manisa Zaman, children need to have access to early childhood education.\n“The first years of life really shape a child’s future and a generation. It will determine what will happen to them later in life, including in terms of education, jobs, and whether they will be productive,” Maniza said in the “Unlocking Potential” program presented by the philanthropic organization Tanoto Foundation.&nbsp;\nBabies’ brains are only a quarter of that of an adult. Their brains will double in size once they are a year old. A baby’s brain is capable of making a million new connections every second. The first thousand days of a child are also a golden opportunity for growth and development.\nAt the age of five, a child's brain development has reached 90 percent. Research showed a child who attends preschool would do better in school, be more confident, and even become a productive citizen in the future. A child without early childhood education would perform poorly at school or even drop out.\n“One year of pre-school learning really lays the foundation for numeracy, literacy, and character building. The benefits are incredible,” said Maniza.\n“These early years are important to maximize a child’s potential. This is the right time to invest in early childhood. Imagine what Indonesia will get if that investment starts and for the future.”\nEarly childhood education is crucial for a country as big as Indonesia. In economic terms, every Rp 1 invested in its development will yield four times the profit. About 20 years from now, Indonesia’s population is predicted to reach 380 million people. Around 60 percent of that number are of productive age, thus granting Indonesia a demographic bonus.\n“That means we have to prepare now. The future workforce is being born now or will be born soon. Timing is important if Indonesia wants to generate a demographic bonus,” Maniza said.\nChallenges in Integrated Early Childhood Education\nIndonesia is developing an integrated and holistic early childhood education program that not only teaches children but also provides nutrition and health services. Indonesia is also mulling making 13-years of education --including pre-schools-- mandatory.\nThere are, however, still many challenges. Only 35 percent of children aged 3-6 years have access to early childhood education. Pre-schools are also quite rare in Indonesian remote areas. The government also set aside little state money to develop early childhood education, only making up 0.8 percent of the total state budget for the education sector. This is far below the 10-percent international benchmark.\nMany pre-schools also still lack quality teachers. This is a result of assumptions that preschool teachers do not require good qualifications. Only 60 percent of preschool teachers have a bachelor’s degree, data showed. A lot of parents do not consider enrolling their children in preschools as important. Indonesia also needs to make sure that its preschools are affordable for everyone at all levels.\nAll these challenges call for greater support and investment from multiple stakeholders, including the government, private sector, non-governmental organizations and philanthropic institutions. UNICEF and the government had worked together at the regulatory and infrastructure levels. It made use of technology to campaign good early childhood education practices and preschool learning materials. Companies where the parents work also play a role.\n“Companies should come up with family-friendly policies. … Happy employees mean a successful business,” Maniza said.\nThe private sector can also use all resources to increase the number of early childhood education services or provide technical support, assets, and experts. Non-governmental and non-profit organizations take advantage of their networks to improve the quality of preschools. The role of community leaders and religious leaders is no less crucial in providing motivation and enthusiasm for parents to carry out good parenting.\n\"All of this can amplify the message about the importance of early childhood education for the future of a nation and show that every party has a role to play in it,\" Maniza said.\nTags:\n#Special Updates\nKeywords:\nearly childhood education\nPreschool\nUnicef\nTanoto Foundation\nUnicef Indonesia\nSHARE\nURL berhasil di salin."

    "content": "Jakarta.\nNickel miner Vale Indonesia recently took home the 2024 Subroto Award for the community development and empowerment performance category.\nVale has developed a pineapple agrotourism program in Tabarano, a village in South Sulawesi, in partnership with the local government. As part of the program, Vale has helped transform the disaster-prone idle land into a sustainable agricultural area. This not only helps make the region more environmentally resilient but also helps boost community welfare.\nVale reported that it had donated 15,000 pineapple seedlings that were planted on 1.5 hectares of land to keep the area drought-free.\nThe program also helps spur job opportunities as it trains locals to grow pineapples by producing their very own organic fertilizers. The Tabarano Pineapple Agrotourism also functions as a social, recreational, and educational center, according to Vale’s chief sustainability and corporate affairs officer Bernadus Irmanto.\n\"Every step we take, including the Tabarano Pineapple Agrotourism program, reflects our commitment to the environment and society. Sustainability is a shared responsibility, and we hope this program can provide significant benefits for the community to face future challenges,\" Bernadus was quoted as saying in a press statement.\nBernadus said that Vale had adopted a holistic approach in implementing its environmental, social, and governance (ESG) principles. This enables the company to create a synergy between sustainability and industry. The freshly earned award would also motivate Vale into creating more programs that have a positive impact on the environment and society. Other initiatives include waste management, tree planting, and public health programs that focus on improving the quality of life.\nTabarano village head Rimal Manukallo commented on the partnership with Vale Indonesia.\n\"With this pineapple agrotourism, we can empower residents in need. We have also employed a number of residents [in this project]. We also plan on expanding this [agrotourism] area in the future,” Tabarano village head Rimal Manukallo said.\n\"We plan to build facilities such as compost and production houses. We also want to develop it into a tourism destination,” Rimal said.\nIn 2018, Vale won the Subroto Award for the best environmental management. It then won an award the following year for the mining environmental protection category. The company also brought home an award for having the most innovative health-related community empowerment program in 2022.\nTags:\n#Special Updates\nKeywords:\n2024 Subroto Award\nSubroto Award\nVale\ncommunity empowerment\nVale Indonesia\nSHARE\nURL berhasil di salin."

    "content": "Jakarta.&nbsp;\nAs a developing country, Indonesia faces numerous challenges in its journey to become a developed nation. These include the quality of education, environmental issues, and economic inequality. Achieving the vision of Golden Indonesia 2045 is challenging without immediate and adequate preparation.\nOne critical factor that can either be an asset or a burden if not prepared early is the younger generation. According to the Central Bureau of Statistics (BPS), in 2023, approximately 9.9 million young people (ages 15-24) were neither employed, attending school, nor participating in training. This demographic, referred to as youth not in education, employment, or training (NEET), represents 22.25 percent of the total population in this age group nationwide.\nThese young people are the future drivers of the nation, the architects of development, and the leaders of sustainable growth in Indonesia.\nTherefore, it is crucial to identify, train, and support potential future leaders from an early age. In response to this need, Tanoto Foundation, an independent philanthropic organization in education founded by Sukanto Tanoto and Tinah Bingei Tanoto in 1981, through its TELADAN program, supports the creation of reliable future leaders who can contribute sustainably to society.\nThe TELADAN program provides scholarships and structured leadership training to students from ten partner universities. A key component of the learning journey for TELADAN scholarship recipients (Tanoto Scholars) is the annual Tanoto Scholars Gathering (TSG). This year, TSG 2024 is held again in Pangkalan Kerinci, Riau.\nBenny Lee, the chief executive officer of Tanoto Foundation, kicks off Tanoto Scholars Gathering in Pangkalan Kerinci, Riau on July 28, 2024. (Handout Photo)\nBenny Lee, CEO of Tanoto Foundation, stated that the founder, Sukanto Tanoto, has a 5C vision applied across all his business groups: good for the community, country, climate, customer, and company.“ The 5C vision means we must impact the first four Cs before considering our own organization or ourselves. Tanoto Foundation embraces this vision because our work must benefit society and the nation,” he said during the opening ceremony of the Tanoto Scholars Gathering (TSG) 2024 on Sunday.\n“You will also visit RGE factories to see how they apply continuous improvement. This is crucial for Tanoto Scholars to always seek opportunities to improve and develop themselves,” Benny added.\n“Take advantage of this TSG to get to know each other well, as this will form your future network. Support each other and grow together as leaders,” Benny concluded.\nEduward Ginting, COO of PT Riau Andalan Pulp and Paper (RAPP), also inaugurated TSG 2024, emphasizing that PT RAPP pioneered business sustainability implemented in April 2030. “We believe that the more sustainable we become, the more competitive we will be. Likewise, you are being prepared to be leaders committed to sustainability. With a sustainability mindset, you will focus on creating long-term value that goes beyond financial profits to impact society, the environment, and the nation,” Eduward added.\nFormer minister Bambang Brodjonegoro becomes one of the speakers at the Tanoto Scholars Gathering 2024. (Handout Photo)\nProf. Bambang Brodjonegoro, Minister of Finance (2014-2016), Minister of National Development Planning/Head of Bappenas (2016-2019), and Minister of Research and Technology (2019-2021), who opened the inspirational talk session, stated that human development is key to Indonesia becoming a developed country.&nbsp;\n“What Tanoto Foundation does through TSG 2024 and its leadership scholarship program aligns with this goal. As we aim to become a developed country, we will go through a period where sustainability and digital transformation stand out globally. Thus, incorporating sustainability as a theme is an acknowledgment of its future trend, achieved through digital means,” Bambang said.\n“As the digital generation, you can contribute by implementing digital transformation supporting crucial sectors like economy, politics, environment, and health, while still considering the needs of the underprivileged, such as fishermen and farmers. The role of youth is crucial. You must be critical thinkers, change makers, innovators, communicators, and leaders,” Bambang added.\nTSG 2024 also featured speakers like the Chairman of the Indonesian People's Consultative Assembly (MPR), Bambang Soesatyo; Minister of Agrarian and Spatial Planning, Agus Harimurti Yudhoyono; and Tanoto Foundation scholarship alumni. One notable alumnus is Prof. Cahyadi, the youngest professor at Universitas Sebelas Maret, Solo, who shared his educational journey and contributions to the education sector.\nAbout Tanoto Scholars Gathering 2024\nTSG is part of Tanoto Foundation's leadership and scholarship program named TELADAN (Teaching Leadership, Advancing the Nation). TSG brings together Tanoto Scholars from across Indonesia and abroad, providing opportunities to network, learn from influential figures and fellow Tanoto Scholars, gain exposure to the working world, and meet directly with Tanoto Foundation mentors and management. TSG marks the transition in leadership development within the TELADAN program from “lead self” to “lead others.”\nHeld from July 28-30, 2024, in Pangkalan Kerinci, Riau, TSG 2024 is attended by 195 Tanoto Scholars from partner universities, including IPB University, Diponegoro University, Gadjah Mada University, Brawijaya University, University of Indonesia, North Sumatra University, Andalas University, Bandung Institute of Technology, and Riau University, as well as Tanoto Scholars from Singapore.\nDuring TSG 2024, Tanoto Scholars engage in a series of activities over three days, starting with industrial visits to observe firsthand how RGE, founded by Sukanto Tanoto, practices sustainability in their operations. They also visit the RGE Technology Center, APRIL paper mill, APR rayon mill, Asian Agri palm oil plantation, and the Kerinci Central Nursery for acacia and eucalyptus seedlings. These visits aim to provide participants with insights into the working world after graduation and introduce them to sustainable industry practices, inspiring them to develop a sustainability mindset.\nFollowing this, leadership workshops are conducted, including outbound activities where scholars learn teamwork, discipline, quick decision-making, and strategic planning through various games. This experiential learning is a significant component of the program for Tanoto Scholars.\nTanoto Scholars also have the opportunity to gain knowledge and engage in discussions with expert speakers, including former Minister of Research and Technology Prof. Bambang Brodjonegoro, Chairman of the MPR Bambang Soesatyo, Minister of Agrarian and Spatial Planning Agus Harimurti Yudhoyono, Professor of Animal Husbandry at UNS Prof. Cahyadi.\nTSG has been held annually since 2010 and is an integral part of the Tanoto Foundation's holistic scholarship and leadership development program. The theme for TSG 2024, \"Learn and Lead: Becoming the Heart of Sustainability,\" aims to shape Tanoto Scholars into leaders aware of sustainability and capable of creating a lasting positive impact in various fields.\nTanoto Foundation scholarship program has been running since 2006, benefiting 8,338 students by 2023. In 2018, the program evolved into TELADAN, a comprehensive program offering scholarships, structured leadership training from the second to eighth semester, and alumni mentoring upon graduation.\nTELADAN has three development stages, with TSG marking the transition from \"lead self\" to \"lead others\" before scholars move to the professional preparation stage and eventually become alumni.\nTags:\n#Special Updates\nKeywords:\nTanoto Foundation\nTanoto Scholars Gathering\nSHARE\nURL berhasil di salin."

    "content": "Manila.\nJapan and the Philippines signed a key defense pact Monday allowing the deployment of Japanese forces for joint drills in the Southeast Asian nation that came under brutal Japanese occupation in World War II but is now building an alliance with Tokyo as both face an increasingly assertive China.\nThe Reciprocal Access Agreement, which similarly allows Filipino forces to enter Japan for joint combat training, was signed by Philippine Defense Secretary Gilberto Teodoro and Japanese Foreign Minister Yoko Kamikawa in a Manila ceremony witnessed by President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. It would take effect after ratification by the countries’ legislatures, Philippine and Japanese officials said.\nKamikawa called the signing of the defense agreement “a groundbreaking achievement\" that should further boost defense cooperation between the countries.\nThe Japanese and Philippine officials “expressed serious concern over the dangerous and escalatory actions by China” in Second Thomas Shoal, the scene of a recent confrontation between Chinese and Philippine forces in the South China Sea.\nAdvertisement\nThey underscored in a joint statement the need “for the international community to speak out on the importance of maintaining and strengthening the free and open international order based on the rule of law” in the disputed waters.\nThere was no immediate comment by Chinese officials.\nThe defense pact with the Philippines, which includes live-fire drills, is the first to be forged by Japan in Asia. Japan signed similar accords with Australia in 2022 and with Britain in 2023.\nUnder Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, Japan has taken steps to boost its security and defensive firepower, including a counterstrike capability that breaks from the country's postwar principle of focusing only on self-defense. It's doubling defense spending in a five-year period to 2027 in a move to bolster its military power and make Japan the world’s third-biggest military spender after the United States and China.\nMany of Japan’s Asian neighbors, including the Philippines, came under Japanese aggression until its defeat in World War II, and Tokyo's efforts to strengthen its military role and spending could be a sensitive issue. Japan and the Philippines, however, have steadily deepened defense and security ties.\nKishida’s moves dovetail with Marcos’ effort to forge security alliances to bolster the Philippine military’s limited ability to defend its territorial interests in the South China Sea. The busy sea passage is a key global trade route which has been claimed virtually in its entirety by China but also contested in part by the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan.\nThe United States has also been strengthening an arc of military alliances in the Indo-Pacific to better counter China, including in any future confrontation over Taiwan, and reassure its Asian allies. Japan and the Philippines are treaty allies of the US and their leaders held three-way talks in April at the White House, where President Biden renewed Washington’s “ironclad” commitment to defend Japan and the Philippines.\nJapan has had a longstanding territorial dispute with China over islands in the East China Sea. Chinese and Philippine coast guard and navy ships, meanwhile, have been involved in a series of tense confrontations in the South China Sea since last year.\nIn the worst confrontation so far, Chinese coast guard personnel armed with knives, spears and an ax aboard motorboats repeatedly rammed and destroyed two Philippine navy supply vessels on June 17 in a chaotic faceoff at disputed Second Thomas Shoal that injured several Filipino sailors. Chinese coast guard personnel seized seven navy rifles.\nThe Japanese and Philippine officials said China's actions at the shoal “obstructed freedom of navigation and disrupted supply lines, thus, increasing tensions.”\nKihara said in a news conference that Japan “has firmly opposed the dangerous and coercive use of maritime security agencies and maritime militia vessels.”\nThe Philippines strongly protested the Chinese coast guard’s actions and demanded $1 million for the damage and the return of the rifles. China accused the Philippines of instigating the violence, saying the Filipino sailors strayed into what it called Chinese territorial waters despite warnings.\nJapan and the United States were among the first to express alarm over the Chinese actions and call on Beijing to abide by international laws. Washington is obligated to defend the Philippines, its oldest treaty ally in Asia, if Filipino forces, ships and aircraft come under an armed attack, including in the South China Sea.\nTags:\n#International\nKeywords:\nJapan-Philippines relations\nJapan-Philippines Defense Pact\nSouth China Sea\nFerdinand Marcos Jr.\nYoko Kamikawa\nSHARE\nURL berhasil di salin."

    "content": "Jakarta.\nChemicals and infrastructure solutions firm Chandra Asri Pacific recently said that its business diversification could help boost the company’s financial performance.\nChandra Asri made the statement when the company hosted the Launchpad to Success event in Jakarta last week. The event -- which embraced the theme “A New Era of Industry: Building the Future through Transformation and Competency” -- sought to introduce Chandra Asri’s new identity to the public.\nThe company has made some changes. Chandra Asri has acquired a variety of infrastructure assets particularly those related to water, electricity, and port. This newly founded infrastructure business will support the company’s chemical sector. Not only will this be a financial boon for the business, the diversification also aligns with the company’s commitment to becoming a growth partner for Indonesia.\nAccording to Chandra Asri’s Legal and External Affairs Director Edi Riva’i, the diversification enables the company to provide a wider range of products. This will boost the company’s efficiency and productivity. The diversification will also help Chandra Asri be more competitive in the international market.\n“It aligns with our goal to become a growth partner for our stakeholders, be it the government, customers, investors, employees, and the general public,” Edi said.\nAs the company makes these changes, Chandra Asri is honing its employees’ skills through training. Chandra Asri’s human resource (HR) system has also undergone digital transformation. Edi added: “We also involve our employees in the transformation process so that they can get direct learning opportunities.”\nSuryandi, Chandra Asri’s Human Resources and Corporate Affairs Director, said that employees were pivotal to transforming a success. Employees are also key to enabling smooth business operations. He said: “That is why we allow our employees to grow and improve their competencies. So they can become part of the [company’s] growth.”\nPhilia Wibowo, who leads McKinsey’s People and Organizational Performance Practice in Southeast Asia, was also present during the conference. Philia shared what companies could do to develop their talents in today’s digital era.\n“Employees have to learn skills and competencies in depth. Some skills are increasingly important too. The ability to get along with people and orchestrate the stakeholders to achieve a goal is also important soft skills that we should have,” Philia said.\nCommitment to ESG and Sustainability\nChandra Asri Group hosts the 'Launchpad to Success: A New Era of Industry: Building the Future through Transformation and Competency' forum in Jakarta on June 27, 2024.

    "date": "2024-03-15 02:23:00",
    "content": "Ramallah, West Bank.\nPalestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has appointed his longtime economic adviser to be the next prime minister in the face of US pressure to reform the Palestinian Authority as part of Washington's postwar vision for Gaza.\nMohammad Mustafa, a US-educated economist and political independent, will head a technocratic government in the Israeli-occupied West Bank that could potentially administer Gaza ahead of eventual statehood. But those plans face major obstacles, including strong opposition from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and the Israel-Hamas war that is still grinding on with no end in sight.\nIt’s unclear whether the appointment of a new Cabinet led by a close Abbas ally would be sufficient to meet US demands for reform, as the 88-year-old president would remain in overall control.\n“The change that the United States of America and the countries of the region want is not necessarily the change that the Palestinian citizen wants,” said Hani al-Masri, a Palestinian political analyst. “People want a real change in politics, not a change in names ... They want elections.”\nAdvertisement\nHe said Mustafa is “a respected and educated man” but will struggle to meet public demands to improve conditions in the occupied West Bank, where Israeli restrictions imposed since the start of the war have caused an economic crisis.\nIn a statement announcing the appointment, Abbas asked Mustafa to put together plans to re-unify administration in the West Bank and Gaza, lead reforms in the government, security services and economy and fight corruption.\nMustafa was born in the West Bank town of Tulkarem in 1954 and earned a doctorate in business administration and economics from George Washington University. He has held senior positions at the World Bank and previously served as deputy prime minister and economy minister. He is currently the chairman of the Palestine Investment Fund.\nThe previous prime minister, Mohammad Shtayyeh, resigned along with his government last month, saying different arrangements were needed because of the “new reality in the Gaza Strip.”\nThe Palestinian Authority was established in the 1990s through interim peace agreements and was envisioned as a stepping-stone to eventual statehood.\nBut the peace talks repeatedly collapsed, most recently with Netanayahu’s return to power in 2009. Hamas seized power in Gaza from forces loyal to Abbas in 2007, confining his limited authority to major population centers that account for around 40 percent of the Israeli-occupied West Bank.\nAbbas is deeply unpopular among Palestinians, many of whom view the PA as little more than a subcontractor of the occupation because it cooperates with Israel on security matters. His mandate ended in 2009 but he has refused to hold elections, blaming Israeli restrictions. Hamas won a landslide victory in the last parliamentary elections, in 2006. Although it is considered a terrorist group by Israel and Western countries, Hamas would likely perform well in any free and fair vote.\nAbbas, unlike his Hamas rivals, recognizes Israel, has renounced armed struggle and is committed to a negotiated solution that would create an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel. That goal is shared by the international community.\nIsrael has long criticized the PA over payments it makes to the families of Palestinians who have been killed or imprisoned by Israel, including top militants who killed Israelis. The PA defends such payments as a form of social welfare for families harmed by the decades-old conflict.\nThe dispute has led Israel to suspend some of the taxes and customs duties it collects on behalf of the PA, contributing to years of budget shortfalls. The PA pays the salaries of tens of thousands of teachers, health workers and other civil servants.\nThe United States has called for a reformed PA to expand its writ to postwar Gaza ahead of the eventual creation of a Palestinian state in both territories. Netanyahu has ruled out any role for the PA in Gaza, and his government is opposed to Palestinian statehood.\nIsrael captured the West Bank, Gaza and east Jerusalem in the 1967 Mideast war. The Palestinians want all three territories to form their future state.\nIsrael annexed east Jerusalem in a move not recognized internationally and considers the entire city -- including major holy sites sacred to Jews, Christians and Muslims -- to be its undivided capital. Israel has built scores of settlements across the West Bank, where over 500,000 Jewish settlers live in close proximity to some 3 million Palestinians.\nIsrael withdrew soldiers and settlers from Gaza in 2005, but along with Egypt imposed a blockade on the territory when Hamas seized power two years later.\nNetanyahu has vowed to dismantle Hamas and maintain open-ended security control over Gaza in the wake of Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack, in which militants stormed into southern Israel, killing some 1,200 people and taking another 250 hostages. Israel’s subsequent invasion of Gaza has killed more than 31,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza health officials.\nThe Palestinian Authority has said it will not return to Gaza on the back of an Israeli tank, and that it would only assume control of the territory as part of a comprehensive solution to the conflict that includes statehood.\nTags:\n#International\nKeywords:\nWest Bank\nPalestinian Authority\nMahmoud Abbas\nMohammad Mustafa\nIsrael-Hamas War\nWar in Gaza\nHamas\nSHARE\nURL berhasil di salin."

    "date": "2024-01-15 13:52:00",
    "content": "Des Moines, Iowa.\nVoting is set to begin Monday night in icy Iowa as former US President Donald Trump eyes a victory that would send a resounding message that neither life-threatening cold nor life-changing legal trouble can slow his march toward the Republican Party's 2024 nomination.\nThe Iowa caucuses, which are the opening contest in the months-long Republican presidential primary process, begin at 8 p.m. EST. Caucus participants will gather inside more than 1,500 schools, churches and community centers to debate their options, in some cases for hours, before casting secret ballots.\nWhile Trump projects confidence, his onetime chief rival, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, is fighting for his political survival in a make-or-break race for second place. Former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley, the only woman in the race, stands in DeSantis' way. The two have competed aggressively in recent weeks to emerge as the clear alternative to the former president, who has alienated many Americans and could end up being a convicted felon by year’s end.\n\"I absolutely love a lot of the things (Trump) did, but his personality is just kind of getting in his way,” said Hans Rudin, a 49-year-old community college adviser from Council Bluffs, Iowa. He said he supported Trump in the past two elections, but will caucus for DeSantis on Monday.\nAdvertisement\nPolls suggest Trump enters the day with a massive lead in Iowa as Haley and DeSantis duel for a distant second. Entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy and former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson are also on the ballot, as is former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who suspended his campaign last week.\nWith the coldest temperatures in caucus history expected and dangerous travel conditions in virtually every corner of the rural state, the campaigns are bracing for a low-turnout contest that will test the strength of their support and their organizational muscle. The final result will serve as a powerful signal for the rest of the nomination fight to determine who will face Democratic President Joe Biden in the November general election.\nAfter Iowa, the Republican primary shifts to New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina over the coming weeks before moving into the rest of the country this spring. The ultimate nominee won't be confirmed until the party's national convention in July, but with big wins in the opening contests, Trump will be difficult to stop.\nTrump's political strength heading into the Iowa caucuses, which come 426 days after he launched his 2024 campaign, tells a remarkable story of a Republican Party unwilling or unable to move on from him. He lost to Biden in 2020 after fueling near-constant chaos while in the White House, culminating with his supporters carrying out a deadly attack on the US Capitol. In total, he faces 91 felony charges across four criminal cases, including two indictments for his efforts to overturn the election and a third indictment for keeping classified documents in his Florida home.\nIn recent weeks, Trump has increasingly echoed authoritarian leaders and framed his campaign as one of retribution. He has spoken openly about using the power of government to pursue his political enemies. He has repeatedly harnessed rhetoric once used by Adolf Hitler to argue that immigrants entering the US illegally are “poisoning the blood of our country. And he recently shared a word cloud last week to his social media account highlighting words like “revenge,” “power” and “dictatorship.”\nRepublican voters have been undeterred.\n“Trump is a Christian. He’s trustworthy. He believes in America. And he believes in freedom,” said 71-year-old Kathy DeAngelo, a retired hospital administrative employee waiting in subzero weather to see Trump on Sunday. “He's the only one.”\nThe final Des Moines Register/NBC News poll before the caucuses found Trump maintaining a formidable lead, supported by nearly half of likely caucusgoers, compared with 20 percent for Haley and 16 percent for DeSantis. Haley, the former U.N. ambassador and South Carolina governor, and DeSantis, the Florida governor, remain locked in a close battle for second. Trump is also viewed more favorably than the other top contenders by likely caucusgoers, at 69 percent compared with 58 percent for DeSantis and just 48 percent for Haley.\nOn the eve of the caucuses, Trump predicted he would set a modern-day record for an Iowa Republican caucus with a margin-of-victory exceeding the nearly 13 percentage points that Bob Dole earned in 1988. He also sought to downplay expectations that he would earn as much as 50 percent of the total vote.\nWhether he hits that number or not, his critics note that roughly half of the state’s Republican voters will likely vote for someone not named Trump.\n“Somebody won by 12 points and that was like a record. Well, we should do that,\" Trump said Sunday during an appearance at a Des Moines hotel. \"If we don’t do that, let 'em criticize us, right? But let’s see if we can get to 50 percent.“\n“Brave the weather and go out and save America,\" he later added.\nThe temperature in parts of Iowa on Monday could dip as low as negative 14 degrees Fahrenheit (negative 26 degrees Celsius) while snow drifts from Friday's blizzard still make travel hazardous across the rural state where unpaved roads are common.\nForecasters warned that “dangerously cold wind chills” as low as 45 degrees below zero Fahrenheit were possible through noon Tuesday. The conditions, according to the National Weather Service, could lead to “frost bite and hypothermia in a matter of minutes if not properly dressed for the conditions.”\nOver the weekend, signs positioned on key roadways warned motorists in large flashing orange letters: “TRAVEL NOT ADVISED.”\nAnd the winter weather, intimidating even for Iowa, will make an already unrepresentative process even less representative.\nMany elderly Iowans, who are the backbone of the caucus, are wondering how they will make it to their sites. And only a tiny portion of the participants will be voters of color, given Iowa's overwhelmingly white population, a fact that helped convince Democrats to shift their opening primary contest to South Carolina this year.\nIowa's caucuses are also playing out on Martin Luther King Day, which is a federal holiday.\nLast month, some presidential campaigns were expecting close to 200,000 Republican voters to participate in the caucus. On the eve of the contest, many now wonder whether the 2024 turnout will exceed the 118,411 Republicans who showed up in 2012.\nStill, each of the campaigns is claiming a powerful get-out-the-vote operation that will ensure their supporters show up.\nHaley rallied a room packed with Iowans and out-of-state volunteers on Sunday in Ames, drawing frequent cheers from the pink necklace and boa-clad “Women for Nikki.”\nThe 51-year-old former South Carolina governor repeated her frequent call for GOP voters to elect her as a “new generational leader that leaves the negativity and the baggage behind and focuses on the solutions of the future.”\nNearly 200 miles away in Dubuque, DeSantis dismissed questions about his position in the polls as he courted voters.\n“I like being underestimated. I like being the underdog,” the Florida governor said. “I think that that’s better.”\nMeanwhile, not all voters were excited about their options.\nJake Hutzell, 28, hasn’t participated in a caucus before, and he isn’t sure that he will Monday, either. He follows politics, but he said he’s part of a generation that’s skeptical any of it makes a difference.\n“There’s never been anyone I feel strongly about,” the Dubuque resident said. “If I’m going to throw my name behind who I think should be the president, I would like to very feel very strongly about it.”\nTags:\n#International\nKeywords:\nDonald Trump\nIowa Caucuses\nRepublican Primary\nRon DeSantis\nNikki Haley\nUS election\nSHARE\nURL berhasil di salin."

US&nbsp;President-elect Donald Trump's 2024 election victory is anticipated to bring significant economic implications for Indonesia due to expected shifts in American policy.&nbsp; Finance Minister Sri Mulyani addressed these potential changes during a state budget&nbsp;press conference at the Finance Ministry on Friday.\n“Many policies will change because Trump, as a Republican, has different priorities compared to President Joe Biden, who is a Democrat,” Sri Mulyani said.\nShe highlighted Trump's plans to reverse Biden's climate initiatives, including the Inflation Reduction Act. According to a recent analysis by Carbon Brief, under Trump, the US&nbsp;would likely see increased emissions through 2030, nearly matching the combined annual CO2 output of the European Union and Japan. Biden’s current climate goals aim for a 50-52 percent&nbsp;reduction in US&nbsp;greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 from 2005 levels, but under Trump, reductions might only reach about 28 percent below 2005 levels.\n“This shift will affect global oil prices and influence climate and energy trends in the future,” Sri Mulyani explained.\nAdvertisement\nIndonesia's oil and gas imports reached $28.5 billion in the January-September 2024 period, marking a 3.8 percent increase from&nbsp;the same period last year.&nbsp;\nAdditionally, she noted the continuation of the US-China&nbsp;trade war under Trump, who has pledged a blanket 60 percent&nbsp;tariff on all Chinese exports to the US.&nbsp;The US&nbsp;and China are Indonesia's largest trading partners.\n“Policy shifts like these will provoke market reactions, including corporate tax cuts, spending expansion, and tariff increases, especially in China.

The Jakarta Composite Index (JCI) opened in the red on Thursday, shedding 10.3 points (0.14 percent) to 7,373.5 following Donald Trump’s victory in the US&nbsp;presidential election. The index moved within a range of 7,329 to 7,386. On Wednesday, it had fallen sharply by 108.06 points (1.44 percent), closing at 7,383.8.\nIn early Thursday trading, 981.8 million shares were exchanged, generating Rp 815.3 billion in trade value over 54,210 transactions. Among the stocks, 157 gained, 191 declined, and 176 remained unchanged.\nAsian markets also faced volatility, mirroring investor caution. Japan’s Nikkei 225 dipped 0.6 percent&nbsp;to 39,246.86, South Korea’s Kospi lost 0.4 percent&nbsp;to 2,554.57, and Australia’s S&amp;P/ASX 200 slipped 0.1 percent&nbsp;to 8,191.00. Chinese stocks saw similar declines, with Hong Kong’s Hang Seng dropping 0.7 percent&nbsp;to 20,386.36 and the Shanghai Composite falling 0.7 percent&nbsp;to 3,359.99.\nAnalysts are watching for impacts from Trump’s “America First” economic stance, which has historically emphasized trade restrictions, especially with China. Mirae Asset Sekuritas Senior Market Analyst Nafan Aji Gusta warned, “Trump is likely to revive high tariffs on Chinese goods, imposing measures to strengthen the U.S. economy and limit China’s global influence.”\nAdvertisement\nNafan projected that tariffs could rise to as much as 60 percent&nbsp;on Chinese imports, potentially slowing down China’s economy and dampening global growth. Given China’s role in global supply chains, “a downturn there could create ripple effects for economies worldwide, including Indonesia,” he explained.\nThe US and China are Indonesia's largest trading partners.\nThere are also concerns about inflation in the US&nbsp;as higher tariffs drive up import prices. This could pressure the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates, making US&nbsp;assets more appealing to international investors.\n“A sustained rise in U.S. interest rates may redirect capital away from emerging markets like Indonesia, adding pressure to the JCI,” Nafan noted.\nElectoral counts as of Thursday morning showed Trump with 295 electoral votes, surpassing the 270 required to win the presidency, while Democratic candidate Kamala Harris received 226 electoral votes.\nUS&nbsp;markets rallied sharply on Wednesday amid expectations of pro-business policies under Trump’s administration.

    "content": "Jakarta\n.&nbsp;As the US presidential election on November 5 nears, analysts express a preference for Kamala Harris over Donald Trump, citing her economic policies as more conducive to stability and growth in global financial markets, particularly in Indonesia.\nHelmy Kristanto, an analyst at BRI Danareksa Sekuritas, said that the contrasting economic visions of the candidates&nbsp;could lead to significant shifts in US&nbsp;economic policy.\nTrump seeks to uphold the tax cuts from the Tax Cut and Jobs Act of 2017, proposing a reduction in the corporate tax rate to 15 percent&nbsp;and a 10 percent&nbsp;blanket tariff on imports, particularly targeting China. In contrast, Harris aims to alleviate costs for American families by maintaining tax cuts for those earning under $400,000, while raising the corporate tax rate to 28 percent&nbsp;and expanding tax credits to address income inequality.\nRecent polling suggests that a Republican sweep is the most likely outcome, with Trump potentially winning the presidency alongside a Republican-majority Congress. Other scenarios include a Harris victory with a Republican-controlled Congress, a Trump win with Democratic congressional control, or a less likely full Democratic sweep.\nAdvertisement\n\"A Republican sweep could prompt market reactions similar to those observed after the 2016 election, potentially leading to increases in US Treasury yields, a stronger dollar, and boosts to US&nbsp;equity markets. However, the effects may be tempered by pre-election market adjustments,\" Helmy said on Monday.\nRead More:\nA Presidential Campaign Unlike Any Other Ends on Tuesday -- Here's How We Got Here\nIncreased US&nbsp;Treasury yields&nbsp;could elevate Indonesian government bond yields, increasing debt servicing costs and limiting fiscal flexibility. \"This risk is heightened as Indonesia's government bond maturities peak in the next two years,\" he&nbsp;said.\nIn a divided government scenario, where one party controls the presidency and the other Congress, policy extremes may be moderated. For instance, Congress could temper Trump’s tariffs or Harris's corporate tax proposals. \"Nonetheless, both candidates' populist policies, such as tax cuts, pose a risk of widening the budget deficit without new revenue sources,\" he added.\nWhile a full Democratic sweep is considered unlikely, it could foster policy stability with more predictable fiscal measures, potentially supporting the current cycle of Federal Reserve rate cuts. According to Helmy, this stability may benefit emerging markets like Indonesia by providing a more stable yield environment for government bonds and the Indonesian rupiah.\n\"In the short term, a Republican sweep could lift US&nbsp;equity markets but might create volatility in Indonesia, particularly if Trump's policies pressure Indonesian exports, given that the US&nbsp;is Indonesia's largest trade surplus partner,\" he said, adding&nbsp;that broad tariffs could force Indonesian producers to lower prices to remain competitive.\nRead More:\nIDX Slips as Investors Turn Cautious Ahead of US Presidential Election\nConversely, a Democratic victory could lead to stability and predictability in US&nbsp;fiscal measures, benefiting emerging markets like Indonesia by supporting a stable inflation outlook and encouraging further Fed rate cuts, which may attract capital flows to Indonesia, where yields are comparatively higher.\nRegardless of the election outcome, geopolitical tensions and trade war risks are expected to persist. Both candidates support measures to contain China's influence, and tariffs are likely to continue.\n\"The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), introduced by Biden in 2022, which allows Chinese companies to establish manufacturing facilities in the US&nbsp;through joint ventures, remains contentious. Trump may allow the IRA to expire in 2025, while Harris might amend it to limit benefits for Chinese companies,\" Helmy explained.\nMyrdal Gunarto, a global markets economist at Maybank Indonesia, suggests that a Harris victory could lead to lower market volatility and sustained economic growth, aligning more closely with trends initiated by the Biden administration.\nHowever, Trump's programs aimed at reducing credit costs and promoting energy independence could result in lower oil prices. Yet, market concerns linger over Trump's fiscal expansion policies, protectionist stances on immigration, foreign goods, and electric vehicle policies.\n“From a business perspective, it seems that more people prefer Kamala Harris to win,” he told Investor Daily TV on Monday.\nPasardana economist Hans Kwee said that the stock market is adopting a \"wait and see\" approach ahead of the US&nbsp;election. He noted that each presidential candidate could significantly affect Indonesia's stock market movements.\n\"This year, the outcome is unpredictable, and there is a possibility of a Trump victory. If that happens, the Indonesian capital market may experience a correction. Therefore, market players are exercising caution,\" Kwee said.\nKwee further explained that market participants are closely monitoring the potential for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates. There is growing confidence that the Fed will reduce rates at the upcoming FOMC meeting in November, though the extent of the cut may not match September's reduction.\n\"The lingering question is whether a November cut will be followed by further reductions in December, which could be influenced by the election results,\" he added.\nTags:\n#Economy\nKeywords:\nKamala Harris\nDonald Trump\nUS election\nUS Election Impact on Indonesia\nSHARE\nURL berhasil di salin."

    "content": "Brussels.\nThe European Union is imposing duties on imports of electric vehicles from China starting Wednesday after talks between Brussels and Beijing failed to find an amicable solution to their trade dispute.\nElectric vehicles have become a major flashpoint in a broader trade dispute over the influence of Chinese government subsidies on European markets and Beijing’s burgeoning exports of green technology to the bloc.\n“By adopting these proportionate and targeted measures after a rigorous investigation, we’re standing up for fair market practices and for the European industrial base,” European Commission Executive Vice-President Valdis Dombrovskis said on Tuesday.\n“In parallel, we remain open to a possible alternative solution that would be effective in addressing the problems identified and (World Trade Organization)-compatible,” he added. The duties would stay in force for five years, unless an amicable solution is found.\nAdvertisement\nAccording to the commission, which manages trade disputes on behalf of the 27 EU member countries, sales of Chinese-built electric cars jumped from 3.9 percent of the EV market in 2020 to 25 percent by September 2023, in part by unfairly undercutting EU industry prices.\nThe duties on Chinese manufacturers will be 17 percent on cars made by BYD, 18.8 percent on those from Geely and 35.3 percent for vehicles exported by China’s state-owned SAIC. Geely has brands including Polestar and Sweden’s Volvo, while SAIC owns Britain’s MG, one of Europe’s bestselling EV brands.\nOther EV manufacturers in China, including Western companies such as Volkswagen and BMW, would be subject to duties of 20.7 percent. The commission has an “individually calculated” rate for Tesla of 7.8 percent.\nThe EU’s retaliatory duties have run into opposition in Germany, which has Europe’s biggest economy and is home to major automakers.\nThe head of Germany’s auto industry association, VDA, said the imposition of the tariffs is “a setback for free global trade and so for prosperity, the preservation of jobs and Europe’s growth.” Hildegard Müller said the move increases the risk of a far-reaching trade conflict.\n“The industry is not naive in dealing with China, but the challenges must be resolved in dialogue,” Müller said in a statement.\nThe measures were published in the bloc's legal Official Journal late Tuesday, meaning duties enter into force as of midnight, said EU spokeswoman Arianna Podesta.\nThe commission says China boosted its EU market share with the help of subsidies across the production chain. These ranged from cheap land for factories provided by local governments, to cut-price supplies of lithium and batteries from state-owned enterprises, to tax breaks and easy financing from state-controlled banks.\nThe rapid growth in China's market share has sparked concern in the EU that Chinese cars will eventually threaten the EU’s ability to produce its own green technology to combat climate change. Business groups and unions also fear that the jobs of 2.5 million auto industry workers could be put in jeopardy, as well those of 10.3 million more people whose employment depends indirectly on EV production.\nTags:\n#Automotive\nKeywords:\nChinese Electric Vehicles\nEU Duties on Chinese EVs\nEuropean Commission\nBYD\ngeely\nSHARE\nURL berhasil di salin."

    "content": "Brussels.\nNorth Korea has sent about 10,000 troops to Russia to train and fight in Ukraine within “the next several weeks,” the Pentagon said Monday, in a move that Western leaders say will intensify the almost three-year war and jolt relations in the Indo-Pacific region.\nSome of the North Korean soldiers have already moved closer to Ukraine, Pentagon spokeswoman Sabrina Singh said, and were believed to be heading for the Kursk border region, where Russia has been struggling to push back a Ukrainian incursion.\nEarlier Monday, NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte confirmed recent Ukrainian intelligence reports that some North Korean military units were already in the Kursk region.\nAdding thousands of North Korean soldiers to Europe’s biggest conflict since World War II will pile more pressure on Ukraine’s weary and overstretched army. It will also stoke geopolitical tensions in the Korean Peninsula and the wider Indo-Pacific region, including Japan and Australia, Western officials say.\nAdvertisement\nRussian President Vladimir Putin is keen to reshape global power dynamics. He sought to build a counterbalance to Western influence with a summit of BRICS countries, including the leaders of China and India, in Russia last week. He has sought direct help for the war from Iran, which has supplied drones, and North Korea, which has shipped large amounts of ammunition, according to Western governments.\nRutte told reporters in Brussels that the North Korean deployment represents “a significant escalation” in Pyongyang's involvement in the conflict and “a dangerous expansion of Russia’s war.”\nUS Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Secretary of State Antony Blinken will meet with their South Korean counterparts later this week in Washington.\nSingh said Austin and Defense Minister Kim Yong-hyun will discuss the deployment of North Korean soldiers in Ukraine. There will be no limitations on the use of U.S.-provided weapons on those forces, Singh said.\n“If we see DPRK troops moving in towards the front lines, they are co-belligerents in the war,” Singh said, using the acronym for the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, or North Korea. “This is a calculation that North Korea has to make.”\nRussia’s Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov shrugged off Rutte’s comments and noted that Pyongyang and Moscow signed a joint security pact last June. He stopped short of confirming North Korean soldiers were in Russia.\nLavrov claimed that Western military instructors long have been covertly deployed to Ukraine to help its military use long-range weapons provided by Western partners.\nUkraine, whose defenses are under severe Russian pressure in its eastern Donetsk region, could get more bleak news from next week’s US presidential election. A Donald Trump victory could see key US military help dwindle.\nIn Moscow, the Defense Ministry announced Monday that Russian troops have captured the Donetsk village of Tsukuryne -- the latest settlement to succumb to the slow-moving Russian onslaught.\nRutte spoke in Brussels after a high-level South Korean delegation, including top intelligence and military officials as well as senior diplomats, briefed the alliance’s 32 national ambassadors at NATO headquarters.\nRutte said NATO is “actively consulting within the alliance, with Ukraine, and with our Indo-Pacific partners,” on developments. He said he was due to talk soon with South Korea’s president and Ukraine’s defense minister.\n“We continue to monitor the situation closely,” he said. He did not take questions after the statement.\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, citing intelligence reports, claimed last Friday that North Korean troops would be on the battlefield within days.\nHe previously said his government had information that some 10,000 troops from North Korea were being readied to join Russian forces fighting against his country.\nDays before Zelensky spoke, American and South Korean officials said there was evidence North Korea had dispatched troops to Russia.\n&nbsp;\nTags:\n#International\nKeywords:\nNorth Korea Troops\nNorth Korea Troops in Russia\nRussia-Ukraine War\npentagon\nVolodymyr Zelensky\nRussia-North Korea Military Pact\nSHARE\nURL berhasil di salin."

    "content": "Kazan\n.&nbsp;Russian President Vladimir Putin hosted a BRICS summit on Wednesday, bringing together leaders from China, India, and other nations, as part of Russia’s efforts to counter Western global influence. Attendees included Chinese President Xi Jinping and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\n“The BRICS strategy in the global arena conforms with the strivings of the main part of the global community, the so-called global majority,” Putin said at the start of Wednesday's meeting. “This approach is especially relevant in the current conditions when truly radical changes are underway across the globe, including the shaping of a multipolar world.”\nThe agenda included strengthening financial cooperation, exploring alternatives to Western-controlled payment systems, resolving regional conflicts, and expanding the BRICS bloc, which now includes Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia, the UAE, and Saudi Arabia. Turkey, Azerbaijan, and Malaysia have applied for membership, and other nations have shown interest in joining.\nThe summit, held in Kazan, involved 36 countries, reflecting the limited impact of US-led attempts to isolate Russia over its involvement in Ukraine. The Kremlin described it as the largest foreign policy event it has ever hosted.\nAdvertisement\nRussia's push for a new payment system that could circumvent Western sanctions and replace the SWIFT network was a major focus. Putin accused the US&nbsp;of weaponizing the dollar, forcing Russia to seek alternatives. He proposed the creation of a BRICS investment platform to support economies of Global South and East countries.\n“It’s not us who refuse to use the dollar,” he said. “But if they don’t let us work, what can we do? We are forced to search for alternatives.”\nIn a joint declaration, summit participants voiced concern over \"unlawful unilateral coercive measures\" and pledged to enhance financial cooperation, supporting faster, more efficient, and inclusive cross-border payments.\nXi Jinping emphasized BRICS' role in global security and called for it to become a central channel for cooperation among Global South nations, advocating for reforms in global governance. He also highlighted a peace plan for Ukraine proposed by China and Brazil, though Ukraine has rejected the plan.\n“We must uphold the three key principles: no expansion of the battlefields, no escalation of hostilities, and no fanning flames and strive for swift deescalation of the situation,” Xi said of the Ukrainian conflict.\nModi echoed calls for dialogue and diplomacy, stressing that India supports peaceful resolutions rather than war. His visit marked his second to Russia in three months, underscoring India’s longstanding ties with Moscow.\n“We support dialogue and diplomacy, not war,” Modi said during Wednesday's BRICS meeting in remarks carried by the Indian foreign ministry.&nbsp;\n“As a diverse and inclusive platform, BRICS can play a positive role in all areas,” Modi said.\nPutin also held a meeting with Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian to strengthen relations between Russia and Iran, discussing plans for a strategic partnership treaty.\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres was set to meet Putin on Thursday, his first visit to Russia in over two years. The Ukrainian government criticized Guterres' trip, but the UN defended it as standard practice for engaging with major global organizations like BRICS.\nGuterres is expected to reaffirm his stance on the Ukraine war and push for the restoration of safe navigation in the Black Sea, essential for global food and energy security.\nTags:\n#International\nKeywords:\nVladimir Putin\nXi Jinping\nBRICS\nBRICS Summit\nUS Dollar\nSHARE\nURL berhasil di salin."

    "content": "Washington.\nThousands of copies of Donald Trump’s “God Bless the USA” Bible were printed in a country that the former president has repeatedly accused of stealing American jobs and engaging in unfair trade practices -- China.\nGlobal trade records reviewed by The Associated Press show a printing company in China’s eastern city of Hangzhou shipped close to 120,000 of the Bibles to the United States between early February and late March.\nThe estimated value of the three separate shipments was $342,000, or less than $3 per Bible, according to databases that use customs data to track exports and imports. The minimum price for the Trump-backed Bible is $59.99, putting the potential sales revenue at about $7 million.\nThe Trump Bible’s connection to China, which has not been previously reported, reveals a deep divide between the former president’s harsh anti-China rhetoric and his rush to cash in while campaigning.\nAdvertisement\nThe Trump campaign did not respond to emails and calls seeking comment.\nTrump Says His Bibles Would Help America\nThe largest and most recent load of 70,000 copies of Trump’s Bible arrived by container vessel at the Port of Los Angeles on March 28, two days after Trump announced in a video posted on his Truth Social platform that he’d partnered with country singer Lee Greenwood to hawk the Bibles.\nIn the video, Trump blended religion with his campaign message as he urged viewers to buy the Bible, inspired by Greenwood’s ballad, “God Bless the USA.” The Bible includes copies of the U.S. Constitution, Declaration of Independence, Bill of Rights and Pledge of Allegiance.\n“This Bible is a reminder that the biggest thing we have to bring back in America, and to make America great again, is our religion,\" Trump said. Judeo-Christian values, he added, are “under attack, perhaps as never before.”\nTrump didn’t say where the “God Bless the USA” Bibles are printed, or what they cost; a copy hand-signed by the former president sells for $1,000. Trump also didn't disclose how much he earns per sale.\nA version of the $59.99 Bible memorializes the July 13 assassination attempt on the former president in Pennsylvania. Trump’s name is on the cover above the phrase, “The Day God Intervened.” The wording appears to have been stamped on after the Bible was produced. Trump said Saturday his would-be assassin did not succeed “by the hand of providence and the grace of God.”\nThe Bibles are sold exclusively through a website that states it is not affiliated with any political campaign nor is it owned or controlled by Trump.\nA photo posted on the website shows Trump sitting at his desk in the Oval Office with Greenwood standing beside him. In another photo, the former president smiles broadly while holding a copy of the Bible.\nTrump's Name and Image Are Licensed\nThe website states that Trump’s name and image are used under a paid license from CIC Ventures, a company Trump reported owning in his most recent financial disclosure. CIC Ventures earned $300,000 in Bible sales royalties, according to the disclosure. It’s unclear what period that covers or how much Trump received in additional payments since the disclosure was released in August.\nAP received no response to questions sent to an email on the Bible website and to a publicist for Greenwood.\nFor years, Trump has castigated Beijing as an obstacle to America’s economic success, slapping hefty tariffs on Chinese imports while president and threatening even more stringent measures if he’s elected again. He blamed China for the COVID-19 outbreak and recently suggested, without evidence, that thousands of Chinese immigrants are flooding the US to build an “army” and attack America.\nBut Trump also has an eye on his personal finances. Pitching Bibles is one of a dizzying number of for-profit ventures he’s launched or promoted, including diamond-encrusted watches, sneakers, photo books, cryptocurrency and digital trading cards.\nThe web of enterprises has stoked conflict of interest concerns. Selling products at prices that exceed their value may be considered a campaign contribution, said Claire Finkelstein, founder of the nonpartisan Center for Ethics and the Rule of Law and a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania.\n“You have to assume that everything that the individual does is being done as a candidate and so that any money that flows through to him benefits him as a candidate,” Finkelstein said. “Suppose Vladimir Putin were to buy a Trump watch. Is that a campaign finance violation? I would think so.”\nSelling Bibles, she added, “strikes me as a profoundly problematic mixing of religion and state.”\nPotential Conflicts of Interest\nAs president, Trump would be in a position to influence policies and markets to benefit businesses in which he and his family have financial stakes. While president, his administration exempted Bibles and other religious texts from tariffs imposed on billions of dollars of Chinese goods.\nThere’s a potentially lucrative opportunity for Trump to sell 55,000 of the “God Bless the USA” Bibles to Oklahoma after the state’s top education official ordered public schools to incorporate Scripture into lessons for grades 5 through 12. Oklahoma plans to spend $3 million on Bibles that initially matched Trump’s edition: a King James Version that contains the US founding documents. The request was revised Monday to allow the US historical documents to be bound with the Bible or provided separately.\nOklahoma’s Department of Education did not answer AP’s questions about whether the Bibles must be printed in the United States or if any department officials have discussed the proposal with Trump or his representatives.\n“There are hundreds of Bible publishers and we expect a robust competition for this proposal,” said department spokesman Dan Isett.\nChinese Printing Company Confirms Shipments\nChina is one of the world’s leading producers of Bibles, so it’s not unusual for the Trump-endorsed version to be printed there.\nThe first delivery of Trump Bibles was labeled “God Bless USA,” according to the information from the Panjiva and Import Genius databases. The other two were described as “Bibles.” All the books were shipped by New Ade Cultural Media, a printing company in Hangzhou that describes itself as a “custom Bible book manufacturer.” They were sent to Freedom Park Design, a company in Alabama that databases identified as the importer of the Bibles.\nTammy Tang, a sales representative for New Ade, told AP all three shipments were “God Bless the USA” Bibles. She said New Ade received the orders via the WhatsApp messaging service and confirmed they were from Freedom Park Design. The books were printed on presses near the company’s Hangzhou office, she said. Tang did not disclose the sales price or other details, citing customer confidentiality.\n“They didn’t come to meet us,” Tang said by telephone. “We just do the production.”\nShe declined further comment and referred interview requests to Freedom Park Design.\nFreedom Park Design was incorporated in Florida on March 1, according to business registration records. An aspiring country singer named Jared Ashley is the company’s president. He also co-founded 16 Creative, a digital marketing firm that uses the same Gulf Shores address and processes online orders for branded merchandise sold by entertainers and authors.\nAshley hung up on a reporter who called to ask about the Bibles.\nGreenwood is a client of 16 Creative, according to the firm’s website. He launched the American-flag emblazoned Bible in 2021. His song, “God Bless the USA,” was released 40 years ago and is a staple at Trump rallies. Greenwood has also appeared at the former president’s campaign events.\nCritics Call Trump Bible a ‘Toxic Mix’\nThe King James Version used in the Trump Bible is in the public domain. Greenwood had initially planned to use the best-selling New International Version licensed in North America by HarperCollins Christian Publishing. But the publisher abandoned the arrangement amid pressure from religious scholars and authors who denounced the merger of Scripture and government documents as a “toxic mix” that would fuel Christian nationalism sentiments in evangelical churches.\nChristian nationalism is a movement that fuses American and Christian values, symbols and identity and seeks to privilege Christianity in public life. Christian nationalists are likely to believe the US Constitution was inspired by God and that the federal government should declare the US a Christian nation.\nOther critics called the Trump Bible blasphemous.\n“Taking what has long been understood as a global message religiously and stamping it with the flag of one nation is the type of thing that for centuries theologians would call heresy,” said Brian Kaylor, a Baptist minister and president of the Christian media company Word&amp;Way.\n‘Love of Money’\nTim Wildsmith, a Baptist minister who reviews Bibles on his YouTube channel, said he quickly noticed the signs of a cheaply made book when his “God Bless the USA” Bible arrived wrapped in plastic inside a padded mailer.\nThe front cover of the 'God Bless the USA' Bible in Washington, Tuesday, Oct. 8, 2024. (AP Photo/Ben Curtis)\nIt had a faux leather cover, and words were jammed together on the pages, making it hard to read. He also found sticky pages that ripped when pulled apart, and there was no copyright page or information about who printed the Bible, or where.\n“I was shocked by how poor the quality of it was,” Wildsmith said. “It says to me that it’s more about the love of money than it is the love of our country.”\nTags:\n#International\nKeywords:\nGod Bless the USA Bible\nDonald Trump\nBible Salesman\nUS presidential election\nSHARE\nURL berhasil di salin."

At the end of his 10-year tenure, President Joko \"Jokowi\" Widodo and President-elect Prabowo Subianto have approved the creation of a Cyber Force, which will become the fourth branch of the Indonesian Military (TNI), alongside the Army, Navy, and Air Force.\nAccording to Chief Security Minister Hadi Tjahjanto, the Cyber Force will operate similarly to other TNI branches by conducting patrols and mitigation efforts. \"The Cyber Force is a battle of minds. It's about how we can influence others and win the war,\" Hadi told reporters at the Parliament complex in Jakarta on Monday.\nHe stressed the importance of the Cyber Force, as future conflicts are expected to be cyber wars. \"A systematic approach is necessary to counter their attacks,\" he explained.\nHadi also reflected on Indonesia's past experiences with cyber warfare, particularly during the conflict with Timor Leste, which gained independence in 2002. He acknowledged that Indonesia still needs to build its cyber warfare expertise. “Cyber warfare requires media—information tools to shape public opinion. It’s a battle of minds, influencing people’s perceptions to achieve strategic goals,” he elaborated.\nAdvertisement\nGovernment Blames Weak Passwords for Taxpayer Data Breach\nDuring the 2024 Annual Session of the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR) in August, MPR Chairman Bambang Soesatyo (Bamsoet) highlighted that Indonesia's cybersecurity remains underdeveloped. According to the National Cyber Security Index, Indonesia ranks fifth in Southeast Asia, despite the global shift towards the internet of military things, where military operations are increasingly controlled remotely with greater speed and accuracy.\n“This is crucial, given Indonesia's vulnerable geopolitical position. We are directly facing the British Commonwealth nations: Malaysia, Singapore, and Australia, which are part of the Five Power Defence Arrangement (FFDA), alongside New Zealand and the United Kingdom. At the same time, we are also in the arena of geopolitical competition between Russia, China, and the United States,” Bamsoet concluded.\nCyber attacks on the government have become more frequent. On June 20, the Temporary National Data Center (PDNS) 2 in Surabaya was breached, disrupting critical government services, including immigration and school admissions.

    "content": "Jakarta.&nbsp;\nMany politicians, economists, and other domestic stakeholders have started to discuss the flagship economic policies of Prabowo’s administration.\nFrom having a high gross domestic product (GDP)&nbsp;growth target of up to 8 percent, self-sufficiency in food and energy, poverty eradication and re-industrialization, people have anticipated what Indonesia's economic development would be directed to.&nbsp;However, it is also important to start having an outlook on the country’s international affairs under Prabowo’s leadership.\nWhile we are still waiting for his official foreign policy signature after his inauguration in October 2024, the projection of how he would position Indonesia itself amidst the global dynamics might be useful. No one except him knows the decision at this stage.&nbsp;\nAs we know, \"changes\" are the most certain thing in the global economic and political situation, while uncertainties on how it would affect the world countries follow. The world is moving so rapidly, and often we can see many things evolve in only a few days.&nbsp;\nAdvertisement\nWhen many things might still continue its path, Indonesia under Prabowo’s time is expected to live within the changing global landscape. Before breaking down into some real cases of these shifting trends, we must understand two things:(1) Indonesia’s economy is significantly integrated into the regional and global ecosystem; (2) Prabowo’s economic narratives such as self-sufficiency will be highly inter-related to Indonesia’s foreign engagements. Thus, this writing is relevant.&nbsp;\nThe Revival of Global Economic Nationalism&nbsp;\nPrabowo will face the emerging risks of global economic nationalism, particularly those triggered by the continuous tension between the United States and China. The perceived sense of losing the economic competition by many major powers will also spark wider nationalistic-based policies. Recently, the imposed high tariffs for Chinese-made EVs are expected to provoke retaliation. Import restrictions, also often used by countries along with political-environmental reasonings, will intensify disruptions in the global supply chain.&nbsp;\nUnfortunately, countries are responding by becoming more protectionist of their domestic economy, invalidating its free trade commitments, disputing the disagreements, and further losing reciprocal confidence and trust. The world countries also try to diversify their partners and commodities, looking for alternative options and markets. However, the foreseen cost of this trend is an escalating global economic fragmentation.&nbsp;\nThe right narratives of Indonesia’s self-sufficiency in several sectors under Prabowo’s administration must be promoted, to ensure that it can go along without risking the existing economic partnerships. For instance, his vision of energy security regarded as pivotal to national defense will be instrumental for the next five years, but it must not neglect the importance of sustaining and expanding the scope and scale of foreign investments to our energy sector.&nbsp;\nThe Global Rebalancing of Power\nThe multipolar world tends to find a perfect tune of an ‘imperfect’ global order. While it sounds cliche, countries are asserting their influence to balance the existing world order. Realizing that the great powers’ rivalry is not a short-term period, many more states are positioning their path to take the most benefits out of the geopolitical contest.&nbsp;\nPresident-Elect Prabowo Subianto meets Russian President Vladimir Putin at the Grand Kremlin Palace on July 31, 2024. (Photo Courtesy of Defense Ministry)\nBRICS is now expanded as a grouping perceived to counter the West dominance and denunciation against the US-led world order. Just recently, Thailand and Malaysia lined up showing their intention to be part of BRICS with the narratives of proactively promoting multilateralism.&nbsp;\nBesides, some strategic economic tools flexed or involved by China also tried to push for Asia-centric geo-economic order, including the Belt and Road initiatives, Digital Silk Road and even RCEP. Indonesia under Prabowo is expected to well-navigate the country from this ongoing trend of global power restructuring or even play an active part in shaping the regional architecture, as in the Global South.&nbsp;\nThe Competition is Here: Southeast Asia\nPrabowo on many occasions has mentioned the \"Good Neighbor Policy\" as potentially the flagship foreign policy stance of his governance. Having less elaboration now, we may estimate his ultimate concerns on regional peace, stability, and solid cooperation as the key determinant of Indonesia’s growth.&nbsp;\nSoutheast Asia is indeed an extremely unique grouping. Member countries are committed to sharing their economic development despite significant dissimilarities. With different economic systems, all Southeast Asian states are committed to better integrating their institutional, physical, and digital connectivity.&nbsp;\nPresident-Elect Prabowo Subianto meets Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim in Malaysia on September 7, 2024. (Photo courtesy of the Defense Ministry)\nHowever, what is common in Southeast Asia today is its very vibrant economic competition. Vietnam with its rising manufacturing appetite and capabilities due to its more predictable policy governance, Malaysia with its stronger presence in the global technological value chain through its robust semiconductor industry and Singapore as a financial hub and aspires to be the renewable energy hub of Asia.&nbsp;\nIndonesia might have the opportunity in many sectors but has not identified its clear regional specialty. Prabowo is expected to review Indonesia’s competitive advantage in the midst of changing regional economic dynamism. Indonesia has to take optimal benefits from regional instruments such as the Digital Economy Framework Agreement (DEFA) and also the ASEAN Carbon Neutrality Strategy to map out key opportunities.&nbsp;\nInterestingly, we all see more active and assertive leaders in ASEAN as another boost for regional relevance to global growth, Prabowo is included. As much as foreign policy is decided by domestic policy imperatives, the global situation gives significant determination to the country’s position, and Prabowo will definitely take this not for granted.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n__\nNoto Suoneto is the&nbsp;VP for International Affairs at the&nbsp;Indonesian Business Council (IBC).&nbsp;The&nbsp;views expressed&nbsp;in this article are those of the&nbsp;author.\n&nbsp;\nTags:\n#Opinion\nKeywords:\nPrabowo Subianto\nPresident-Elect Prabowo Subianto\nAsean\nIndonesian diplomacy\nInternational Affairs\nforeign policy\nSHARE\nURL berhasil di salin."

    "content": "The US&nbsp;Presidential election is just around the corner, with only about two months remaining. However, many analysts continue to closely monitor political developments in the US&nbsp;to gauge their potential impact on global trade and the economy.\nOn Sept. 1, 538, a website managed by ABC News that focuses on analyzing national polls in politics, economics, and sports in the US, presented the latest data on the endorsement levels of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris.\nThe report showed Kamala Harris leading by 3.2 points over Donald Trump, with Harris at 47.1% and Trump at 43.8%. These figures are, of course, still subject to change, particularly in swing states such as Ohio, Florida, Virginia, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Iowa, and New Hampshire during this election season.\nKamala Harris's racial and gender background seems to influence her popularity among independent voters who are not affiliated with either the Democratic or Republican parties. As a result, the poll results may still shift depending on how Harris and Trump play their respective strategies. The recent withdrawal of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as an independent presidential candidate is expected to push his supporters to back Kamala Harris, particularly in New Mexico.\nAdvertisement\nIn the dynamics of the US. presidential election, right-wing conservative groups typically support free trade and globalization, while progressive left-wing groups seek protection for domestic industries. President Ronald Reagan's statement during his Thanksgiving address in 1988 is considered economic theology for Republicans. Reagan stated that one of the most important factors behind the prosperity of the American nation is an open trade policy that allows Americans to freely exchange goods and services with people from around the world.\nHowever, the era of Reagan's economic theology quickly ended with the emergence of Donald Trump, also from the Republican camp, as the 45th US. president from 2017 to 2021. Trump implemented two policies on a range of imported products, particularly from China: the first was Section 301 to address unfair trade practices, and the second was Section 232 to raise tariff walls on national security grounds. What is less known to the public is that Trump's protectionist policies, by raising tariffs, affected imports into the U.S. worth nearly $280 trillion and increased the final prices borne by American consumers by more than $51 trillion annually.\nThe Democratic administration under President Joe Biden, which took office in January 2021, has largely continued many of the trade policies pursued by former President Trump. Recently, President Biden also raised import tariffs on various products from China, amounting to a total of $18 trillion, on items ranging from electric vehicles to semiconductors and critical minerals needed by US&nbsp;industries.\nAdditionally, President Biden implemented an incentive-disincentive policy outlined in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). With this IRA, the US&nbsp;government offers tax subsidies worth $7,500 to citizens who purchase electric vehicles, provided that the minerals in the vehicle's batteries are mined, processed, or assembled in the U.S. or in countries with free trade agreements (FTAs) with the U.S. This is clearly a containment strategy to prevent China from freely accessing the highly lucrative U.S. consumer market, given that China produces about 79% of the world's lithium-ion battery needs for electric vehicles.\nIt is now clear that regardless of who the next US&nbsp;president is—whether from the Republican Party, traditionally known for its pro-free trade stance, or from the Democratic Party, which tends to champion protectionist agendas—the US&nbsp;will use high tariffs as one of its main trade instruments to protect and promote its economy in the coming years.\nDoes this mean the US&nbsp;will become increasingly \"isolationist\" in the global economic and trade arena?\nGenerally speaking, neither camp can be easily labeled as \"isolationist.\" However, the Republican camp, particularly under Donald Trump's leadership, has shown increasingly strong \"isolationist\" rhetoric, while the Democrats still emphasize diplomacy and international cooperation without fully abandoning the \"DNA\" of protectionism.\nRecently, both the Republican and Democratic camps have started making what are called happy-tariff promises. For example, Donald Trump recently asserted that if companies from other countries come and \"dump\" their products in the US&nbsp;market, they should pay a 10% tax (import duty). Even—perhaps jokingly—Trump stated that he would be happy to impose a 10% tax on all foreign goods entering the U.S.\nThis increasingly pro-tariff stance by the US&nbsp;will quickly spread to other countries, just as when the US&nbsp;and China imposed high tariffs on each other at the start of their trade dispute. Last week, for example, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced that starting Oct. 1, Canada will raise import tariffs on electric vehicles, steel, and aluminum from China by about 25%.\nEarlier, in June, the European Union (EU) announced its plan to impose additional import duties ranging from 17.4% to 38.1% on electric vehicles from China to match the selling prices of electric vehicles made in EU member countries. These additional import duties are on top of the current 10% import duty. It is reported that Beijing is preparing \"countermeasures\" against this EU plan, including raising import tariffs on several EU products so that the EU will face economic impacts comparable to what China will experience.\nBoth the US&nbsp;and the EU have long been \"trendsetters\" in trade liberalization and de-liberalization, which are followed, either openly or covertly, by other countries, particularly their allies. Perhaps there are justifications for the US&nbsp;and EU to raise tariffs on products from China, but this policy is not without risks.\nBeijing's support, both openly and covertly, in the form of subsidies to its industries and state-owned enterprises has long been criticized by its trading partners as highly unfair practices. Therefore, raising import tariffs to counterbalance this appears to be justified. However, as has happened, tariff hikes will be met with tariff hikes, and according to the CATO Institute's analysis, in the end, it is the consumers in each country that imposes high tariffs who will bear the brunt of rising prices, not the exporting countries or companies.\nThe world now faces a Hobson's choice: maintain jobs but face rising prices, declining productivity, and retaliation from other countries. However, the \"political gains\" from the actions and reactions between countries are real and serve as a stimulus for the growing rise of protectionism in many countries around the world.\nPerhaps it is time for Indonesia and fellow ASEAN countries to take more seriously the various regional trade frameworks such as the ASEAN Economic Community, the five ASEAN+1 FTAs (each with China, South Korea, Japan, and Australia-New Zealand), and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) (ASEAN, Australia, Japan, South Korea, China, and New Zealand). As a middle power, it is time for Indonesia to once again play a key role in strengthening economic, trade, and investment relations in this region because Indonesia cannot walk alone.\n---\nIman Pambagyo is a former director general of trade negotiations and an Indonesian ambassador in charge of the WTO.\nThe views expressed in this article are those of the author.\nTags:\n#Economy\nKeywords:\ntrade war\nimport tariffs\nKamala Harris\nDonald Trump\nUS election\nSHARE\nURL berhasil di salin."

    "content": "Beijing.\nChina on Sunday expressed its opposition to the latest US sanctions on Chinese companies over their alleged ties to Russia's war in Ukraine, saying it will adopt necessary measures to safeguard the rights and interests of the country's businesses.\nThe US on Friday announced sweeping sanctions on hundreds of firms in Russia and across Europe, Asia and the Middle East, accusing them of providing products and services that enable Russia’s war effort and aiding its ability to evade sanctions. The US Department of State said it was concerned by “the magnitude of dual-use goods exports” from China to Russia.\nThe Ministry of Commerce in China in its statement firmly opposed the US putting multiple Chinese companies on its export control list. The move bars such companies from trading with US firms without gaining a nearly unobtainable special license.\nThe ministry said the US action was “typical unilateral sanctions,\" saying they would disrupt global trade orders and rules, as well as affect the stability of the global industrial and supply chains.\nAdvertisement\n“China urges the US to immediately stop its wrong practices and will take necessary measures to resolutely safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies,” it said.\nThe US action is the latest in a series of thousands of US sanctions that have been imposed on Russian firms and their suppliers in other nations since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The effectiveness of the sanctions has been questioned, especially as Russia has continued to support its economy by selling oil and gas on international markets.\nAccording to the U.S. State Department, some China-based companies supplied machine tools and components to Russian companies.\nChina has tried to position itself as neutral in the Ukraine conflict, but it shares with Russia high animosity toward the West.\nAfter Western countries imposed heavy sanctions on Russian oil in response to Russia sending troops into Ukraine in February 2022, China strongly stepped up its purchase of Russian oil, increasing its influence in Russia. Russian President Vladimir Putin also underlined the importance of China by meeting in Beijing with Chinese leader Xi Jinping soon after being inaugurated for a fifth term in the Kremlin.\nTags:\n#International\nKeywords:\nChina-US trade war\nChina-US relations\nTrade sanctions\nRussia-Ukraine War\nSHARE\nURL berhasil di salin."

    "content": "Surveys conducted by research institutes, economic think tanks, and academia generally show that the world enters the second half of the year with a higher degree of optimism than seven months ago. However, continued geopolitical tensions, potential military conflicts in the Middle East, and the Federal Reserve's benchmark federal funds rate -- remaining at a 23-year high of between 5.25 percent and 5.5 percent -- may adversely affect trends in global trade in the latter half of 2024.\nAs of mid-2024, global trade has shown signs of recovery and growth, with significant contributions from emerging markets and specific sectors. In the first quarter of 2024, global trade in goods increased by around 1 percent, while trade in services grew by approximately 1.5 percent. This growth has been primarily fueled by positive trade dynamics in the United States and developing countries, particularly in sectors related to green energy and artificial intelligence.\nChina, India, and the US have seen notable increases in their exports, contributing to this positive trend. However, Europe's exports remained stagnant, and Africa experienced a decline in exports. Overall, if these positive trends continue, global trade in 2024 could reach nearly $32 trillion, though it is unlikely to surpass the record levels seen in 2022.\nEmerging markets have been playing an increasingly significant role in global trade. Countries such as China now account for a substantial share of global exports, driven by their competitive advantages in low-cost production and accommodative government policies. This shift has resulted in a higher proportion of unfinished goods, components, and services in global trade, which now make up 70 percent of all trade.\nAdvertisement\nDespite these positive trends, challenges remain, particularly in the trade of services. Services trade, which accounts for two-thirds of global GDP, has faced significant disruptions due to geopolitical tensions and protectionist policies. Political manipulation and non-tariff barriers continue to pose risks to the free flow of services across borders.\nWhile the short-term outlook for global trade in 2024 is cautiously optimistic, various economic, political, and environmental forces will continue to influence and reshape the global trade landscape. One such force is the ebb and flow of global stock markets.\nPanic in these markets can easily drag down global growth, and such panic may be caused by perceptions or sentiments of stock traders, not necessarily based entirely on objective calculations.\nA recent example occurred on August 5, 2024, when a global stock market sell-off intensified as traders became increasingly concerned that the US Federal Reserve was delaying interest rate cuts despite weak employment data. Meanwhile, the Bank of Japan appeared to be moving aggressively towards tighter monetary policy.\nEconomists have warned that fears of a global economic meltdown could become a reality if central banks fail to manage the consequences effectively. This scenario has occurred before and could happen again, especially as investors note the fragile recovery of global trade due to slower growth in China and the European Union, along with the potential for conflict in the Middle East.\nThe primary concern now is that continued market volatility could undermine business confidence and tighten credit conditions, impacting both developed and emerging economies beyond the US. If unchecked, a sudden shock to confidence could spill over into the real economy, potentially making these fears a self-fulfilling prophecy.\nGiven these circumstances, the trade prospects for Indonesia in the second half of 2024 appear “cautiously optimistic.” Several key factors will influence its trajectory. Indonesia's economy is expected to grow by around 5.0 percent in 2024, supported by robust domestic demand and a stable macroeconomic environment. This positive outlook persists despite external challenges, such as softer commodity prices and global economic uncertainties.\nIndonesia's export performance is projected to remain strong, particularly in sectors such as electronics, automotive, and processed food. However, the decline in commodity prices, especially for palm oil and coal, may dampen overall export revenues.\n&nbsp;\nIndonesia’s Exports and Imports 2019 – May 2024 (in US$ million)\nTrade\n2019\n2020\n2021\n2022\n2023\nMay 2024\nTotal Exports\n167,683.0\n163,191.8\n231,609.5\n291,904.3\n258,774.4\n104,246.6\nOil &amp; Gas\n11,789.3\n8,251.1\n12,247.4\n15,998.2\n15,921.9\n6,668.8\nNon-Oil &amp; Gas\n155,893.7\n154,940.8\n219,362.1\n275,906.1\n242,852.5\n97,577.8\nTotal Imports\n171,275.7\n141,568.8\n196,190.0\n237,447.1\n221,886.2\n91,190.9\nOil &amp; Gas\n21,885.3\n14,256.8\n25,529.1\n40,416.4\n35,830.5\n14,736.9\nNon-Oil &amp; Gas\n149,390.4\n127,312.0\n170,660.9\n197,030.7\n186,055.8\n76,454.1\nTotal Balance\n-3,592.7\n21,623.0\n35,419.5\n54,457.2\n36,888.2\n13,055.7\n&nbsp;\nIndonesia is focusing on diversifying its export markets and products to reduce dependency on traditional commodities. The country should maximize regional trade agreements, such as ASEAN and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), as they could facilitate greater market access and integration into global value chains.\nIn parallel, continued structural reforms aimed at improving the business environment, such as enhancing infrastructure, reducing regulatory burdens, and promoting digital transformation, are expected to attract more foreign direct investment (FDI). This, in turn, will bolster export capacity and competitiveness.\nPotential risks to Indonesia’s export performance include geopolitical tensions, fluctuations in global commodity markets, and the impact of global economic slowdowns on demand for Indonesian exports. Additionally, the ongoing adaptation to new environmental regulations, particularly in key markets like the European Union, poses challenges for traditional export sectors like palm oil.\nOverall, while Indonesia's trade prospects for the second half of 2024 are promising, they will heavily depend on global economic conditions, the effectiveness of domestic policies, and the country's ability to navigate external shocks and leverage trade agreements for economic growth.\n---\nIman Pambagyo is a former director general of trade negotiations and an Indonesian ambassador in charge of the WTO.\nThe views expressed in this article are those of the author.\nTags:\n#Trade\nKeywords:\nglobal trade\nEconomic Outlook\nSHARE\nURL berhasil di salin."

    "content": "Global trade continues to grapple with geopolitical tensions and geo-economic fragmentation as we progress into the second half of 2024. Most economists around the world anticipate these tensions will escalate, leading to greater volatility in international trade and affecting the overall global economic outlook for this year and the next. The fragmentation of global trade is expected to result in increased localization and a widening gap between the Global North and South.\nAgainst this backdrop, a report by the World Trade Organization’s Secretariat, published on July 8, 2024, offers a thought-provoking overview of trade and trade-related developments in goods from mid-October 2023 to mid-May 2024. According to the report, WTO members introduced more trade-facilitating measures (169) than trade-restricting ones (99) during the review period.\nMost of these measures were on the import side, with a decline in new export restrictions, reversing the trend seen in 2021 and 2023, when new import restrictions outnumbered new export restrictions. This signals WTO members' commitment to maintaining the flow of trade, suggesting that globalization persists, albeit in a different configuration.\nThe report also revealed an increase in the average monthly number of trade remedy initiations from 17 (mid-October 2022 to mid-October 2023) to 25, with nearly 90 percent introduced by G20 members. Meanwhile, the monthly average of trade remedy terminations decreased from 11 to only five.\nAdvertisement\nThis could be seen as a positive development, as more WTO members resort to 'conventional' methods to address surges in imports and unfair trade practices through trade instruments allowed under WTO agreements, rather than taking unilateral actions. This aligns with the efforts of WTO Director-General, Ambassador Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, to rejuvenate the multilateral trading system and encourage member states to 'walk the talk.'\nHowever, the proliferation of trade remedy initiations may further fragment global trade, exacerbating challenges in an already struggling global economy facing climate change, high commodity prices, inflation, and rising shipping costs.\nThe global economic outlook for the second half of 2024 shows divergent regional growth patterns. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) projects a slight decline in global growth from 3 percent in 2023 to 2.9 percent this year. In contrast, the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) is cautiously optimistic, predicting around 3 percent growth due to positive trade trends in the first quarter of 2024.\nThis growth is primarily driven by emerging markets, while advanced economies are expected to experience slower growth. Inflation expectations have been lowered across all regions, and financial conditions are anticipated to ease over the year.\nHowever, growth forecasts for regions like Europe and the Middle East have weakened considerably, while South and East Asia are expected to maintain robust economic activity, despite lower growth expectations for China.\nAdditionally, the advancement of generative AI is poised to significantly impact the global economy, potentially disrupting various sectors and accelerating technological adoption more rapidly than past advancements. Consequently, China may continue to boost its AI capacity to offset potential downturns in some sectors due to domestic and international challenges, though this could hypothetically increase China's unemployment rate.\nOverall, most economists agree that the biggest potential risks to global economic growth will stem from geopolitical instability and conflicts, followed by transitions in political leadership in countries with regional and international influence, inflation, changes in trade policy, and a slowdown in China’s economic activity.\nSouth-South trade is expected to set the pace in terms of both exports and imports, while developed countries will likely see flat imports and a modest rise in exports.\n---\nIman Pambagyo is a former director general of trade negotiations and an Indonesian ambassador in charge of the WTO.\nThe views expressed in this article are those of the author.\n&nbsp;\nTags:\n#Economy\nSHARE\nURL berhasil di salin."

    "content": "New Delhi.\nFresh from declaring victory in India's election, Prime Minister Narendra Modi offered few details on the agenda for his third term, but went out of his way to underline he would continue to focus on raising the country's military preparedness and clout.\nThat should come as good news to the United States and its other allies, as they focus increasingly on keeping China’s sweeping maritime claims and growingly assertive behavior in the Indo-Pacific region in check.\n“The government will focus on expanding defense production and exports,” Modi told a crowd of supporters at his party's headquarters after election results came in. He spoke of his plan to increase security by lowering India's dependence on arms imports. “We will not stop until the defense sector becomes self-sufficient.”\nDefense cooperation with the US has greatly expanded under Modi, particularly through the so-called Quad security grouping that also includes Australia and Japan.\nAdvertisement\nIt’s a two-way street, giving the US a strong partner neighboring China, which Washington has called its “pacing challenge,” while strengthening India’s defense credibility against a far more powerful rival.\n“India is currently a frontline state as far as the Americans are concerned,” said Rahul Bedi, a New Delhi-based defense analyst. “The Indian navy is a major player in the Indian Ocean region.”\nThe defense relationship was also at the top of US President Joe Biden's agenda when he congratulated Modi on the election results.\nIn a call, “the two leaders emphasized their deepening the U.S.-India comprehensive and global strategic partnership and to advancing their shared vision of a free, open and prosperous Indo-Pacific region,” the White House said.\nIt added that National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan would soon travel to New Delhi “to engage the new government on shared U.S.-India priorities.”\nIt was about a year into Modi's second term when India's defense focus took a sharp turn toward China, when troops from the two nuclear neighbors clashed in 2020 in the Galwan Valley in the disputed northern border region of Ladakh and 20 Indian soldiers were killed.\n“China really is India's long term strategic challenge, both on the border and in the Indian Ocean as well,” said Viraj Solanki, a London-based expert with the International Institute for Strategic Studies.\n“This has resulted in a number of defense partnerships by India shifting, or just focusing on countering China's growing influence in the Indo-Pacific region,” he said.\nBeijing has a close relationship with Pakistan, India's traditional rival, and China has been increasing defense cooperation with India's neighbors, including Nepal and Bangladesh, as well as the Maldives and Sri Lanka.\n“China is really trying to engage more with these countries and develop its own influence and presence,” Solanki said. “I think that is a concern for New Delhi and something that will lead to increased competition in the Indian Ocean over the next few years.”\nIn congratulating Modi on the election results, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said that a “sound and stable ” relationship between India and China was “in the interest of both countries and conducive to the peace and development of the region.\"\nShe also added that China stood “ready to work with India,” but her comments were significantly more muted than the Foreign Ministry's remarks on Modi's last win in 2019 -- before the border fight. At that time, the Foreign Ministry called the two nations “important neighbors” and said China wanted to \"deepen political mutual trust, carry out mutually beneficial cooperation and push forward the closer partnership between the two countries.”\nModi has always governed with his party in the majority, but after a lackluster performance in the election will now be forced to rely on coalition partners, and will face a stronger and invigorated opposition.\nThe main opposition Congress party is unlikely to challenge Modi's defense reforms, but has been critical of how he has handled the border issue with China and may pressure him on that front, Bedi said.\n“Modi has not been entirely truthful, or very economical with the truth as far as the situation in Ladakh is concerned,” he said. He referred to a Defense Ministry document that was published online, and quickly removed, which had suggested Chinese troops entered Indian territory during the 2020 confrontation.\n“The opposition, I am sure, will raise questions and ask the government to come clean on what the real situation is.”\nUnder Modi's program of military modernization and reform, his government has sought to grow the private defense manufacturing sector, a space previously occupied solely by the government-run organizations, and has eased foreign direct investment regulations to try and encourage companies to establish themselves in India.\nIn a flagship project, the country launched its first home-built aircraft carrier in 2022, part of a plan to deploy two carrier battle groups to counter China’s rising maritime power.\nMuch of India's military equipment is of Russian origin, and delays on delivery and difficulties of procuring spare parts due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine has also provided impetus for India to diversify defense procurement, looking more to the US, France, Israel and elsewhere, Solanki said.\nAs it seeks to strengthen ties with India, Washington has agreed to a deal that will allow General Electric to collaborate with Hindustan Aeronautics to produce fighter jet engines.\nSpeaking at the Shangri-La defense conference in Singapore last weekend, US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said the countries were also co-producing armored vehicles.\n“The relationship that we enjoy with India right now is as good or better than our relationship has ever been,” he said. “It's really strong.”\nTags:\n#International\nKeywords:\nNarendra Modi\nIndia-China relations\nIndia-US relations\nGalwan Valley\nSHARE\nURL berhasil di salin."

    "content": "As Indonesians start to move on from the presidential election process and await the installment of a Prabowo-led government, the nation is at a crossroads with its energy blueprint. Some noted issues include oil production steadily decreasing, renewable integration targets for 2025 having been reduced from 23 to 17 percent, and foreign investment still below expectations. What’s fascinating is, that an economically pragmatic policy to improve the energy situation could secure unprecedented post-reformation political power for the next administration. A possibility which, understandably, may not yet be fathomed at the current moment.&nbsp;\nNevertheless, Indonesia is due for an economic leap via energy growth after years of slow and underachieving economic progress. Energy consumption per capita, directly correlated to economic growth, has increased only 80 percent from 2002-2022. Larger growth surges, still not experienced in Indonesia, have transformed China and are currently ongoing in countries like Vietnam (nearly a 500 % increase in energy consumption per capita from 2002-2022).&nbsp;\nThe new Indonesian leadership will be presented with a dichotomy of choice: a short-term goal to maximize or a long-term vision for perpetual influence. If the new regime chooses the latter, it will be akin to the route taken by the Chinese at the turn of the 21st century. Energy consumption per capita rose 400 percent from 2000-2022 in China. It was a phenomenon that was based on Deng Xiaoping’s free market economy implementation and later utilized as a springboard for Xi Jinping’s power grab soon after his ascent.\nAlthough Jinping consolidated power through an aggressive anti-corruption campaign and the invigoration of a floundering Chinese national pride, the foundation of his rule was the unleashing of aggressive industrial policies. These aims successfully established China as the global manufacturing superpower pillared by coal power generation. In turn, China enjoyed record growth trajectories, eradicated poverty (reduced from 26 percent&nbsp;to &nbsp;1 percent), and cemented Jinping as its most powerful ruler since Mao Zedong.\nAdvertisement\nSimilarly, Jokowi attempted this very tactic at the outset of his presidency by ramping up coal-generated power. While the supply side of the energy was increased, the demand for such energy generation was not created aptly via industrialization due to damaging bureaucratic delays leading to energy oversupply.&nbsp;\nThe two countries’ predicaments at their fork-in-the-road moments are not identical, so varying approaches are necessary. Nevertheless, Indonesia has a chance to shift its energy philosophy to fully realize its imminent rise. &nbsp;A lack of a true understanding of energy principles by the populace enables policies to be executed in any direction. It can then be justified by numerous pundits at the government’s disposal, with little to no consequence. A harrowing reality yet a situation that could ironically be leveraged for useful purposes.\nWorld history has shown, that policies in energy are often used as political tools to reach a specific goal. One such objective is garnering power by lifting a country’s financial standing into new territories. The coming leadership’s narrower power structure should aid in swifter policy execution.\nSo, what are these energy philosophies for Indonesia to solidify power as a country, a geopolitical entity, and its government?\nEliminate the desire to placate too many viewpoints for the energy transition and focus predominantly on cost and benefits. Emphasis on just the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions is not effective as this one-dimensional tactic could hamper the country economically. Currently, Indonesia is not in any position to sacrifice significant economic growth solely to satisfy an environmental target. It ideally needs to grow while limiting emissions, but if only one option could be achieved, select the economic path.\nClimate policy, as renowned professor Roger Pielke Jr. succinctly described is governed by the Iron Law: “When climate policies focused on economic growth confront policies focused on emissions reduction, it is economic growth that will win out (nearly) every time”. For a country like Indonesia whose economic threshold is lower than the more developed OECD countries, the iron policy should reign supreme. &nbsp;\nNext, the government should grant greater freedom to its energy asset holders both private and state-owned enterprises (SOE) to innovate, experiment and create. This can be accomplished by a more favorable investment term and a more lenient permit process. The United States is the world leader in innovation partly due to an embedded national philosophy of absolute property rights still valid today. Once an entity owns a plot of land, it is free to take the most profitable route as it sees fit above and underground.&nbsp;\nIn 1870, Bryon Benson an oil distribution entrepreneur built a 130-mile pipeline in three months, a literal pipe dream today. Another example is the shale gas/oil boom that started in 2008 that transformed the global hydrocarbon landscape. US shale companies cut fracking costs by more than 100 percent in a three-year span and astonishingly undercut Saudi oil prices. This was achieved through creative process innovations made feasible by flexible regulations.\nIndonesia does not adhere to the US land ownership law, yet the government should still emulate similar principles that could liberate the energy industry. Each nationalized oil block acquired by Pertamina had a marked decrease in production (Rokan from Chevron and Mahakam from Total). It is not a case of incapable human resources, as the national oil company has a plethora of great minds and leaders. The legal framework and a lack of collective synergy are the main culprits.\nOne way to combat this is through direct incentives of the public sector that could be applied not only to fossil fuel companies but also to renewable players. As Robert Greene, the best-selling author of 48 Laws of Power, asserted, it is best to cater to man’s self-interest rather than appeal to him for a greater good to accomplish an objective.&nbsp;\nSOE employees need to be financially incentivized when exceeding expectations in performance or delivering profitable projects. Some studies showed that cash incentives have raised revenues by as much as 20 percent while cutting costs by nearly 10 percent boosting company profitability. SOE staff also fear criminalization for making decisions deemed erroneous. It simply must change. A narrow and more unilateral path of power in governance could make a world of a difference.\nNow we await the confirmation of the new president, yet one fact still remains. Prosperity and power will only come via energy development regardless of which man is in charge. For most Indonesians, it is no matter if the cat is black or white, as long as it succeeds in killing the rat.\n-----\nRizvi Shihab is an oil and gas professional and founder of Enerprogroup.\nThe views expressed in the article are those of the author.\nTags:\n#Energy &amp; Minerals\nKeywords:\nPrabowo Cabinet\nRenewable energy transition\nenergy consumption\nSHARE\nURL berhasil di salin."

    "content": "Washington.\nUS President Joe Biden and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping discussed Taiwan, artificial intelligence and security issues Tuesday in a call meant to demonstrate a return to regular leader-to-leader dialogue between the two powers.\nThe call, described by the White House as “candid and constructive,” was the leaders’ first conversation since their November summit in California produced renewed ties between the two nations’ militaries and a promise of enhanced cooperation on stemming the flow of deadly fentanyl and its precursors from China.\nXi told Biden that the two countries should adhere to the bottom line of “no clash, no confrontation” as one of the principles for this year.\n“We should prioritize stability, not provoke troubles, not cross lines but maintain the overall stability of China-US relations,” Xi said, according to China Central Television, the state broadcaster.\nAdvertisement\nThe roughly 105-minute call kicks off several weeks of high-level engagements between the two countries, with Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen set to travel to China on Thursday and Secretary of State Antony Blinken to follow in the weeks ahead.\nBiden has pressed for sustained interactions at all levels of government, believing it is key to keeping competition between the two massive economies and nuclear-armed powers from escalating to direct conflict. While in-person summits take place perhaps once a year, officials said, both Washington and Beijing recognize the value of more frequent engagements between the leaders.\nThe two leaders discussed Taiwan ahead of next month’s inauguration of Lai Ching-te, the island’s president-elect, who has vowed to safeguard its de-facto independence from China and further align it with other democracies. Biden reaffirmed the United States’ longstanding “One China” policy and reiterated that the US opposes any coercive means to bring Taiwan under Beijing’s control. China considers Taiwan a domestic matter and has vigorously protested US support for the island.\nTaiwan remains the “first red line not to be crossed,” Xi told Biden, and emphasized that Beijing will not tolerate separatist activities by Taiwan’s independence forces as well as “exterior indulgence and support,” which alluded to Washington’s support for the island.\nBiden also raised concerns about China’s operations in the South China Sea, including efforts last month to impede the Philippines, which the US is treaty-obligated to defend, from resupplying its forces on the disputed Second Thomas Shoal.\nNext week, Biden will host Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida at the White House for a joint summit where China’s influence in the region was set to be top of the agenda.\nBiden, in the call with Xi, pressed China to do more to meet its commitments to halt the flow of illegal narcotics and to schedule additional precursor chemicals to prevent their export. The pledge was made at the leaders’ summit held in Woodside, California, last year on the margins of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting.\nAt the November summit, Biden and Xi also agreed that their governments would hold formal talks on the promises and risks of advanced artificial intelligence, which are set to take place in the coming weeks. The pair touched on the issue on Tuesday just two weeks after China and the US joined more than 120 other nations in backing a resolution at the United Nations calling for global safeguards around the emerging technology.\nBiden, in the call, reinforced warnings to Xi against interfering in the 2024 elections in the US as well as against continued malicious cyberattacks against critical American infrastructure.\nHe also raised concerns about human rights in China, including Hong Kong’s new restrictive national security law and its treatment of minority groups, and he raised the plight of Americans detained in or barred from leaving China.\nThe Democratic president also pressed China over its defense relationship with Russia, which is seeking to rebuild its industrial base as it presses forward with its invasion of Ukraine. And he called on Beijing to wield its influence over North Korea to rein in the isolated and erratic nuclear power.\nAs the leaders of the world’s two largest economies, Biden also raised concerns with Xi over China’s “unfair economic practices,” National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said, and reasserted that the US would take steps to preserve its security and economic interests, including by continuing to limit the transfer of some advanced technology to China.\nXi complained that the US has taken more measures to suppress China’s economy, trade and technology in the past several months and that the list of sanctioned Chinese companies has become ever longer, which is “not de-risking but creating risks,” according to the broadcaster.\nTags:\n#International\nKeywords:\nUS-China relations\nJoe Biden\nXi Jinping\nTaiwan Issue\nOne China policy\nSHARE\nURL berhasil di salin."

    "content": "Srinagar, India.\nFor decades, India has focused its defense policy on its land borders with rivals Pakistan and China. Now, as its global ambitions expand, it is beginning to flex its naval power in international waters, including anti-piracy patrols and a widely publicized deployment close to the Red Sea to help protect ships from attacks during Israel’s war with Hamas.\nIndia sent three guided missile destroyers and reconnaissance aircraft in November when Yemen-based Houthi rebels began targeting ships in solidarity with Hamas, causing disruptions in a key trading route that handles about 12 percent of global trade.\nThe deployment highlights the country as a “proactive contributor” to international maritime stability, said Vice Adm. Anil Kumar Chawla, who retired in 2021 as head of India’s southern naval command.\n“We are not doing it only out of altruism. Unless you are a maritime power you can never aspire to be a global power,” Chawla said. India, already a regional power, is positioning itself “as a global player today, an upcoming global power,” he said.\nAdvertisement\nIndia is widely publicizing the deployments, signaling its desire to assume a wider responsibility in maritime security to the world and its growing maritime ambitions to regional rival China.\n“It is a message to China that, look, we can deploy such a large force here. This is our backyard. Though we don’t own it, but we are probably the most capable and responsible resident naval power,” Chawla said.\nThe Indian Navy has helped at least four ships, three of which were attacked by Houthi rebels and another that Washington blamed on Iran, a charge denied by Tehran. It has also conducted several anti-piracy missions.\nIran-backed Houthi rebels have targeted dozens of ships in the Red Sea, saying they are seeking a cease-fire in the Gaza Strip. The US and its allies have responded with multiple rounds of bombings of rebel positions. India has not joined the US-led force battling the Houthis.\nOn Jan. 26, the Indian guided missile destroyer INS Visakhapatnam assisted the crew of a Marshall Islands-flagged tanker in fighting a fire after it was hit by a missile in the Gulf of Aden. About 10 days earlier, the Visakhapatnam responded to a distress call by the US-owned Genco Picardy merchant vessel following a drone attack in the same waters.\n“Maritime security has not been a strong pillar of India’s foreign policy engagements in a way we are beginning to see now,” said Darshana M. Baruah, a fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. “China is a factor in this.”\nThe rivals are already locked in a military standoff along their disputed border high in the mountains.\nChina has built up its presence over the years in the Indian Ocean, a key route for its energy supplies. It has the world’s largest navy by number of ships, more than three times the size of the Indian navy. China also operates a powerful fleet of large coast guard ships and what is referred to as its maritime militia consisting of fishing vessels that cooperate with the coast guard in asserting territorial claims in the South China Sea.\nBeijing has deepened its engagement in the Indian Ocean mainly through infrastructure deals with India’s neighbors, including Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and most recently the Maldives.\n“The Chinese are looking for more and more naval bases in the extended Indian Ocean,” said Lt. Gen. D. S. Hooda, a former Indian military officer and now a strategic expert. “Seeing that, India doesn’t have any other option but to keep building up its own.”\nThe Maldives government last week gave clearance to a Chinese research ship to dock in its port. Similar Chinese ships have made port calls in Sri Lanka in 2022 and 2023 amid fears in India that they could be used to surveil the region. India's concerns led Sri Lanka earlier this year to declare a one-year moratorium on foreign research ships entering its waters.\nFILE- In this photo released by Defense Visual Information Distribution Service, ships from Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force and Indian Navy sail in formation with Royal Australian Navy HMAS Warramunga and Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer USS Barry (DDG 52) during MALABAR 2021 on Aug. 27, 2021. (Justin Stack/DVIDS U.S. Navy via AP)\nExperts say the growing competition with China is energizing India to acquire more advanced ships, submarines and aircraft and invest more in technology and infrastructure. The navy’s share of India’s burgeoning defense budget, which reached $72.6 billion last year, has increased to 19 percent from about 14 percent. The Indian army has traditionally received the lion’s share of the military budget.\nThe navy has also built strategic partnerships through participation in joint exercises with other nations in the region and beyond.\nBaruah, who directs the Indian Ocean Initiative at the Carnegie Endowment, said there is a “need for Delhi’s strategic thinking to be maritime-oriented, not just as an option for crisis response but as a theater to advance India’s most pressing geopolitical and strategic priorities in the Indo-Pacific.”\nIndia, the US, Australia and Japan are members of the Indo-Pacific strategic alliance known as the Quad, which has repeatedly accused China of flexing its military muscles in the South China Sea and aggressively pushing its maritime territorial claims. The navies of the four countries regularly hold drills seen as part of an initiative to counter China’s growing assertiveness in the Pacific.\nBeijing maintains that its military is purely defensive to protect what it says are its sovereign rights, and calls the Quad an attempt to contain its economic growth and influence.\nFor Indian naval planners, the South China Sea remains a top concern, with about 60 percent of India’s cargo passing through shipping lanes in the Beijing-dominated region.\nChawla said India doesn't have the “strength to project power into the South China Sea right now” because of the vast Chinese maritime assets there.\n“Frankly, if it comes to a shooting war, India does not really have the capability and Quad does not have the mandate,\" he said. \"You know, it’s not a NATO-like alliance yet.”\nTags:\n#International\nKeywords:\nIndia-China Rivalries\nIndian Navy\nMaritime Power\nRed sea\nMilitary\nSHARE\nURL berhasil di salin."

Meanwhile, Indonesia is expected to achieve a growth rate of 5 percent for the current year and the following year.\n\"Global activity proved resilient in the second half of last year, as demand and supply factors supported major economies. On the demand side, stronger private and government spending sustained activity, despite tight monetary conditions. On the supply side, increased labor force participation, mended supply chains, and cheaper energy and commodity prices helped, despite renewed geopolitical uncertainties,\" IMF chief economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas said on Thursday.\nThe 2024 projection is 0.2 percentage points higher than the October 2023 World Economic Outlook (WEO), but still below the historical average of 3.8 percent in the 2000-2019 period.\nIndonesia is projected to maintain a 5 percent growth rate for the current and upcoming years, consistent with the growth observed in the previous year.&nbsp;\nAdvertisement\nIn contrast, The World Bank predicts a decrease in growth, falling from 5.3 percent in 2022 to 5 percent in 2023. This downward trend extends to both 2024 and 2025, with the growth rate projected to be 4.9 percent in each of those years.\n\"We expect slower growth in the United States, where tight monetary policy is still working through the economy, and in China, where weaker consumption and investment continue to weigh on activity. Many other economies continue to show great resilience, with growth accelerating in Brazil, India, and Southeast Asia’s major economies,\" Gourinchas said.\nIMF growth projections by region as published in IMF\nInflation continues to ease, with global headline inflation projected to decrease to 5.8 percent in 2024 and further to 4.4 percent in 2025. Core inflation, excluding the influence of volatile food and energy prices, is also on a downward trend. In advanced economies, both headline and core inflation are anticipated to average around 2.6 percent this year, aligning closely with the inflation targets set by central banks.\nGourinchas warned that markets may appear excessively optimistic about the prospects for early rate cuts as inflation eases.&nbsp;\nMost institutions are predicting a reduction of approximately 100 to 125 basis points (bps) in interest rates this year, which would result in the Federal Funds Rate hovering around 4-4.25%.\n\"Uncertainties remain and central banks now face two-sided risks. They must avoid premature easing that would undo many hard-earned credibility gains and lead to a rebound in inflation,\" he said.\nHowever, the biggest challenge ahead is to tackle elevated fiscal risks.&nbsp;\n\"Most countries came out of the pandemic and energy crisis with higher public debt levels and borrowing costs. Bringing down public debt and deficits will give space to deal with future shocks,\" he said.\nAccording to the IMF, Indonesia's government debt ratio in 2023 is only 39 percent of the total GDP, relatively low compared to neighboring countries.\n\"Emerging markets have been very resilient, with stronger-than-expected growth and stable external balances, partly due to improved monetary and fiscal frameworks. Yet divergence in policy between countries may spur capital outflows and currency volatility,\" he said.\nWorld Economic Outlook Growth Projections, January 2024 (IMF)\nTags:\n#Economy\nKeywords:\nIMF\neconomic growth\nSHARE\nURL berhasil di salin."

    "content": "Beijing.\nChina and Nauru formally restored diplomatic relations Wednesday after the tiny Pacific island nation cut its ties with Taiwan earlier this month, in a further move by Beijing to isolate Taipei's democratic government.\nChinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi met with Nauru’s Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade Lionel Aingimea at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse in Beijing, and Wang said the resumption of ties \"once again demonstrates to the world that adherence to the one-China principle is an irresistible historical trend.”\nAingimea said Nauru recognized that Taiwan is part of China, despite the fact that the People's Republic of China has never governed the island and that Taiwan's 23 million people overwhelmingly reject Beijing's claims to sovereignty over them.\n“We look forward to the practical cooperation that’s going to happen between Nauru and China. The prospect is bright,” Aingimea said.\nAdvertisement\nNauru’s announcement on Jan. 15 came just two days after Taiwan elected a new president and left the self-governing republic with only 12 remaining diplomatic allies, although it enjoys strong unofficial relations with the US, Japan and most other major nations.\nAmerican officials expressed disappointment with the decision. The United States has diplomatic relations with China but also maintains extensive unofficial ties with Taiwan, including selling it fighter jets and other weaponry for its defense.\nNauru first established diplomatic ties with Taiwan in 1980, then switched to Beijing in 2002, then back to Taiwan in 2005, amid allegations that both sides were paying off or otherwise pressuring Nauruan officials.\nChina claims Taiwan as its territory and doesn’t recognize its government or its right to diplomatic recognition, participation in global bodies such as the United Nations or any official contact with foreign political entities.\n“This policy change is a significant first step in moving forward with Nauru’s development,” Nauru's government said in a news release announcing the severing of relations with Taiwan.\nChina has been gradually poaching Taiwan's diplomatic allies, partly to punish the ruling Democratic Progressive Party that advocates maintaining the status quo under which Taiwan has its own government, military and de-facto independent status outside of the control of the PRC.\nTen countries have switched ties from Taipei to Beijing since the initial election of DPP President Tsai Ing-wen in 2016.\nChina says that Taiwan must come under its control at some point and has staged military drills around the island to demonstrate its determination.\nAt the time of the break with Nauru, Taiwan’s Deputy Foreign Minister Tien Chung-kwang accused China of purposefully timing the news to the election of current Vice President Lai Ching-te as the island's new leader. He said China's authoritarian one-party Communist government's intention was to \"attack the democracy and freedom that the Taiwanese people are proud of.”\nTaiwan now has official ties with 11 countries and the Vatican. Seven are in Latin America and the Caribbean, three are in the Pacific islands and one is in Africa.\nNauru's switching of relations has further intensified the focus on Taiwan's remaining allies, most of which are developing nations seen as vulnerable to China's global influence and willingness to offer hefty financial inducements.\nTags:\n#International\nKeywords:\nChina-Taiwan relations\nNauru\nOne-China Policy\nWang Yi\nDiplomatic relations\nSHARE\nURL berhasil di salin."

    "content": "The year-end festivities ended a couple of weeks ago without leaving us a greater degree of certainty as to whether the world economy will be much better off than last year. Many countries still deal with the long-lasting impacts of trade wars, the Covid-19 pandemic, volatility of food and energy prices, war in Ukraine, long-term climate issues, debt traps, and high inflation.&nbsp;\nYet, since the second half of 2023, our world has been confronted by extreme El Niño, genocide in Gaza, increased tensions in the Korean Peninsula, a new conflict at the Red Sea, and potentially a military standoff in the South China Sea. Predicting the specific details of global trade in 2024 is therefore challenging due to the dynamic nature of the global economy and the influence of various factors.\nOne report by the World Bank entitled “Global Economic Prospect 2024” suggests that as we are nearing the midpoint of what we expected to be a transformative decade for development, the global economy is set to rack up a rather disappointing record by the end of 2024, which is the slowest half-decade of GDP growth in 30 years.&nbsp;\nIt may be true that the global economy looked slightly better last year as the risk of global recession receded. In fact, UNCTAD reported that global FDI in 2023 grew by 3 percent as recession fears eased. But mounting geopolitical and military tensions may bring down the global economy this year much deeper than one can predict.\nAdvertisement\nPersistent conflicts, intensifying climate crises, a fragile global economy and the potential risks of new technologies have indeed created a complex global security environment. This was acknowledged by a high-level panel top diplomats and security officials at the World Economic Forum (WEF) held in Davos on January 16, 2024.&nbsp;\nThe session, which discussed the issue of “securing an insecure world,” was attended by Nigerian Foreign Minister Yusuf Tuggar, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg), Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud, Finnish Foreign Minister Elina Valtonen, US Senator Christopher A. Coons, WEF-Geneva President BØrge Brende, and German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock.&nbsp;\nUnsurprisingly, while all the panelists were on the same page to recognize how fragile our world is these days, they held different views on what to prioritize to fix it. Some suggested to re-develop frank conversations through diplomacy, some others proposed to first build confidence by scaling down military conflicts and show-offs, while others called for self-restraint from provoking adversaries.\nIn her relentless efforts to fix the multilateral trading system in a time of great turbulence, and as a lead-up to the 13th WTO Ministerial Conference (MC13) on 26 – 29 February in Abu Dhabi, WTO Director-General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala called on member countries to roll back recent food export restrictions as well as the accumulated stockpile of longstanding trade-restricting measures. She urged members to do their part to put the world economy on firmer footing by working collectively to reinforce the multilateral trading system and delivering results at the MC13.&nbsp;\nThis was followed by a report from Geneva on December 18, 2023, suggesting that the ongoing informal talks on reforming the WTO’s dispute settlement rules -- one of the most contentious issues in Geneva -- were nearing their conclusion and that the “finish line is within reach.”\nOn January 17, 2024, WTO Deputy Director-General Angela Ellard offered her observation that a key priority for MC13 is to build on the achievements of the previous June 2022 Ministerial Conference (MC12) by concluding the second wave of negotiations on fisheries subsidies and ensuring the entry into force of the Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies.&nbsp;\nOther negotiating priorities include dispute settlement reform and extending the moratorium on the imposition of customs duties on electronic transmissions, which will expire if members do not renew it at MC13.&nbsp;\nIn addition, the negotiations on agriculture continue, with many members pointing to food security as an important priority. &nbsp;\nHowever, the talks remain difficult as members have different views on issues such as public stockholding for food security purposes, domestic support, and market access.\nOur world today bodes ill for any hope that global trade will pick up any time soon to its pre-trade wartime and regain its role as a main engine of growth. Confronted by the vagueness of the global economy, governments and businesses will likely keep on adapting and adjusting themselves to the changing realities.&nbsp;\nObservers and practitioners generally believe that there will be more on-shoring and friend-shoring, diversification of export markets and import sources, a “tit-for-tat” approach, trade coercions, and restrictions on inbound and outbound investment. It is also believed that the global economy will not recover strongly any time soon, which is anticipated to slow to 2.4 percent this year before creeping up to 2.7 percent next year.&nbsp;\nBut there are other developments to observe which may slow down the global growth even further.&nbsp;\nFirst, conflict in areas critical for food and energy supplies. Any escalation in these parts of the global supply chains will hamper the fights against high inflation and thus lower the prospects for stronger growth.&nbsp;\nSecondly, the anticipated economic slowdown in China. Due to its massive economic presence around the globe, a slowdown in China’s economy will adversely affect other countries that depend heavily on trade with China.&nbsp;\nThird, while there are signs of an easing of interest rates in most countries, its pace is not fast enough and may be compounded by new military conflicts or China’s economic slowdown.&nbsp;\nAdd to this is the fact that more than 35 countries will hold their general elections this year, and some of them are countries of politically and economically global influence. Due to the current global economic, political, and security tensions, economic nationalism has become a major theme for those running for political positions in those countries.&nbsp;\nIt can be expected, therefore, that global trade will continue to be fragmented along geopolitical considerations, thus amplifying the trends we have been witnessing in the last two to three years. International cooperation will become more challenging to pursue except amongst allies and politically like-minded countries.\nBut perhaps one should observe the world economy today from a different angle.&nbsp;\nWhile there is growing dissatisfaction with the concept of globalization, the strong return of cross-border trade, capital and people flow in the last two years may indicate that much of global integration is not easily rescindable.&nbsp;\nIn other words, globalization is not dead yet but, instead, it is undergoing a reconfiguration process along geopolitical lines. Governments and businesses need to adjust and adapt to it without knowing -- at least at this point in time --what would be the end game.\n---\nIman Pambagyo is the Indonesian Ambassador to the WTO from 2014-2015.\nThe views expressed in this article are those of the author.\n&nbsp;\nTags:\n#Trade\nKeywords:\nglobal trade\nWorld Economic Forum\nWorld Trade Organization\nNgozi Okonjo-Iweala\nSHARE\nURL berhasil di salin."

As the presidential candidates prepare for the upcoming debate, Indonesia's 6th President, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono (SBY), sheds light on the potential effects of the 2024 presidential election on the geopolitical and security landscape in Asia.&nbsp;\nSBY points out three important presidential elections are set for 2024: Indonesia's in February, Taiwan's in January, and the United States' in November. These elections are expected to have a big impact on the region.\n\"The upcoming presidential election in Indonesia, scheduled for February 2024, holds crucial significance in the context of Asia's geopolitics and security,\" he tweeted on his X account @SBYudhoyono on Sunday.\nSBY underscores Indonesia's role as the largest country in Southeast Asia and a member of the G-20, positioning it as a regional power and a global player. He highlights the importance of the next Indonesian president understanding the need to maintain stability in both East and Southeast Asia, enabling them to engage in intelligent foreign policy and diplomacy.\nAdvertisement\n\"The future president, by fostering collaboration within ASEAN nations, can contribute to finding peaceful solutions to any conflicts arising in East and Southeast Asia. This approach prevents disasters in the Asian region and beyond, safeguarding international peace and security,\" SBY said.\nSBY also highlights two significant presidential elections with implications for Asia's geopolitics and security. Recognizing the global significance of Taiwan's status, he underscores its influence on the region's security, especially amid the escalating tensions between China and Taiwan.\n\"If the new president of Taiwan adopts a hardline stance and is highly anti-China, tensions between China and Taiwan will intensify,\" warns SBY.\nAdditionally, SBY points out that the outcome of the US presidential election this year can significantly impact East Asia, especially if the new president takes a tough stance against the unification of China and Taiwan. This scenario could turn East Asia into a potential flashpoint, with geopolitical and security repercussions.\nConversely, SBY suggests that if both the US president and the new president of Taiwan adopt moderate positions and are open to negotiations, global concerns about the possibility of open military conflicts in East Asia could decrease.\nThe third debate for the 2024 Presidential Election, featuring candidates Anies Baswedan, Prabowo Subianto, and Ganjar Pranowo, will focus on defense, security, international relations, globalization, geopolitics, and foreign policy.

    "content": "Jakarta.\n&nbsp;Indonesia stepped up measures to assert its influence in the regional and global forums throughout 2023, riding on its successful&nbsp;leadership of the Group of 20 the prior year.\nThe country assumed the rotating chair of the economic bloc ASEAN in 2023 and initiated policies to keep the regional grouping relevant amid escalating geopolitical tensions and optimize its economic potential in the face of growing China-US rivalries and trade restrictions from the European Union.\nAs Russia’s military invasion of Ukraine continued and a new war erupted between Israel and the militant group Hamas in the Gaza Strip, President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo took a leading role in global diplomacy to restore international order and pursue global peace.\nDuring his international tours, Jokowi has met in person with Xi Jinping, Joe Biden, Vladimir Putin, Narendra Modi, and Emmanuel Macron and convened with the leaders of the Arab League throughout last year to reiterate that arms conflicts posed serious risks to global food security and energy supplies.\nAdvertisement\nAgainst the backdrop of his final year in the presidency, the Jokowi administration has conducted arguably the most extensive global diplomatic effort in a single year.\nHere is a recap of events that encapsulate Indonesia's foreign policy actions in 2023.&nbsp;\nASEAN Chairmanship\nPresident Joko 'Jokowi' Widodo and other Southeast Asian leaders do the ASEAN handshake at the 43rd ASEAN Summit in Jakarta on September 5, 2023. (Photo Courtesy of 2023 ASEAN Summit Media Center)\nIndonesia helmed the Southeast Asian bloc under the theme “ASEAN Matters: Epicentrum of Growth”. The last time it assumed the chairmanship was in 2011. As the 2023 chair, Indonesia wanted to strengthen ASEAN as a fast-growing and sustainable economic region. Jakarta also tried to show that ASEAN remained relevant and important to its people and beyond.\nIndonesia wrapped up its year-long chairmanship with some documents, including a deal on electric vehicles (EVs) that can help ASEAN cut emissions while also driving economic growth. ASEAN -- along with China, Japan, and South Korea -- agreed to work together on building the regional EV ecosystem. Japan recently agreed to provide $1 billion to build this ecosystem of e-mobility.&nbsp;\nASEAN also launched the negotiations for the Digital Economy Framework Agreement (DEFA) last year. ASEAN’s digital economy is set to reach $2 trillion by 2030 if the DEFA is in place. The DEFA pact can help spur Indonesia’s internet economy to $800 billion. The pact is touted to be the world’s first major region-wide digital economy agreement.\nChair Indonesia wanted to maintain ASEAN’s neutral stance amid the growing tension between US and China.\n\"ASEAN agreed to not become a proxy to any power. … Don't turn our ship into a battleground for rivalries that destroy one another,\" Jokowi said when kicking off the 43rd ASEAN Summit in Jakarta on September 5, 2023.\n\"This ocean is too vast for us to sail alone. We will meet other ships, namely ASEAN's dialogue partners. Let us work in concert to achieve a fair and mutually beneficial cooperation as we sail towards an epicentrum of growth,\" Jokowi said.\n2023 marks the first time Timor Leste -- who has been seeking a seat in ASEAN for over a decade -- attended the group’s meetings as an observer. ASEAN leaders have adopted a roadmap for Timor Leste to become a full-fledged member. During his visit to Jakarta in August, Timor Leste President José Ramos Horta said that a full membership should ideally occur in 2025 as the extra two years would mean that his country could be more prepared.\nNon-Megaphone Diplomacy on Myanmar&nbsp;\nMyanmar once again has its seat empty at the ASEAN Ministerial Meeting in Jakarta on September 5, 2023. (Antara Photo/43rd ASEAN Summit/Aditya Pradana Putra)\nThe Myanmar crisis posed one of the toughest challenges to Indonesia’s chairmanship. The Myanmar junta to this day still fails to implement the five-point consensus, a peace plan that demands a constructive dialogue among all parties.\nThe Myanmar coup-d’etat erupted in February 2021. Brunei Darussalam was the ASEAN chair at the time. The succeeding chairs Cambodia –- and eventually Indonesia -- had to inherit the task of tackling the Myanmar issue.&nbsp;\nJakarta favored adopting a non-megaphone diplomacy, meaning that it had been quietly engaging the Myanmar stakeholders -- including the military junta as well as the government-in-exile National Unity Government (NUG). Foreign Affairs Minister Retno Marsudi in late December told reporters that Indonesia had made over 180 engagements with these stakeholders.&nbsp;\nWhen the leaders gathered in Jakarta in September, the bloc agreed to form a troika -- an informal consultation mechanism consisting of current, previous, and incoming ASEAN chairs -- to cool down the Myanmar crisis. Retno said that Indonesia had informed the 2024 chair Laos of what Jakarta had done so far on the Myanmar matter.&nbsp;\n“Indonesia is more than ready to contribute. I believe all of us in ASEAN share the same goal of seeing peace and stability in Myanmar,” Retno said.\nStand with Palestine\nPresident Joko 'Jokowi' Widodo hugs his Palestinian counterpart Mahmoud Abbas on the sidelines of the Arab-Islamic Joint Summit in Riyadh on Nov. 11, 2023. (Photo Courtesy of Presidential Press Bureau)\nMilitant group Hamas launched an unprecedented attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, triggering an escalation of conflict with millions of Gazans now suffering from the war.&nbsp;\nThe worsening situation prompted leaders of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) and the Arab League to hold an emergency summit in Riyadh the following month. Jokowi told the summit that Israel’s \"barbaric actions\" were not an act of self-defense.&nbsp;\nThe US has been under fire for supporting Israel. Aside from vetoing a UN resolution on a Gaza humanitarian pause, Washington has been providing military funding -- which topped $3.8 billion in 2023 -- to Israel. On the margins of the Riyadh Summit, Jokowi promised Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas that he would relay the latter’s message to US President Joe Biden whom he would be meeting shortly.\nThe Riyadh summit appointed Indonesia, along with some other nations, to send its foreign minister to push for international action to stop the war. Retno, along with her OIC counterparts, later in November toured around UN Security Council permanent members -- China, Russia, the UK, and France -- to garner their support. The delegates, however, skipped the US despite also being a permanent member of the UN Security Council.&nbsp;\nIndonesia sent some logistics aid to Gaza as the war puts the Palestinian enclave in dire need of assistance. The archipelagic country deployed its first batch of assistance amounting to 51.5 tons on Nov. 4, and another 21 tons of aid about two weeks later.&nbsp;\nAlso in the same year, Jakarta won overwhelming support to be reelected into the UN Human Rights Council. According to Retno, Indonesia plans to serve the council for the 2024-2026 term with Palestinian advocacy high on the agenda.\nNo Rush on BRICS Membership\nPresident Joko 'Jokowi' Widodo attends the BRICS Summit in Johannesburg, South Africa, on August 24, 2023. (Photo Courtesy of Presidential Press Bureau)\nIn August, President Jokowi attended a summit organized by an economic bloc comprising Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa, known as BRICS. His participation in the Summit in Johannesburg triggered speculations about Indonesia's intention to join the club.\nHowever,&nbsp;Jokowi made it clear that Indonesia still had not signed up with the BRICS.\n“A country has to submit an expression of interest to join BRICS. … To this day, Indonesia has not submitted such a letter,” Jokowi said after the summit.\n“We intend to conduct thorough study and calculation first. We do not want to rush. We share great relations with the five&nbsp;BRICS members,&nbsp;particularly from an economic standpoint.”&nbsp;\nThe group recently expanded after Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Iran, and Ethiopia officially joined.\nEnergy Transition Isn't Cheap\nOn the climate front, Jokowi never failed to highlight at global forums that an energy transition would require substantial investments. The huge amount of money needed sets a major roadblock for developing economies’ energy transition journey.\n“All these efforts need substantial financing. It would be impossible for developing countries to do it alone. Indonesia needs investments worth over $1 trillion to reach net zero emission by 2060,” Jokowi told the UN climate forum COP28 in Dubai on Dec. 1.\nIn a similar fashion, Jokowi told the&nbsp;Asia Zero Emission Community (AZEC) Summit in Tokyo later that month that ASEAN would need $29.4 trillion by 2050 to fund its energy transition efforts.\nJokowi, Joe Biden, and Xi Jinping\nPresident Joko 'Jokowi' Widodo meets his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping in Beijing on Oct. 17, 2023. The sign reads 'the commercial operation of the Jakarta-Bandung high-speed train. (Photo Courtesy of Presidential Press Bureau)\nIn 2023, Jokowi visited the US and China as Jakarta sought to maintain close ties with the world's two biggest&nbsp;economies. Jokowi flew to China for some talks on trade with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping in July. The Indonesian leader returned to China the following month to celebrate a decade of Xi’s brainchild Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). The BRI sees China making major infrastructure investments across the globe. This includes the $7.3 billion high-speed train project linking Jakarta and Bandung which was largely funded by China.\nThe year saw Indonesia and the US upgrading their ties to a comprehensive strategic partnership -- the highest possible status of cooperation. US President Joe Biden announced the new status when he hosted Jokowi at the White House in November 2023.\nBoth leaders agreed to develop a critical mineral action plan. Indonesia today does not have a free trade agreement with the US, thus the domestically produced batteries for electric vehicles would not be eligible for the tax credits under the USA's Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), making them less competitive in the American market. Indonesia hopes the aforementioned action plan can culminate in the formal negotiations for a deal that can make Indonesia’s processed minerals and EV batteries covered by the IRA.\nGovernment data showed that Indonesia-China trade totaled $104.8 billion in January-October 2023 with Jakarta booking a $1.6 billion surplus. Indonesia’s trade with the US reached $28.7 billion over the same period. Indonesia recorded a $9.8 billion surplus with the US.&nbsp;\nChina and the US are among&nbsp;the top five&nbsp;of Indonesia’s largest sources of foreign direct investment (FDI) in January- September 2023. China ranked second place ($5.6 billion), while the US placed fifth ($2.4 billion).&nbsp;\nPresident Joko 'Jokowi' Widodo meets his American counterpart Joe Biden at the White House in Washington DC on Nov. 13, 2023. (Photo Courtesy of Presidential Press Bureau)\nIndonesia-EU: From Nickel Dispute to Anti-Deforestation Law\nThe ties between Indonesia and the European Union have faced some challenges over the past years, particularly on the economic front. Jokowi has begun banning exports of unprocessed mining minerals such as nickel to develop local industries and generate jobs. The&nbsp;policy of putting forward the domestic industry first was integral in Jokowi’s economic diplomacy. The EU, however, was not happy with the nickel export ban and sued Indonesia at the World Trade Organization (WTO).&nbsp;\nThe EU’s anti-deforestation law then put another strain on its ties with Indonesia. The EU Deforestation Regulation (EUDR) mandates traders to prove that their palm oil, among other commodities, does not come from deforested land before entering the EU market. The European bloc requires the geolocation coordinates of where they grow the palm oil as proof. Indonesia fears smallholders will struggle to comply with the regulation. Chief Economic Affairs Minister Airlangga Hartarto even accused the EU of \"imperialism\" by issuing the EUDR.&nbsp;\nIndonesia chose not to sit still. Jakarta and fellow palm oil producer Malaysia sent a joint mission to Brussels to protest against the regulation. This eventually led to the formation of an ad hoc joint task force between the EU, Indonesia, and Malaysia to find the best possible solution.\nAt the same time, Indonesia and the EU have been trying to seal an overdue trade pact. Both sides have agreed to conclude the Indonesia-EU Comprehensive Partnership Agreement negotiations (CEPA) this year.&nbsp;\nOECD Bid\nPresident Joko 'Jokowi' Widodo shakes hands with Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Secretary-General Mathias Cormann at the Merdeka Palace in Jakarta on Aug. 10, 2023. (Photo Courtesy of the Presidential Press Bureau)\nJokowi is actively pursuing membership in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). After being a key partner of the OECD for over a decade, Indonesia officially applied to join the group in July. The government finds an OECD membership can result in policy reforms, which can be Indonesia’s ticket to become an advanced economy.&nbsp;\nWhenever he met leaders of OECD members, Jokowi would often take the opportunity to ask for their support. Indonesia said that OECD members had backed Jakarta’s candidacy. But one thing to note is that it takes years for a country to actually secure a seat in the group. As a case in point, Chile’s accession process spanned seven&nbsp;years before it could officially be a full-fledged member.\nIndonesia on Rohingya Refugees\nRohingya refugees stranded in Banda Aceh on Dec. 12, 2023. (Antara Photo/Irwansyah Putra)\nNear the end of the year, Indonesia faced an influx of Rohingya refugees, sparking protests from locals. The Associated Press wrote that over 1,500 fleeing Rohingyans have arrived in Aceh since November. Jokowi blamed the influx of refugees on people smuggling syndicates. He vowed to take stern measures against the perpetrators. According to Jokowi, Indonesia plans to accommodate the Rohingya refugees temporarily.\n“We will provide temporary humanitarian aid to refugees while still prioritizing the interests of the local community. The Indonesian government will continue to coordinate with international organizations to address this issue,” Jokowi saidon Dec. 8.\nIndonesia is not a signatory to the 1951 Refugees Convention. Therefore, Indonesia bears no obligation to accept the refugees. According to Foreign Ministry spokesman Lalu Muhammad Iqbal, Indonesia has been accepting the Rohingya refugees based on “humanitarian reasons”.\n“Ironically, state parties to the convention have closed their doors and even pushed back the refugees,” Lalu said in November.\nWho Is Next?\nThis weekend, presidential candidates -- Prabowo Subianto, Ganjar Pranowo, and Anies Baswedan -- will take the stage once again for a debate on geopolitics and international relations, among other things. All candidates already gave a sneak peek of their foreign policies at a series of conferences held by the Central Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) in November.\nPrabowo, who currently serves as the Defense Minister, told the CSIS forum that he would carry on Jokowi’s economic diplomacy. This means that if elected, Prabowo plans on making sure that Indonesia processes its natural resources --including minerals -- at home rather than exporting them unprocessed. Prabowo wants to maintain a “good neighbor policy” in the region and beyond, even saying that “1,000 friends is too few, one enemy is too many.”\nGanjar wants to stick to Indonesia’s free and active policy in which the country does not align with major powers. But by “free”, it should mean that Indonesia independently designs much more strategic policies, according to Ganjar. He also wants Indonesia to be the global “safe haven” for industrialization.\nSpeaking at the CSIS forum, Anies said he wanted to pursue a “value-led foreign policy”. He finds that Indonesia has been too business-oriented, saying that Jakarta only wants to partake in foreign matters if it can get economic gains in return.&nbsp;\nThe debate is set to take place this weekend.\nFrom left: Presidential candidates Ganjar Pranowo, Prabowo Subianto, and Anies Baswedan pose for a photo after the presidential debate at the General Election Commission (KPU) building in Jakarta, Tuesday, Dec. 12, 2023.

    "content": "A polarized reaction poured in Thursday to the death of former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, who managed to galvanize global attention decades after his official service as one of the most powerful diplomats in American history.\nKissinger, who died Wednesday in Connecticut at 100, was praised as a skilled defender of US interests by world leaders. On social media, he was widely called a war criminal who left lasting damage throughout the world.\n\"America has lost one of the most dependable and distinctive voices\" on foreign affairs, said former President George W. Bush, striking a tone that many high-level officials, past and present, tried to convey.\n“I have long admired the man who fled the Nazis as a young boy from a Jewish family, then fought them in the United States Army,” Bush said in a statement. “When he later became Secretary of State, his appointment as a former refugee said as much about his greatness as it did America’s greatness.”\nAdvertisement\nKissinger served two presidents, Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford, and dominated foreign policy as the United States withdrew from Vietnam and established ties with China.\nKissinger is revered in China for having engineered the opening of relations between the ruling Communist Party and Washington under Nixon.\nChinese Ambassador to the United States Xie Feng said he was “deeply shocked and saddened” at Kissinger’s death. “He will always remain alive in the hearts of the Chinese people as a most valued old friend.”\nAnother former US&nbsp;Secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, said Kissinger left an indelible mark on American and world history.\n“I will always be grateful for his gracious advice and help during my own time as Secretary,” Pompeo tweeted on X. “Always supportive and always informed, his wisdom made me better and more prepared after every one of our conversations.”\nCriticism of Kissinger, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, was especially strong on social media, where many posted celebratory videos in reaction to his death.\nA Rolling Stone magazine headline said, “Henry Kissinger, war criminal beloved by America's ruling class, finally dies.”\nKissinger's role in the US bombing of Cambodia “likely killed hundreds of thousands of Cambodians — and set (a) path for the ravages of the Khmer Rouge,” Sophal Ear, a scholar at Arizona State University who studies Cambodia's political economy, wrote on The Conversation.\n“The cluster bombs dropped on Cambodia under Kissinger’s watch continue to destroy the lives of any man, woman or child who happens across them,” Ear wrote.\nKissinger exerted uncommon influence on global affairs long after he left office. In July, for instance, he met Chinese leader Xi Jinping in Beijing while US-Chinese relations were at a low point.\nNixon’s daughters, Tricia Nixon Cox and Julie Nixon Eisenhower, said their father and Kissinger enjoyed “a partnership that produced a generation of peace for our nation.”\nKissinger initiated the Paris negotiations that ultimately provided a face-saving means to get the United States out of a costly war in Vietnam.\n“Dr. Kissinger played an important role in the historic opening to the People’s Republic of China and in advancing détente with the Soviet Union, bold initiatives which initiated the beginning of the end of the Cold War. His “shuttle diplomacy” to the Middle East helped to advance the relaxation of tensions in that troubled region of the world,” the Nixon daughters said in a statement.\nTags:\n#International\nKeywords:\nHenry Kissinger\nUS Diplomat\nUS Diplomacy\nSHARE\nURL berhasil di salin."

    "content": "Woodside, California.\nUS President Joe Biden and China’s Xi Jinping emerged Wednesday from their first face-to-face meeting in a year vowing to stabilize their fraught relationship and showcasing modest agreements to combat illegal fentanyl and re-establish military communications. But there were still deep differences in economic competition and global security threats.\nThe most assuring takeaway from the meeting for Biden was that if either man had a concern, “we should pick up the phone and call one another and we'll take the call. That's important progress,\" he said in a news conference following the talks.\nThe two leaders spent four hours together at a bucolic Northern California estate -- in meetings, a working lunch and a garden stroll -- intent on showing the world that while they are global economic competitors they’re not locked in a winner-take-all faceoff.\n“Planet Earth is big enough for the two countries to succeed,” Xi told Biden.\nAdvertisement\nThe US president told Xi: “I think it’s paramount that you and I understand each other clearly, leader-to-leader, with no misconceptions or miscommunications. We have to ensure competition does not veer into conflict.”\nTheir meeting, on the sidelines of the annual Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation conference, has far-reaching implications for a world grappling with economic cross-currents, conflicts in the Middle East and Europe, tensions in Taiwan and more\nThey reached expected agreements to curb illicit fentanyl production and to reopen military ties, Biden said. Many of the chemicals used to make synthetic fentanyl come from China to cartels that traffic the powerful narcotic into the US, which is facing an overdose crisis.\nTop military leaders will resume talks, Biden said, an increasingly important move particularly as unsafe or unprofessional incidents between the two nations’ ships and aircraft have spiked.\nUltimately, the agreements rely on trust between the two leaders.\n“I know the man I know his modus operandi,” Biden said of Xi. “We have disagreements but he’s been straight.”\nBut he still said Xi was a dictator ... “in a sense.”\nThe two leaders had a significant back and forth over Taiwan, with Biden chiding China over its massive military build-up around Taiwan and Xi telling Biden he had no plans to invade the island, according to a US official who spoke on condition of anonymity to detail the private talks.\nBiden, the official said, declared the US was committed to continuing to help Taiwan defend itself and maintain deterrence against a potential Chinese attack, and also called on China to avoid meddling in the island’s elections next year. The official described the Taiwan portion of the talks as “clear-headed” and “not heated.”\nBiden also called on Xi to use his influence with Iran to make clear that Tehran, and its proxies, should not take steps that would lead to an expansion of the Israel-Hamas war. Foreign Minister Wang Yi has assured the US that the Chinese have communicated concerns to Iran on the matter. But the official said the US&nbsp;has not been able to ascertain how seriously the Iranians are taking concerns raised by Beijing.\nAccording to a statement released by China Central Television, the state broadcaster, Xi was most focused on Taiwan and the US sanctions and restrictions against Chinese products and businesses.\nXi urged the US to support China’s peaceful unification with the self-governed island, calling Taiwan \"the most important and most sensitive issue” in the bilateral relations. He also raised Beijing’s concerns over export controls, investment screenings, and sanctions imposed by the US, which he said “have severely harmed China’s legitimate interests.\"\nHe said, “We hope the US side can seriously treat China’s concerns and take actions to remove unilateral sanctions and provide a fair, just, non-discriminatory environment for Chinese businesses.”\nXi said he and Biden also agreed to establish dialogues on artificial intelligence and stressed the urgency for the two countries to cope with the climate crisis, the state broadcaster reported.\nBoth leaders acknowledged the importance of their relationship and the need for better coordination. But their differences shone through: Xi indicated he wants better cooperation -- but on China's terms. And he sought to project strength to his domestic audience in the face of US policies restricting imports from China and limiting technology transfers to Beijing.\nBiden, meanwhile, will also spend time this week in California working to highlight new alliances in the Indo Pacific and efforts to boost trade with other regional leaders.\nThey sought to build back to a stable baseline after already tense relations took a nosedive following the US downing of a Chinese spy balloon that had traversed the continental US, and amid differences over the self-ruled island of Taiwan, China’s hacking of a Biden official’s emails and other matters.\nFor Biden, Wednesday's meeting was a chance for the president to do what he believes he does best: in-person diplomacy.\n“As always, there's no substitute for face-to-face discussions,” he told Xi. With his characteristic optimism, Biden sketched a vision of leaders who manage competition “responsibly,” adding, \"that's what the United States wants and what we intend to do.”\nXi, for his part, was gloomy about the state of the post-pandemic global economy. China’s economy remains in the doldrums, with prices falling due to slack demand from consumers and businesses.\n“The global economy is recovering, but its momentum remains sluggish,” Xi said. “Industrial and supply chains are still under the threat of interruption and protectionism is rising. All these are grave problems.\"\nBiden and Xi held their talks at Filoli Estate, a country house and museum about 25 miles (40 kilometers) south of San Francisco. The event was carefully staged, Biden first to arrive at the grand estate.\nAfter a handshake and smiles, the presidents and their respective aides on trade, the economy, national security and regional diplomacy gathered across from one another at a single long table, the culmination of negotiations between the two leaders’ top aides over the past several months. It was Biden and Xi’s first conversation of any kind since they met last November in Bali.\nNext came a working lunch with inner-circle members from both administrations. They ate ravioli, chicken and broccolini, with almond meringue cake and praline buttercream for dessert.\nBefore they parted, the two strolled the property along a red brick path through impressive topiary and knotted gothic trees. Asked by reporters how the meeting went, the president said “well” and flashed a thumbs up.\nThere were light moments between the two leaders who have logged much time together over the last decade. Biden asked Xi to extend his early birthday wishes to Xi’s wife, who will be celebrating next week. Xi thanked the president for reminding him. The Chinese leader said that he’s been so busy working he had forgotten the big day was nearing.\nThe relationship between China and the US has never been smooth, Xi said. Still, it has kept moving forward. \"For two large countries like China and the United States, turning their back on each other is not an option,” he said.\nMore pointedly, Xi also suggested it was not up to the US to dictate how the Chinese manage their affairs, saying, “It is unrealistic for one side to remodel the other, and conflict and confrontation has unbearable consequences for both sides.”\nTags:\n#International\nKeywords:\nJoe Biden\nXi Jinping\nXi Jinping-Joe Biden Meeting\nUS-China relations\nSHARE\nURL berhasil di salin."

    "date": "2023-10-16 16:35:00",
    "content": "Centuries ago, European explorers sought spices in the Indonesian archipelago, monopolizing global spice trade and bringing immense wealth to those who came. Now, history repeats itself with lithium as the future spice.\nThe urgent demand for lithium in electric vehicle (EV) manufacturing has generated an unprecedented need for this alkali, causing its price to skyrocket. Lithium has evolved from being merely a catalyst for making glass and ceramics to an indispensable element for the global energy transition. Since 2020, lithium prices have surged more than tenfold, reaching record highs of nearly $85,000 per metric ton.\nArgentina, Bolivia, and Chile are at the center of this transformative industry. There lies what is known as the Lithium Triangle, a region of the Andes that is abundant in lithium reserves. These countries hold 53 percent of the world's confirmed lithium reserves, with 21 million tons in Bolivia, 20 million tons in Argentina, and another 11 million tonnes in Chile, according to the 2023 US Geological Survey report.\nWhat sets them apart from other lithium-producing countries like Australia, China, and the US is their expansive lithium brine source in salt flats. While hard rock lithium mining uses traditional ore techniques and thus requires a huge capital in the initial stages of the operation, lithium brine relies on solar evaporation and normally needs less capital to start. Lithium brine can also yield lithium carbonate, a product that is already in high demand in the battery market.\nAdvertisement\nThe emerging strategic importance of lithium has drawn significant foreign capital. Many countries are now aware that gaining control over the lithium supply chain is the key to maintaining technological edge and geopolitical influence. Lithium has become part of the great power competition, with the US and China at the forefront of this race.\nMany global companies have attempted to gain control of this Triangle. China has surged ahead, securing a dominant position, with the US and other developed countries trailing behind. In Chile, concessions have already been made for SQM, a Chilean firm partially owned by China, and the US-based Albermarle. In Argentina, Ganfeng Lithium has become the majority stakeholder in Caucharí-Olaroz salt flats. China's reach in Argentina could widen in the future through its Belt and Road Initiative, which Argentina joined in 2022.\nIn contrast, the US is intensifying efforts to strengthen its domestic battery production in bid to achieve complete North American production for EV components. Despite its ambitions of achieving half of the EV sales by 2030, these efforts are predominantly limited within U.S. borders and among its North American partners.\nChile: Leading the Charge\nAmong the countries in the Lithium Triangle, Chile stands as the only country currently producing lithium on a competitive commercial scale. In 2022, Chile contributed around 25 percent of the world's lithium output, second only to Australia. Chile boasts an array of more than 40 salt flats, with dozens of them already in varying degrees of operational readiness. Coupled with its friendly investment climate, the country’s primacy in lithium production is driven by the ideal conditions it offers, such as the brine’s purity, a favorable climate, and the proximity of salt flats to the ports.\nTo bolster lithium production and the state’s interest, Chilean President Gabriel Boric announced the national strategy for lithium in April 2023. Central to this strategy is the establishment of a 100-percent state-owned lithium company, entrusted with coordinating public-private cooperation for salt flat exploitation.&nbsp;\nAlthough initially hinted at by the media as the nationalization or complete state control of the lithium resource, this move in fact does the contrary. The government-facilitated partnership can actually boost the investors’ confidence, knowing that they will receive government support and access to a more transparent regulatory framework. This will encourage more foreign companies to inject their capital in Chile’s lithium projects.\nChile is also gearing up for developing the downstream lithium industry, a strategic move that will position the country as the champion of the clean energy revolution. Plans are already underway, with Chile's salt flats concession authority Corfo announcing a partnership with China's BYD, the world’s largest EV producer. BYD, which manufactured 1.8 million EVs in 2022 --surpassing Tesla’s 1.3 million EVs-- will invest $290 million in a lithium cathode factory in Antofagasta.\nIn a mutually beneficial arrangement, 25 percent of the lithium produced in the Salar de Atacama, Chile's largest salt flat, will go to Corfo at lower prices. The produced lithium will serve as the raw materials for the partnership with BYD.\nArgentina: Eyeing for the Runner-Up Position\nArgentina is the world’s fourth-largest lithium producer, accounting for 6 percent of the global production. However, the country is projected to overtake Chile as the second-largest producer before the end of this decade.&nbsp;\nArgentina’s advantage lies in many advanced exploration phases. Argentina currently has six lithium projects under construction and dozens others in the advanced exploration or feasibility stages. Existing operations are expected to give a boost to Argentina’s lithium production. The US firm Livent's Fénix project and Australian Allkem Ltd's Salar de Olaroz project are set to double their lithium output to reach 42,500 tonnes. The Cauchari-Olaroz project, jointly owned by China and Canada, will commence production this year with a capacity of 40,000 tons of lithium carbonate.\nWhat has also become Argentina’s uniqueness in the lithium competition is its flexibility, thanks to its federal system. Within this system, mineral resources fall under provincial jurisdiction, allowing lithium-rich provinces like Catamarca, Salta, and Jujuy, to manage their reserves separate from federal oversight. China has leveraged this regional approach, contributing to its triumph in establishing a presence in the region.\nProvincial authorities hold the authority to issue concessions and permits, fostering joint ventures and exploration initiatives with foreign enterprises. In Catamarca’s case, this decentralized approach has led to numerous partnerships between its provincial firm, CAMYEN, with foreign companies in exploration and exploitation activities.\nBolivia: Still Largely Untapped Potential\nDespite having the largest lithium reserve out of the three, Bolivia significantly lags behind Chile and Argentina in its lithium exploitation. Unlike those of its neighbors, Bolivia’s salt flats contain higher levels of impurities and frequently endure an extended rainy season, making it harder to achieve commercial feasibility.\nTo overcome this challenge, Bolivia's lithium company, YLB, has called foreign companies to develop Direct Lithium Extraction (DLE) technology. The DLE can bypass the need to evaporate lithium brine in huge evaporation pools by directly channeling the brine into a processing unit, where it undergoes chemical procedures to produce lithium carbonate or lithium hydroxide swiftly. This method will eliminate the dependency to weather changes.\nBolivia has recently inked agreements with Russia's Rosatom and China's Citic Guoan Group and CATL. These deals will enable the construction of two DLE processing plants that are expected to produce more than 45,000 tons of lithium carbonate annually. Rosatom, in particular, has committed a substantial $600 million to this project, marking Russia’s first large-scale lithium project abroad.\nOpportunities for Indonesia?\nAt the recent 43rd ASEAN Summit, President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo underscored the importance of a sustainable supply chain for advancing the EV ecosystem. President Jokowi’s vision is clear: ASEAN must be able to boost its economic growth by riding the waves of the EV boom. Indonesia subsequently deals an agreement involving South Korea, Japan, and China to foster the EV industry.\nIndonesia itself seeks to be the world’s leading car battery producer. The country’s automotive industry even aims to have EVs represent 20 percent of the manufactured vehicles by 2025. Despite Indonesia’s abundance in nickel, it is a different story for lithium. According to state-owned mining firm MIND ID, the domestic upstream mining industry in Indonesia still imports lithium hydroxide from China, Australia, and Chile, with an annual demand of around 70,000 tons. This import dependency encompasses 20 percent of the raw materials required for EV batteries.\nIndonesia cannot fall behind the US, China, and other developed countries in the race for lithium. In this consideration, Latin America offers prospective and lucrative incentives for securing lithium. Indonesia should eye for more ambitious targets, including acquiring several lithium mines abroad through private-public partnerships with local enterprises.\nIndonesia actually has taken encouraging initial actions. For instance, the recently signed memorandum of understanding (MoU) between Indonesia’s Chamber of Commerce and Industry (Kadin) and the Western Australian government to explore potential critical mineral cooperation to develop the EV industry. MIND ID's ongoing efforts to solidify plans for acquiring lithium mines abroad are also a positive development.&nbsp;\nHowever, more players from the mining sector are needed to explore this untapped potential. Acquisitions need capital, technology, and expertise in mineral extraction, particularly in the salt flats of Lithium Triangle -- the region that is expected to dominate the global source of lithium in the near future. Sending our engineers and mining experts to this region would enable them to research and participate in lithium brine projects. Indonesia should also consider supplying nickel to this region, given the growth potential in the downstream lithium industry.\nAs Indonesia embarks on the journey to become the world's leading EV battery producer, it is imperative for Indonesia to actively participate in the global race to secure these critical resources.\n--\nAnindita Aji Pratama is an Indonesian diplomat with a passion for Latin American affairs and global political economy.

    "content": "Jakarta.\nDue to various supporting factors, mining company Petrosea (PTRO) has very positive prospects for the future.&nbsp;\nThe company has a mining contract worth $1.4 billion (around Rp 22 trillion), which accounts for 60 percent of PTRO's total contract backlog in 2023. This contract is mostly medium- to long-term, providing protection against market uncertainties.\nFull support from the new controller, Petrindo Jaya Kreasi (CUAN), part of the Barito Group owned by conglomerate Prajogo Pangestu, also strengthens PTRO’s position. This backing has enabled PTRO to secure large contracts in the mining and EPC segments, totaling $1.8 billion (around Rp 28.38 trillion).\nThe coal sector, which is one of PTRO's main focuses, still shows solid prospects.\nBisman Bakhtiar, Executive Director of the Center for Energy and Mining Law Studies, emphasized that coal prices will remain volatile in the future, but the outlook is quite positive. In the short and medium term, coal will still be needed in large volumes, supporting its price. According to him, factors driving higher coal prices include global geopolitical conditions and increasing demand from major countries such as China, India, and Europe, driven by growing industrial activity in these regions.\n\"The biggest challenge for coal is the progress of large-scale renewable energy projects and the issue of energy transition. Coal prices are predicted to be around $140 per ton in the future,\" Bisman recently said.&nbsp;\nHe believes that coal will still be needed and is unlikely to be replaced as a primary energy source. This means that coal could still perform well next year. Along with this, he assesses that the coal mining contract business remains solid, especially with established contractors like Petrosea.\n\"Mining services will continue to be important, and their prospects will align with the direction of coal,\" he added.\nYoga Ahmad Gifari, an analyst at Sucor Sekuritas, predicts that PTRO’s new contract acquisitions will boost the company’s revenue and profits in the coming years. In the EPC segment, the company is estimated to experience a 152 percent increase in revenue, reaching $747 million.\nMeanwhile, revenue from the mining segment is expected to surge by 60 percent, reaching $3.7 billion. According to Yoga, this projected growth will improve PTRO’s leverage compared to its previous position. Notably, the company’s contract base, mostly medium- and long-term, will also help maintain its revenue flow while reducing liquidity risk in the future.\n“We estimate the company’s CAGR to grow strongly by 59 percent from 2023 to 2028. This growth has the potential to be the highest among its peers in the industry,” Yoga wrote in his research published on Tuesday, December 11, 2024.\nThe projected profit growth of PTRO, indicated by the soaring contract volume in the mining segment and additional contributions from the coal sector, aligns with this outlook. According to Yoga, substantial additional contracts could accelerate PTRO’s revenue growth in the future with a higher CAGR than in the past four years.\nPTRO’s consolidation into the Petrindo Group ecosystem also opens up extensive opportunities for the company to expand and diversify its business. CUAN, as the parent company, still holds additional unexploited assets such as gold, copper, silver, and silica, which could become new sources of income for PTRO.\n“Thus, we see significant potential for PTRO to secure new projects that could drive substantial revenue growth in the future,” added Yoga.\nPTRO’s bright future is further reinforced by its solid financial position, enabling the company to expand its business smoothly with strong capital.\nAs of September 2024, PTRO recorded a debt-to-equity ratio (DER) of 1.0x, well below the 3.5x limit set by lenders. This ratio is expected to decline to 0.7x by 2028, supported by strong profit growth projections and a stable dividend payout policy of 30 percent.&nbsp;\nRecently, PTRO secured a credit facility of $480 million from Bank Central Asia (BBCA) to support its growth initiatives and debt refinancing. PTRO’s interest coverage ratio (ICR) stood at 1.7x in September 2024. With a projected CAGR for operational profit of 37 percent, the company’s ICR is expected to reach 9.5x by 2028.\n“We believe liquidity risk for bondholders will be well-managed in terms of liquidity. Given that the existing bank loans have longer maturity, with most of them being over 5 years, this will benefit bondholders,” Yoga said.&nbsp;\nPTRO listed its Sustainable Bond I Phase I and Sustainable Ijarah Sukuk I Phase I for 2024 on the Indonesia Stock Exchange, with a total value of Rp 1.5 trillion (about $93.8 million) on Monday. About Rp 1 trillion were sustainable bonds. The Sharia bond or sukuk ijarah was worth Rp 500 billion. Petrosea’s bonds also came in four series. Series A has a 367-day tenor with a 6.5 percent coupon. Series B has a three-year term and an 8 percent coupon. Series C has a five-year tenor and a coupon of 8.75 percent. Series D has a term of seven years with a coupon of 9.5 percent. Petrosea’s sukuk ijarah also has four series -- A, B, C, and D -- with each offering&nbsp; 100 percent of the remaining ijarah rewards.&nbsp;\nTags:\n#Special Updates\nKeywords:\nPTRO\nPetrosea\nSHARE\nURL berhasil di salin."

    "content": "Bangkok\n. Chinese leaders met this week to chart the country's economic strategy for the coming year, announcing plans to boost government spending and ease monetary policy to stimulate investment and consumer spending.\nThe two-day Central Economic Work Conference, which concluded Thursday, ended with praise for President Xi Jinping's leadership and a pledge to \"enrich and refine the policy toolbox\" in order to mitigate risks facing the world's second-largest economy. One of the primary concerns&nbsp;is the potential impact of tariffs proposed by President-elect Donald Trump on Chinese imports once he takes office.\nFocus on Economic Fundamentals\nAnalysts say the outcome of the Central Economic Work Conference, along with an earlier meeting of the Politburo, largely reiterated existing policy rather than unveiling new initiatives. China's economy has been growing more slowly than the \"about 5 percent\" target set for this year, with a prolonged real estate crisis weighing heavily on business activity. Weakened housing prices and job losses during the COVID-19 pandemic have resulted in lower consumer spending, leading to a situation where supply exceeds demand, driving prices down or keeping them flat.\nAdvertisement\nThe government began rolling out a&nbsp;range of initiatives&nbsp;earlier this year that included paying subsidies when people turn in&nbsp;old appliances and vehicles&nbsp;to buy new ones, expanding access to affordable housing and cutting interest rates to make mortgages more affordable.\nA readout from the official\nXinhua News Agency\nrevealed that leaders committed to focusing more on improving the people's well-being, strengthening the healthcare system, and expanding elderly care. The government may also introduce family subsidies to encourage higher birth rates as the population declines.\nFunding the Strategy\nThe Chinese leadership has pledged to raise the country's deficit, which has been capped at 3 percent&nbsp;of GDP, to support economic initiatives and stimulate consumer spending. The government intends to issue more special ultra-long-term bonds, though specific figures have not been disclosed.\nAt the national level, China's finances are relatively stable, with a debt-to-GDP ratio of about 68 percent. In comparison, Japan's debt stands at 250 percent, and the US&nbsp;at 120 percent. However, local governments are deeply in debt due to plummeting tax revenues resulting from the property crisis and the pandemic, while spending continues to rise.\nAnalysts suggest that details of the proposed spending plan could emerge during the national legislative session in March.\nEasier Credit to Stimulate Investment\nThis week, the Politburo approved plans for a \"moderately loose\" monetary policy, a shift from the \"prudent\" stance of the last decade. This marks a return to the approach adopted between 2008 and 2010 when the central bank loosened credit aggressively to combat the global financial crisis, according to Tao Wang of UBS.\nEarlier this year, the People's Bank of China began cutting interest rates and reducing the reserve requirements for banks. Further rate cuts are expected in the coming months. Lower interest rates would make it easier to finance housing purchases and other investments, with the central bank playing a larger role in stabilizing markets and boosting the economy.\nAlthough bond prices surged in response to expectations of lower interest rates, investors were disappointed by the lack of specific policy details following the meetings. The Shanghai Composite index fell 2% on Friday, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng dropped 2.1%.\nA Cautious Approach Amid Tariff Uncertainty\nWhile President Xi's long-term vision for a high-quality, innovative economy remains China's guiding framework, policymakers are waiting for clearer direction from the incoming U.S. administration.\nAs the U.S. and other trading partners continue to tighten restrictions on China's access to advanced technologies, Beijing has retaliated with targeted measures. Economists believe that Chinese leaders are taking a cautious approach, reluctant to implement drastic economic changes until they assess the impact of Trump's tariffs.\n\"Chinese authorities have been stuck in a more reactionary policy mode, as the uncertainty of U.S. tariff plans makes it difficult for policymakers to commit to any new major initiatives,\" said Yeap Jun Rong of IG in a report. \"There may still be room for positive surprises, but much will depend on upcoming policy specifics.\"\nTags:\n#International\n#Economy\nKeywords:\nChina economy\nTrade Wars\nTrump Tariffs\nSHARE\nURL berhasil di salin."

    "date": "2024-11-18 01:59:00",
    "content": "With Donald Trump’s return to the White House, we are likely to witness a renewed focus on the \"America First\" policy, which emphasizes reshoring jobs, reducing trade deficits, and tightening immigration policies. Such a stance holds significant implications for emerging economies like Indonesia. Here, we explore the anticipated impacts of Trump’s potential economic policies on the Indonesian economy from 2024 to 2029, specifically in relation to tariffs and trade deficits, the generalized system of preferences (GSP), global supply chain reorientation, and foreign direct investment (FDI).\nFirst, Tariffs and Trade Deficits. During his previous term, Trump employed aggressive tariffs to reduce the US trade deficit, particularly targeting imports from China. In his current term, he has expressed intentions to impose tariffs as high as 60 percent on Chinese imports (and up to 200 percent on electric vehicles), with potential 10-20 percent tariffs on imports from other countries. Such measures could have both direct and indirect repercussions for Indonesia.\nDirectly, Indonesia stands as one of the United States' largest Southeast Asian trading partners after Vietnam, exporting products like palm oil, electronic components, machinery, textiles, footwear, tires, and rubber. In 2023, Indonesia’s exports to the US were valued at $23.3 billion, largely comprised of inputs and raw materials for US production. Increased tariffs on ASEAN countries would raise costs for these products, making Indonesian goods more expensive for US producers and consumers, which could ultimately erode US manufacturing competitiveness and contribute to inflationary pressures.\nIndirectly, any escalation of the US-China trade war -- which has extended to encompass technology, strategic industries, and national security -- would have regional implications, particularly for Southeast Asia. Indonesia, integrated within East Asian supply chains, could be adversely affected if demand decreases for inputs and intermediate goods essential to broader production networks.\nAdvertisement\nSecond, the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP). The GSP program, established in 1976, provides duty-free access to the US market for select goods from developing countries. This preferential treatment benefits Indonesian exports of electronic equipment, travel goods, chemicals, furniture, and rubber. In 2023, Indonesia exported $3.56 billion under GSP.\nTrump’s administration previously removed countries like India and Turkey from GSP eligibility, citing trade imbalances and other concerns. Indonesia has undergone GSP eligibility reviews before, most recently in 2017, as part of the US Trade Representative’s “proactive” process. If Trump reconsiders Indonesia’s GSP status, a suspension or termination of these preferences could increase costs for U.S. companies reliant on Indonesian goods, reducing their competitiveness in global markets and potentially decreasing Indonesia’s exports to the US.\nThird, Global Supply Chain Reorientation. Another core aim of Trump’s economic approach is reshoring manufacturing jobs to the US, reducing reliance on foreign suppliers. This strategy could impact Indonesia’s manufacturing sector, particularly as it relates to electronics and automotive production, where Indonesia has benefited from global production sharing.\nA shift away from Asian supply chains may result in decreased manufacturing demand for Indonesian industries, potentially lowering output and exports in key sectors. However, Indonesia could also benefit from a “China Plus One” strategy, where firms seek alternatives to China but maintain part of their operations in nearby countries. Indonesia’s competitive labor costs, large domestic market, and advantageous position within ASEAN make it an attractive alternative manufacturing hub, albeit with some infrastructure and regulatory challenges.\nFourth, Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). During his previous term, he introduced tax cuts and regulatory incentives designed to encourage US companies to invest domestically. Should a similar approach be implemented in his second term, it could affect US FDI flows to Indonesia. In 2023, FDI from the US into Indonesia totaled $3.3 billion, representing 6.5 percent of total FDI inflows, placing the US fifth after ASEAN, China, Hong Kong, and Japan. US FDI has traditionally been concentrated in sectors such as finance (notably banking and insurance), mining, energy, and consumer goods.\nConcerns exist that Trump’s tax policies could lead to a decline in US FDI abroad if American companies are encouraged to reinvest earnings domestically. Such a shift would impact Indonesian industries reliant on U.S. capital, technology, and expertise.\n&nbsp;\nIn conclusion, a second Trump administration presents both challenges and potential opportunities for Indonesia’s economy. The possibility of heightened tariffs, a GSP review, and a push toward US supply chain reshoring could disrupt trade relations, reduce investment, and require Indonesia to adapt diplomatically and economically.\nMitigating these risks will require Indonesia to diversify its economic partnerships, strengthen local manufacturing, and build trade ties with other major economies to lessen reliance on any single market. Moreover, Indonesia must explore new sources of FDI, potentially increasing investment from China, Japan, South Korea, and the Middle East to compensate for any declines from the US.\nBy building resilience through regional alliances and establishing a robust ASEAN presence, Indonesia can weather shifts in US economic policy and maintain steady growth in an increasingly multipolar world.\n---\nLili Yan Ing is the Secretary General of the International Economic Association (IEA).

Here, we examine the anticipated impacts of Trump’s economic policies on the Southeast Asian economy (grouped as ASEAN), particularly since ASEAN has become an alternative source of imports and a potential destination for investment relocation amid escalating US-China trade tensions. We focus on four key areas: tariffs and trade deficits, the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP), global supply chain reorientation, and foreign direct investment (FDI).&nbsp;\nFirst, Tariffs and Trade Deficits\n&nbsp;\nDuring his previous term, Trump aggressively employed tariffs to reduce the US trade deficit, specifically targeting imports from China. In his second term, he has signaled intentions to impose tariffs as high as 60 percent on Chinese imports, with potential tariffs of 10–20 percent on imports from other countries (and up to 200 percent on electric vehicles, particularly from China and Mexico).\nAdvertisement\nASEAN stands as the fourth-largest trading partner of the US, following Mexico, Canada, and China. The region exports a range of goods to the US, including electronic components, apparel, footwear, and tires, while importing products such as electrical machinery, petroleum oils, soybeans, and aircraft. In 2023, ASEAN’s exports to the US were valued at $269.8 billion, primarily comprising raw materials and assembled goods for US production.&nbsp;\nIf tariffs on ASEAN goods increase, the cost of these imports would rise, making them more expensive for US producers and consumers and potentially reducing US manufacturing competitiveness and adding to inflationary pressures.&nbsp;\nSecond, the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP)\n&nbsp;\nThe GSP program, established in 1976, allows selected goods from developing countries duty-free access to the US market, giving ASEAN countries a competitive advantage. In 2023, ASEAN exports worth $11.7 billion benefited from GSP status, covering 4,867 products (based on HS 6-digit tariff lines), including travel goods, electrical parts, organic chemicals, mattresses, plywood, and tires. ASEAN beneficiaries currently include Cambodia, Myanmar, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Thailand, while Malaysia has been excluded from the program since 1998.&nbsp;\nDuring Trump's first term in 2017, his administration removed countries like India and Turkey from GSP eligibility, citing trade imbalances and other concerns. At the same time, among ASEAN countries, Thailand and Indonesia were subject to GSP eligibility reviews and were asked to expand market access for US goods and services (note for us: this request contradicted Article 5 of the 1979 Tokyo Agreement, which prohibits developed countries from demanding market access from GSP recipient countries).&nbsp;\nShould Trump re-evaluate Thailand’s and Indonesia’s GSP status, a suspension or termination could increase costs for US companies reliant on ASEAN exports. Since nearly 60 percent of ASEAN’s GSP exports come from Thailand and Indonesia, losing GSP benefits could reduce ASEAN’s overall exports to the US.&nbsp;\nIt’s worth noting that many of these ASEAN exports are essential inputs for US production and exports; thus, a GSP termination would likely raise U.S. domestic prices (inflation) and erode US export competitiveness.&nbsp;\nThird, Global Supply Chain Reorientation\n&nbsp;\nAnother major focus of Trump’s economic strategy will be to encourage US companies to reshore manufacturing, thereby reducing reliance on foreign suppliers. This shift could decrease demand for ASEAN’s manufacturing output, particularly in electronics, textiles, and automotive industries, impacting production and exports. However, ASEAN could benefit from a “China Plus One” strategy, where firms retain part of their operations in China but relocate other parts to nearby countries.&nbsp;\nWith competitive labor costs, a large domestic market, and a strategic position, ASEAN remains an attractive manufacturing hub, albeit with some infrastructure and regulatory challenges. The escalation of US-China trade tensions -- now extending into technology, strategic industries, and national security -- will have significant implications for Southeast Asia, which is deeply integrated into East Asian supply chains.&nbsp;\nGiven ASEAN's role in supplying inputs and intermediate goods for broader production networks in textiles, semiconductors, telecommunications, electrical equipment, machinery, computers, and automotive industries, the region could face reduced demand if reshoring leads to a drop in production and export requirements in these networks.&nbsp;\nFourth, Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)\n&nbsp;\nDuring Trump’s first term, he implemented tax cuts and regulatory incentives to encourage American companies to invest domestically. Should he adopt similar policies in his second term, US FDI flows to ASEAN may decline. In 2023, US FDI into ASEAN totaled $74.36 billion, accounting for 32.35 percent of total FDI inflows and making the US ASEAN’s largest FDI source. US investments in the region have been primarily concentrated in finance (including banking and insurance), professional and technical services, manufacturing, information and communication, and real estate.&nbsp;\nThere are concerns that Trump’s tax policies could further discourage US FDI abroad by incentivizing American companies to reinvest earnings domestically. This shift could significantly impact ASEAN industries that rely on partnerships with US capital, technology, and expertise, particularly in finance, energy, mining, and pharmaceuticals.&nbsp;\nIn conclusion, a second Trump administration presents both challenges and potential opportunities for the ASEAN economy. The potential for increased tariffs, a GSP review, and a push toward US supply chain reshoring could disrupt trade relations, reduce investment, and require ASEAN to adapt diplomatically and economically.&nbsp;\nTo mitigate these risks, ASEAN could focus on diversifying its economic partnerships, strengthening local manufacturing, and expanding trade ties with other major economies to reduce dependency on any single market. Additionally, ASEAN might adopt a direct business-to-business approach to attract US investment while exploring new FDI sources. This could include increased investment from the EU, China, Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and the Middle East to offset any potential declines from the US. By enhancing regional cooperation and establishing a more robust economic presence, ASEAN would be better positioned to withstand shifts in US economic policy, ensuring stability and continued growth in an increasingly multipolar world.\n---\nLili Yan Ing is the Secretary General of the International Economic Association (IEA).

    "content": "Washington.\nPresident-elect Donald Trump stunned the Pentagon and the broader defense world by nominating Fox News host Pete Hegseth to serve as his defense secretary, tapping someone largely inexperienced and untested on the global stage to take over the world's largest and most powerful military.\nThe news was met with bewilderment and worry among many in Washington as Trump passed on a number of established national security heavy-hitters and chose an Army National Guard officer well known in conservative circles as a co-host of Fox News Channel’s “Fox &amp; Friends Weekend.”\nWhile some Republican lawmakers had a muted response to the announcement, others called his combat experience an asset or said he was “tremendously capable.”\nHegseth's choice could bring sweeping changes to the military. He has made it clear on his show and in interviews that, like Trump, he is opposed to “woke” programs that promote equity and inclusion. He also has questioned the role of women in combat and advocated pardoning service members charged with war crimes.\nAdvertisement\nIn June, at a rally in Las Vegas, Trump encouraged his supporters to buy Hegseth’s book and said that if he won the presidency, \"The woke stuff will be gone within a period of 24 hours. I can tell you.”\nThe 44-year-old Hegseth, a staunch conservative who embraces Trump's “America First” policies, has pushed for making the military more lethal. During an interview on “The Shawn Ryan Show” podcast, he said allowing women to serve in combat hurts that effort.\n“Everything about men and women serving together makes the situation more complicated, and complication in combat, that means casualties are worse,” Hegseth said.\nAnd while he said diversity in the military is a strength, he said it was because minority and white men can perform similarly but the same isn't true for women.\nBy opening combat slots to women, “we’ve changed the standards in putting them there, which means you’ve changed the capability of that unit,” Hegseth said in the podcast interview.\nSince then-Defense Secretary Ash Carter opened all combat roles to women in 2016, women have successfully passed the military's grueling tests to become Green Berets and Army Rangers, and the Naval Special Warfare's test to serve as a combatant-craft crewman — the boat operators who transport Navy SEALs and conduct their own classified missions at sea.\nWhile Trump lauded Hegseth as “tough, smart and a true believer in America First,” others were quick to point to the TV personality's lack of experience. Some suggested he could be Pentagon chief in name only as the Trump White House runs the department.\nA number of other names floated as possible defense choices had included Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Ala., chairman of the House Armed Services Committee; retired Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg; Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa; and Robert Wilkie, a former Pentagon official who was head of the Department of Veterans Affairs in Trump's first term.\n“There is reason for concern that this is not a person who is a serious enough policymaker, serious enough policy implementer, to do a successful job,” said Rep. Adam Smith of Washington, the ranking Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee.\nMark Cancian, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said Hegseth's lack of senior national security experience makes it more difficult to get Senate confirmation.\n“I think Trump was tired of fighting with his secretaries of defense and picked one who would be loyal to him,” Cancian said.\nMilitary officials said the choice came out of the blue. A senior military officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the media, said Hegseth's selection is raising concerns about whether he has the practical experience to manage a large department with an enormous budget.\nThe Defense Department has a budget exceeding $800 billion, with about 1.3 million active-duty troops and another 1.4 million in the National Guard, Reserves and civilian employees based worldwide.\nIf confirmed, Hegseth would face a daunting array of global crises, from the wars in the Middle East and Ukraine and the expanding alliance between Russia and North Korea to the growing competition with China. There is also the need to upgrade the complex US missile and nuclear defense apparatus and ensure the defense industry can keep up with America's need for weapons systems.\nSmith said that while Hegseth's combat experience is a plus, running the Pentagon requires a lot of other skill sets, and his nomination will need some time for consideration.\n“What’s your plan? What are you going to do? ... How can you assure us that that lack of experience, you know, isn’t going to make it impossible for you to do the job?” Smith said. “I think those are questions that need to be answered over the next couple of months.”\nEven some Republicans in the Senate, who would vote on his nomination, had a subdued response.\nNorth Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis called the choice “interesting.” Indiana Sen. Todd Young, who served in the Marine Corps, said, “I don’t know much about his background or his vision, so I look forward to learning more.”\nNorth Dakota Sen. John Hoeven said he’s not surprised that Trump chose Hegseth because Trump is “close to him and likes him and trusts him.”\n“The guy’s obviously tremendously capable, a great communicator,\" Hoeven said. \"I look forward to getting to know him better.”\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said Hegseth brings a lot to the table and will be \"reform-minded in the areas that need reform.”\nHegseth has been a contributor since 2014 for Fox News, developing a friendship with Trump, who made regular appearances on his show. He is the author of “The War on Warriors: Behind the Betrayal of the Men Who Keep Us Free.”\n“With Pete at the helm, America’s enemies are on notice — Our Military will be Great Again, and America will Never Back Down,” Trump said in a statement. “Nobody fights harder for the Troops, and Pete will be a courageous and patriotic champion of our ‘Peace through Strength’ policy.”\nTags:\n#International\nKeywords:\nPete Hegseth\nUS Defense Secretary\nDonald Trump Presidency\nDonald Trump\nUS politics\nSHARE\nURL berhasil di salin."

    "content": "Jakarta.\nIndonesian nickel and batteries might have a better chance of penetrating the American market should president hopeful Kamala Harris win the upcoming US election, according to a senior economist.&nbsp;\nBut a Harris government might only grant entry for Indonesian nickel if it met its green standards, Bhima Yudhistira, the executive director at the economic think-tank Celios, said Tuesday.&nbsp;\nIn 2022, the incumbent US President Joe Biden inked the so-called Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) into law; a climate policy that reduces the taxes that Americans have to pay when purchasing electric vehicles (EVs). However, an EV is only eligible for tax credits if made from minerals from the US or its free trade agreements partners. Indonesia does not have a trade pact with the US but has been pursuing what it calls a limited critical mineral agreement so batteries made from its nickel can benefit from the tax credits.\nIn just a few hours from now, Americans will have to choose between Former President Donald Trump and the current veep Harris to be their next leader.\nAdvertisement\nThe moments counting down to the election also spark questions on what will happen to Indonesia’s pursuit of having its nickel enter the US market when the White House installs a new president.&nbsp;\nTrump plans to revoke any unspent funds from the IRA, and this could spell bad news for Indonesian nickel, according to Bhima.&nbsp;\n“Trump’s promise of terminating or delaying the IRA can take a toll on Indonesian nickel’s access to the US market. … A Harris election victory means that goods processed from Indonesian nickel can diversify its markets beyond China. Of course, this will lead to [Indonesian nickel] being sold at a better price. But this is only possible if Indonesia produces green-premium nickel,” Bhima told the Jakarta Globe on Tuesday.&nbsp;\nBhima expects to see the IRA continuing under a Harris administration, saying that the US Democratic Party sees the climate law as a stimulus for both the economy and energy transition. The analyst added: “Harris will continue the IRA policies, especially follow-ups on US deals, including helping Indonesia improve its [nickel] supply chain, traceability, environmental and social governance.”\nIndonesia, however, still has a lot of things to fix before the country can produce premium green nickel that the Harris government might accept. Bhima told the Globe that Indonesia had proposed 14.4 gigawatts of captive coal capacity to power its critical mineral smelters. Bhima attributed Indonesia’s sluggish approach to adopting sustainability principles to the attitude of its top nickel buyer China.\n“Chinese buyers are not nudging [Indonesia] into implementing more stringent ESG [environmental, social, and governance] standards,” Bhima said.\nFILE - Republican presidential nominee former President Donald Trump watches as Democratic presidential nominee Vice President Kamala Harris speaks during an ABC News presidential debate, Sept. 10, 2024, in Philadelphia. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon, File)\nBoth Indonesia and the US are witnessing a transition of power.\nFormer army general Prabowo Subianto recently rose to power after securing a landslide victory. Biden has congratulated Prabowo on his inauguration, saying that he was looking forward to bolstering ties with the new administration.&nbsp;\nPrabowo is scheduled to fly to the US later this month as part of his first-ever foreign trip as president. According to State-Owned Enterprise Minister Erick Thohir, Prabowo would try to give an extra push for American carmaker Ford to make an investment in Indonesia.&nbsp;\n“Regarding Mr. President [upcoming] overseas tour, I have told Foreign Minister [Sugiono] to include this on [Prabowo’s] agenda … for the president to start the discussions on pushing for Ford Motor Company’s investments in Indonesia. … Indonesia wants to play a role in the global EV battery supply chain,” Erick told the country’s lawmakers in Jakarta on Monday.\nUnder the preceding Joko “Jokowi” Widodo government, Indonesia-US upgraded its ties to a comprehensive strategic partnership (CSP) when the former Jakarta governor visited Biden at the White House last November. It was also then that the US agreed to develop an action plan that would possibly culminate in the negotiations of a bilateral critical mineral deal. The two leaders also vowed to work together towards a low-emission mineral supply chain.&nbsp;\nIndonesia hosts the world’s largest nickel reserves. The 2024 US Geological Survey report shows Indonesia has 55 million metric tons in nickel reserves, seconded by Australia (24 million metric tons).\nTags:\n#Commodity\n#Bilateral\nKeywords:\nKamala Harris\nDonald Trump\nKamala Harris vs Donald Trump\nUS election\nIndonesia-US Ties\nJoe Biden\nIndonesian Nickel\nInflation Reduction Act\nUS IRA Policy\nPrabowo Subianto\nJokowi Meets Biden\nEV Investment\nelectric vehicles\nIndonesia-US Comprehensive Strategic Partnership\nSHARE\nURL berhasil di salin."

The government has confirmed Prabowo’s attendance at the Peru forum of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)&nbsp; -- another alliance that the US is part of. The newly inaugurated president will&nbsp;stop by China and the US to meet their respective leaders -- Xi Jinping and Joe Biden -- before coming to the said multilateral fora.&nbsp;\nAccording to State-Owned Enterprise Minister Erick Thohir, Prabowo is set to give an extra push for Indonesia’s goal of developing its electric vehicle (EV) ecosystem when he travels abroad.\nAdvertisement\n“Regarding Mr. President [upcoming] overseas tour, I have told Foreign Minister [Sugiono] to include this on [Prabowo’s] agenda … for the president to start the discussions on pushing for Ford Motor Company’s investments in Indonesia. The same goes for Volkswagen,” Erick told the country’s lawmakers during a hearing session in Jakarta.\n“Indonesia wants to play a role in the global EV battery supply chain,” Erick said.\nNickel miner Vale has partnered with Ford and Chinese cobalt supplier Huayou to build a $4.5 billion nickel processing plant in Kolaka, Southeast Sulawesi. According to media reports, Vale was seeking to work with Volkswagen for the high-pressure acid leach facility -- which extracts valuable metals from laterite ores -- in the South Sulawesi village of Sorowako. The Indonesian government has a 34 percent stake in Vale via the state mining holding company: MIND ID.\nAttracting foreign investors has been a huge part of Indonesia’s grand plan for mining industrialization. Since 2020, Indonesia has stopped exporting unprocessed nickel ores in favor of producing semi-finished or finished goods at home. This way, the nickel-abundant country can ship out goods that can give a bigger boost to the economy. The import restrictions on nickel -- a mainstay ingredient in EV battery manufacturing -- also aim to nudge global carmakers and battery producers into setting up their production plants in Indonesia.&nbsp;\nThis strategy of having Indonesia move up the EV value chain was an integral part of the former Joko “Jokowi” Widodo government’s economic policies.

    "content": "Jakarta.\nIndonesia’s “partner country” status to BRICS means that Jakarta is undergoing a probation period before it can finally become an official member,&nbsp; according to a Russian diplomat.\nThe newly established Prabowo Subianto government recently announced that Indonesia would pursue a seat at BRICS. Just a few days ago, BRICS -- whose members include China and Russia -- made Indonesia as one of its “partner countries” at its Kazan summit. Russian Ambassador to Indonesia Sergei Tolchenov said Monday that any nation wishing to join BRICS now had to gain the “partner country” status first. This probation-like process lets BRICS members see whether they are fit to be part of the alliance.\n“The [partner country] status is an intermediate step [before a state] can become a full-fledged member,” Tolcheno told the press in Jakarta.\nBRICS initially brought together Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa, hence its name. BRICS later welcomed new members Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Saudi Arabia has yet to formalize its membership despite having received the invitation to join. President Prabowo sent Foreign Minister Sugiono to attend the Kazan Summit on the latter’s first overseas ministerial trip. It was also then that Sugiono unveiled Indonesia’s intent to join BRICS.&nbsp; Tolchenov said that the partner country mechanism would make it easier for the now-enlarged alliance to make decisions on new memberships.&nbsp;\nAdvertisement\n“[The process of accepting] full-fledged members has become more complicated. BRICS now have to accommodate the activities within the framework of 10 countries, not the 5 initial countries. That’s why BRICS decided to introduce the option of countries becoming a partner state [with hopes] they can eventually be full members,” Tolchenov said.\nAccording to Tolchenov, the entire partner country process also does not have a specific timetable or deadline.\nRussian Ambassador to Indonesia Sergei Tolchenov holds a press conference in Jakarta on Oct. 28, 2024. (JG Photo/Jayanty Nada Shofa)\nIndonesia’s pursuit of a BRICS membership became the first major diplomatic move out of the nascent Prabowo government. This also marked quite a development, considering that Indonesia under former President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo was still weighing the pros and cons of joining BRICS. Indonesia to date has not set a target when they were aiming to get admitted to BRICS. Sugiono at the time said that Indonesia’s membership bid could give Indonesia more room to promote the interests of the so-called Global South, a term that commonly refers to developing nations.\n“It’s my pleasure as the special envoy of the Indonesian president to announce Indonesia’s intention to join BRICS and become its member. By doing so, Indonesia will be able to better support BRICS’ efforts to advance the causes and interests of the Global South. And also while contributing to the maintenance of a world order based on freedom, lasting peace, and social justice,” Sugiono told the Kazan summit on Friday.\nIn a press statement, Sugiono said that the BRICS membership did not mean Indonesia is changing its long-standing “free and active” foreign policy of not taking sides. Sugiono said that BRICS’ priorities -- such as food security and poverty eradication -- were in line with the programs under Prabowo’s Merah Putih (“Red and White”) cabinet.&nbsp;\nTags:\n#International\nKeywords:\nBRICS\nIndonesia Joins Brics\nIndonesia BRICS Membership\nSergei Tolchenov\nSugiono\nPrabowo Subianto\nIndonesia in BRICS\nBRICS Kazan Summit\nSHARE\nURL berhasil di salin."

It has admitted new members Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia, and the United Arab Emirates. Saudi Arabia has yet to officially join BRICS despite having received the invitation from the group.&nbsp;\nForeign Affairs Minister Sugiono unveiled Indonesia’s desire for membership at the BRICS Plus Summit in Russia’s Kazan on Thursday local time. According to Sugiono, BRICS can become a vehicle to promote the interests of the “Global South”, a term that commonly refers to developing countries. Jakarta also denies that its possible BRICS membership means that it is taking sides,&nbsp;saying that it will continue to engage with other forums and advanced economies.&nbsp;\n“Indonesia joining BRICS embodies the country’s active and free foreign policy,” Sugiono said in a press statement issued on Thursday night.&nbsp;\nAdvertisement\n“It does not mean that we are joining a certain camp, but we actively participate in all forums. We see that BRICS priorities align with the Red and White&nbsp;Cabinet work programs. And that includes food and energy security, poverty eradication, as well as human capital development,” Sugiono said.\nSugiono’s statement came shortly after reports revealed that Indonesia was among BRICS’ 13 new partner countries. Three of them are fellow ASEAN members Malaysia, Vietnam, and Thailand. The partner country status does not mean they are full-fledged members.&nbsp;\nThe BRICS gathering came out with the Kazan declaration. The document stated that the summit welcomed the “considerable interest” by Global South countries in BRICS, while also endorsing what it calls “the modalities of partner country category”.\n“We strongly believe that extending the BRICS partnership with EMDCs [emerging market and developing countries] will further contribute to strengthening the spirit of solidarity and true international cooperation for the benefit of all,” the Kazan declaration reads.\nJakarta’s intention to join BRICS became the first outcome of Prabowo’s so-called “good neighbor foreign policy”. When Prabowo took over as president over the weekend, the former army general said he wanted Indonesia to be friends with all countries, while keeping an anti-colonialism stance.\nIndonesia previously chose to not rush with a BRICS membership under Former President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo. Last year, Jokowi flew to the BRICS Summit in Johannesburg as the rotating ASEAN chair. Jokowi said at the time Indonesia would like to weigh the pros and cons first before formally applying to BRICS. Analyst Yose Rizal Damuri said at the time that it would be best for Indonesia to not rush into joining the group, citing the group’s lack of clear economic benefits as a reason.&nbsp;\nTags:\n#International\nKeywords:\nBRICS\nIndonesia in BRICS\nSugiono\nForeign Affairs Minister Sugiono\njokowi\nPrabowo Subianto\nGood Neighbor Foreign Policy\nIndonesian diplomacy\nSHARE\nURL berhasil di salin."

    "content": "Jakarta.\nWhen it comes to navigating international relations, there is no better option than the “free and active” policy that Indonesia has always adopted, according to Foreign Affairs Minister Retno Marsudi.\nIndonesia has embraced what it calls the “free and active foreign policy” since the country’s earliest days. This approach sees Indonesia free to make friends with anyone, but at the same time, Jakarta does not feel obliged to join any particular bloc. This decades-long stance remains unchanged for Southeast Asia’s largest economy, even including throughout the past 10 years of Indonesia’s outgoing leader Joko “Jokowi” Widodo's leadership. Retno -- who has accompanied Jokowi as his foreign minister since 2014 -- recently looked back on Indonesia’s interactions on the global stage under Jokowi.\n“Many people have asked us whether Indonesia’s free and active foreign policy remains relevant to this day, and I would ask them back, ‘are there any better options?'” Retno said in an exclusive interview aired by BTV on Thursday evening.\n“Indonesia is free to befriend anyone as long as that friendship is mutually beneficial and brings benefits to the country. This gives us a wide space to maneuver as we make our contributions. Imagine if we are tied to an alliance, our position has to follow the group even though it goes against what we believe in,” Retno said.\nAdvertisement\nAccording to the senior diplomat, this free and active policy had become “more relevant” amidst today’s geopolitical tensions. She added: “I remember Mr. President [Jokowi] once said that Indonesia would befriend anyone, but we cannot be dictated by others.”\nPresident Joko \"Jokowi\" Widodo and his American counterpart Joe Biden laugh together during the former's visit to the White House in Washington on Nov. 13, 2023. (Photo Courtesy of Presidential Press Bureau)\nIt appears that Indonesia’s decision to not pick sides has bore fruit. A case in point is that Indonesia is still trading with two rivaling major powers, the US and China. Despite Jakarta growing closer economic ties with China, the US still sees Indonesia as a close partner. Last year, Indonesia-US decided to elevate their ties to the level of a comprehensive strategic partnership.\nThe unchanging political ethos lets Indonesia take part in cooling down the aftermath of the Russia-Ukraine war. In 2022, Jokowi headed to the two warring countries to meet their respective leaders: Russia’s Vladimir Putin and Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Jokowi at the time promised to Zelenskyy that he would deliver Kyiv’s message to Putin, whom he met not long after. The ex-Jakarta governor took the opportunity to bring both countries’ attention to how the war had disrupted the global food supply chain. Ukraine is a major wheat supplier. Russia’s blockades of Ukraine’s Black Sea ports have taken a toll on food markets.\nSince being declared the election winner, Jokowi’s successor, Prabowo Subianto, has toured around the globe to introduce himself to world leaders as the incoming president. The former army general has said that he intends to also have Indonesia befriend anyone, saying that “a thousand friends are too few, but one enemy is too many”. &nbsp;\nPresident Joko 'Jokowi' Widodo meets with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the Mariinsky Palace in Kyiv on June 29, 2022.

Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati has projected Indonesia's economic growth to reach 5.1 percent&nbsp;by the end of 2024, slightly below the 5.2 percent&nbsp;target outlined in the 2024 state budget, but higher than the 5.05 percent recorded in 2023.\nAccording to Sri Mulyani, the upcoming 2024 Regional Election in November is expected to boost household consumption, a major contributor to national economic growth. Additionally, the festive season in the fourth quarter, including Christmas and New Year celebrations, will further enhance consumer spending.\n“During national holidays, we typically see increased mobility, which positively contributes to consumption in our economy,” she said in a press conference following the Financial Stability Committee's (KSSK) quarterly meeting at Bank Indonesia on Friday.\nThe Central Statistics Agency (BPS) reported that Indonesia's economic growth for the second quarter of 2024 reached 5.05 percent. Meanwhile, the World Bank has upgraded its forecast for Indonesia's gross domestic product (GDP) growth, projecting an average of 5.1 percent&nbsp;per year from 2024 to 2026. This revision marks an increase from the previous projection of 4.9 percent&nbsp;for both 2024 and 2025.\nAdvertisement\nFrom a production standpoint, the manufacturing and trade sectors are anticipated to support national economic growth, aided by stable purchasing power, low inflation, and increased productivity. Sri Mulyani assured that government policies aimed at maintaining purchasing power and price stability will continue, alongside social protection programs crucial for economic activity.\nThe KSSK reported stable financial system conditions in the third quarter of 2024, reflecting eased pressures in global financial markets following monetary policy easing by developed nations. Despite this relief, the committee remains vigilant against potential external economic shocks that could impact Indonesia's economy.\nSri Mulyani highlighted the uncertainty in global financial markets due to the recent easing of monetary policies by major economies, particularly as inflationary pressures begin to subside. The US&nbsp;Federal Reserve cut its benchmark interest rate for the first time since the Covid-19 pandemic in September 2024, reducing the rate to a range of 4.75 percent to 5 percent. More cuts are expected to follow.\nThis decision positively impacted the yield on US&nbsp;Treasury bonds, with the two-year yield falling below that of ten-year bonds, marking a shift in bond market dynamics. Furthermore, both the European Central Bank and China's People's Bank of China have also lowered their benchmark rates, reducing uncertainty in global financial markets and facilitating capital flows from developed to emerging markets, including Indonesia.\n“The era of higher interest rates is waning, leading to increased foreign capital inflows into emerging markets, including Indonesia,” Sri Mulyani said, indicating a positive trend for the country’s economic outlook.\nTags:\n#Economy\nKeywords:\nSri Mulyani\neconomic growth\nIndonesia GDP\nKSSK\nSHARE\nURL berhasil di salin."

Bank Indonesia (BI) has decided to maintain its benchmark interest rate (BI Rate) at 6 percent, the deposit facility rate at 5.25 percent, and the lending facility rate at 6.75 percent&nbsp;during its Board of Governors Meeting on Wednesday.\nGovernor Perry Warjiyo said that this decision aligns with the monetary policy direction aimed at ensuring inflation remains within the target range of 2.5 percent&nbsp;for 2024 and 2025 while promoting sustainable economic growth. He emphasized the importance of stabilizing the exchange rate of the rupiah due to increasing uncertainties in global financial markets.\n“Moving forward, BI will continue to assess the potential for interest rate reductions while considering inflation projections, the exchange rate of the rupiah, and economic growth,” Perry Warjiyo said.\nBI is also reinforcing its monetary, macroprudential, and payment system policies to maintain stability and support sustainable economic growth. The central bank continues to implement macroprudential measures to encourage banking credit financing for priority sectors such as small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and green economy initiatives while adhering to prudential principles.\nAdvertisement\nPreviously, economist Teuku Riefky from the think tank LPEM FEB University of Indonesia anticipated that BI would maintain the benchmark interest rate at 6 percent&nbsp;during the Board of Governors Meeting on October 15-16, 2024. Despite a deflationary trend observed over the past five months, BI is expected to keep the rate steady.\nBoth BI and the Federal Reserve began an era of monetary easing in September 2024. Additionally, rising global geopolitical tensions, China's stimulus program, and the upcoming US&nbsp;elections are factors influencing foreign capital flows into Indonesia and fluctuations in the rupiah's exchange rate in the near future.\n“Any potential for further policy cuts should be reserved to address the risk of prolonged deflationary trends,” Riefky said.\nTags:\n#Economy\nKeywords:\nBank Indonesia\nBI Rate\nBI 7DRRR\nSHARE\nURL berhasil di salin."

    "content": "Jakarta.\nThe smooth transition of power was evident at Indonesia’s largest investment forum: the 2024 BNI Investor Daily Summit.\nThe two-day forum took place on Oct. 8-9 -- a timing that could not be more perfect. It was less than two weeks away before President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo passed the baton to his successor Prabowo Subianto. Jokowi opened the 2024 BNI Investor Daily Summit with a speech on how one needs to be optimistic about Indonesia’s economic potential. Prabowo became the last act in the event by delivering a vision statement that gave the audience some insights to his future economic policies.&nbsp;\nThe annual BNI Investor Daily Summit tackled the theme of “Accelerating Resilient Growth”. The incumbent Jokowi has high hopes for Indonesia’s economy. Jokowi told the forum that he was upbeat about Indonesia becoming one of the new economic superpowers alongside India and China as the world’s growth shifts from the West to Asia.\n“Optimism is key. We must not be trapped in pessimism because of the global uncertainties and the ongoing geopolitical tensions,” Jokowi said in his opening remarks.\nAdvertisement\nTo Jokowi, digital transformation is key to making Indonesia more competitive. He underlined the importance of building the country’s digital infrastructure, including data centers, digital payment systems, and digital analyses to support these transformations. And of course, Jokowi reminded the audience that Indonesia would not budge on its resource nationalism. This is a policy in which the resource-rich Indonesia banned exports of unprocessed nickel to produce goods of higher value at home and foster domestic industries. The resource nationalism so far has been centered on the mining industry, but Jokowi said that plans were underway to expand this domestic processing into non-mining commodities including coffee and seaweed.\n\"We must dare to take our own path. Don't just follow global trends that sometimes bring us into tough competition, because we have our own strengths and core competencies that we must take advantage of,\" he said.\nPresident Joko 'Jokowi' Widodo launches the 2024 BNI Investor Daily Summit in Jakarta on Oct. 8, 2024. (B Universe Photo/Joanito de Saojao)\nThe economy has been growing at around 5 percent. Prabowo -- who has promised continuity of Jokowi’s existing policies -- is upbeat about unlocking an 8 percent growth within his first three years of presidency. As Indonesia inches closer to the inauguration on Oct. 20, curiosity on whether Prabowo can achieve the ambitious target grows. Some even say that an 8-percent growth is too ambitious for the current defense minister. Prabowo took the opportunity to respond to the criticisms in front of senior government officials and business representatives, even quoting Indonesia’s founding father Soekarno.&nbsp;\n“They often mocked me for wanting 8 percent growth, but that’s okay. … Remember what Soekarno said: ‘Dream as high as the sky. So if you fall, you will fall among the stars. I dream of 8 percent growth, if I fail, then it can drop to 7.5 or even 7 percent. If we are satisfied, then we can aim for 6 percent. If we end up with a 5.3 percent growth rate, that's alright,” Prabowo told the BNI Investor Daily Summit.\nHe added: “Perhaps if not 8 percent, our economy will expand by 9 percent. Don’t believe it? Just wait and see.”\nPrabowo even set another ambitious goal of having Indonesia be self-sufficient in food within his four years of presidency. Prabowo said that an independent country would not rely on imported food. The same goes for energy. Indonesia is eyeing to increase the palm oil blend of its biodiesel fuel to cut diesel oil imports. Last but not least is the continuity of Jokowi’s domestic processing policy.&nbsp;\nPrabowo also said that Indonesia should not rely on the so-called “trickle-down economics”, namely policies that favor the rich and corporations in hopes that the benefits will eventually trickle down to everyone else, particularly the less fortunate. An example is granting large corporation tax cuts in hopes that the companies use the money for business expansions which will eventually lead to job generation. To Prabowo, Indonesia should push for an economic approach that benefits everyone in the country that boasts a population of 280 million people.\n“We have to be brave to fix our system. We have to ask ourselves what we can do to make sure that Indonesia’s wealth is fairly distributed to all, not just a small number of people. We cannot rely on trickle-down economics. It is too slow,” Prabowo said.\nThe Fruits of Jokowi’s 10-Year Presidency\nPrabowo’s upcoming inauguration will mark the end of Jokowi’s presidency. The businessman-turned-politician has led the country for the past 10 years since 2014. Jokowi’s leadership is synonymous with infrastructure development.&nbsp;\nAccording to Finance Minister Sri Mulyani, the amount of public money that the government set aside for infrastructure had been growing significantly over the years. The government allocated around Rp 423.4 trillion ($27.2 billion) for infrastructure development this year, marking a threefold jump compared to the Rp 157 trillion budget in 2014. Sri Mulyani -- who reportedly would return as a finance minister under Prabowo’s government -- also told the 2024 BNI Investor Daily Summit that human capital was also key for resilient growth. Human capital development through education and social protection is also key to getting Indonesia out of the middle income trap.\n“If we take a look at the past 10 years, there have been incredible challenges such as the pandemic, the geopolitical prices, commodity prices, global inflation, the worst rate hike in 40 years. But even so, Indonesia has been able to maintain its growth and state budget health. This is an incredible achievement,” Sri Mulyani said at the 2024 BNI Investor Daily Summit.\nPresident Joko Widodo, second left, is welcomed by B-Universe Executive Chairman Enggartiasto Lukita, BNI President Director Royke Tumilaar, and Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati during the BNI Investor Daily Summit at the Jakarta Convention Center, Tuesday, Oct. 8, 2024. (David Gita Roza)\nAccording to Investment Minister Rosan Roeslani, Jokowi has done a great job in keeping the economy stable at around 5 percent over the past decade, thus making Indonesia a popular destination for foreign investors.&nbsp;\n“We have to maintain the peace and stability because those are the main reasons why investors decide to invest in Indonesia,” Rosan said.&nbsp;\nAs of the first half, Indonesia has achieved 50.3 percent of its annual investment target. The country aims to attract Rp 1,650 trillion from foreign and domestic investors. Indonesia also has a series of strategic projects that it has been promoting to investors. That includes the new capital project of Nusantara, which has caught the attention of a number of international institutions. As a case in point, Russia’s Magnum Real Estate International already began the construction of a mix-use residential project worth up to Rp 500 billion. More foreign investors are set to come.\n“We are in the process of selecting that every investment that comes here is of quality,” Rosan said.\nNo Time to Catch Breath\nJokowi does not want Prabowo to waste a single second after he takes office. Jokowi admitted that he had around one and a half years trying to put everything together when he first assumed his role in 2014. Jokowi even told the high-profile forum that Prabowo never missed any meeting ever since his election victory, thus proving that he was willing to spare no effort to prepare for his government. Finance Minister Sri Mulyani also revealed that her ministry continued to communicate with Prabowo regarding the 2025 state budget.\n“We continue to be in talks with the president-elect so the state budget can accommodate his upcoming programs. This will cut the time needed for the transition, so we can keep up this momentum of growth,” Sri Mulyani said.\nMeanwhile, president-elect Prabowo Subianto also admitted that the government transition process this time went very smoothly. According to him, the smoothness was thanks to the assistance of President Jokowi. Prabowo also said that he would invite members of the Advanced Indonesia Cabinet to the next government cabinet.\n\"In this transition, I feel very helped, very supported by Mr. Jokowi and his team. In fact, when I was compiling the cabinet, I saw that many ministers who will come are also in the current cabinet,\" he said.\n\"I think what is happening now, I feel and I think is felt by many parties, is a transition that can be said to be a very smooth transition, very easy,\" he added.\nSmooth Transition\nThe presence of both the outgoing and incoming leaders in one forum shows that the government transition is going well.\n“I don’t think there has been an investment forum or a forum hosted by the media that was opened by an outgoing president and closed with a vision statement from the incoming president,” B-Universe’s Executive Chairman Enggartiasto said.\nThe ex-trade minister added: “We can see that the government transition is going smoothly, and there is a continuity [of existing policies]. We can also feel the camaraderie. This becomes a positive signal for the domestic and international market.”\nLikewise, BNI President Director Royke Tumilaar said that the forum could become a platform for government officials alike to reveal what Indonesia has in mind to promote its growth.\n“The 2024 BNI Investor Daily Summit becomes an important moment for investors and businesses to see how Indonesia will perform in the future,” Royke said.\nSurveys show that the public are optimistic about Prabowo’s upcoming administration. A survey by Indikator Politik Indonesia shows that Prabowo gained an 83.4 percent approval rating. Respondents believe that the former army general can make Indonesia even better.&nbsp;\nPresident Joko Widodo, right, hosts a meeting with President-elect Prabowo Subianto at his private residence in Solo, Central Java, Sunday, Oct. 13, 2024. (Photo is taken from the @jokowi X account)\nSarman Simanjorang, a senior official at the Indonesian Employers Association (Apindo), said that this was the most conducive power transition in Indonesia’s history, thus giving businesses the certainty they need that the existing policies will remain. Prabowo’s current role as the defense minister is also another hint to the continuity.\n“Businesses do not see any drastic changes [from Jokowi to Prabowo]. We believe that Prabowo will continue Jokowi’s policies. We have seen Prabowo often saying that he is part of the Jokowi government,” Sarman said.\nMuhammad Anwar, a researcher from the think-tank Ideas, said that Jokowi’s massive infrastructure development and various social assistance programs had provided significant benefits for the poor. While Prabowo is likely to carry on these programs, the incoming leader should pay attention to how he handles policies related to subsidies.\nPolitical analyst Ujang Komarudin said that Prabowo had been moving fast as he worked to establish his ministerial cabinet, be it from political leaders or experts. A government that runs like a well-oiled machine is necessary amidst the growing global uncertainties. Ujang said: “Prabowo wants to form a dream team that can support him.”\nPrabowo -- alongside his vice president-elect Gibran Rakabuming Raka -- will take their oath of office on Oct. 20. On Monday, Prabowo called many of his ministerial candidates, some of whom are Jokowi’s existing ministers, to his Kertanegara residence. This includes Sri Mulyani as well as National Mandate Party (PAN) chair and Trade Minister Zulkifli Hasan. Rosan Roeslani also got summoned by Prabowo. The presence of Jokowi’s ministers in the future government ensures the continuity of Jokowi’s programs.\n__\nB-Universe journalists Arnoldus Kristianus, Djibril Muhammad, Hendro Dahlan Situmorang, Imam Suhartadi, Indah Handayani, Jayanty Nada Shofa, Nida Sahara, and Tri Listiyarini also contributed to this story.\nTags:\n#Economy\n#10 Years of Jokowi\nKeywords:\nPrabowo Subianto\njokowi\nGovernment Transition\n2024 BNI Investor Daily Summit\nIndonesian economy\nSHARE\nURL berhasil di salin."

    "content": "Tokyo.\nJapan's parliament elected Shigeru Ishiba as the new prime minister on Tuesday, tasked with addressing public outrage over his governing party's corruption scandals ahead of a parliamentary election later this month, while trying to boost the economy and tackle security challenges from China and North Korea.\nIshiba replaces Fumio Kishida, who stepped down earlier Tuesday to pave the way for a fresh leader after Kishida's government was dogged by scandals.\nIshiba entered the Prime Minister's Office and formed his Cabinet, which includes several security and defense experts, as he has called for a stronger regional military alliance and a more equal Japan-US security partnership.\nIshiba said he plans to call a parliamentary election for Oct. 27 so his new administration can have “the people's judgment” as soon as possible.\nAdvertisement\nIshiba appointed to his Cabinet two former defense ministers with whom he has worked closely -- Takeshi Iwaya as foreign minister and Gen Nakatani as defense chief -- underscoring his emphasis on defense and security policies.\nOnly two of the 19 ministers are women: actor-turned-lawmaker Junko Mihara as children’s policy minister and Toshiko Abe as education minister. The government is under pressure to increase the number of women in public office. Women now account for only 10 percent of the lower house, placing Japan near the bottom of global gender-equality rankings.\nIshiba appointed several ministers who voted for him in the party leadership poll and retained Kishida's top confidante, Yoshimasa Hayashi, as chief Cabinet secretary. He also appointed Katsunobu Kato as finance minister. Hayashi also previously served as defense minister.\nThe majority of his Cabinet members, including Ishiba, are unaffiliated with factions led and controlled by party heavyweights, and none are from former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s powerful group linked to damaging scandals.\nIshiba’s lack of a stable power base could also mean his government will be fragile and “could quickly collapse” even though Ishiba hopes to build party unity as it prepares for the upcoming election, the liberal-leaning Asahi newspaper said.\nThe move is also seen as revenge by Ishiba, who was largely pushed to the side during most of Abe’s reign.\nIshiba announced his party’s leaders Monday ahead of naming his Cabinet. Former Environment Minister Shinjiro Koizumi, who came in third in the party leadership race, will head the party’s election task force.\n“I will squarely face the people, discuss policies sincerely to gain their understanding. My government won’t walk away from challenges and get things done,” Ishiba said before the parliamentary vote.\nOpposition leaders criticized Ishiba for announcing such a plan before even becoming leader and allowing only several days for his policies to be examined and discussed in parliament before the national election. The parliament Tuesday adopted a plan to have sessions until Oct. 9, when Ishiba is expected to dissolve the lower house ahead of the Oct. 27 vote.\nOpposition protests delayed the start of the parliamentary vote by about half an hour, signaling a rocky beginning for Ishiba.\nKishida had announced in August he would resign at the end of his three-year term to pave the way for a fresh leader ahead of the next national election, as corruption scandals dogged his party and government.\nEarlier Tuesday, Kishida and his ministers stepped down at a Cabinet meeting. Kishida left his office after a brief send-off ceremony in which he was presented a bouquet of red roses and applauded by his staff and former Cabinet members.\n“As we face a critical moment in and outside the country, I earnestly hope key policies that will pioneer Japan's future will be powerfully pursued by the new Cabinet,” Kishida said in a statement.\nIshiba has proposed an Asian version of the NATO military alliance and more discussion among regional partners about the use of the US nuclear deterrence. He also suggested a more equal Japan-US security alliance, including joint management of US bases in Japan and having Japanese Self Defense Force bases in the United States.\nIshiba outlined his views in an article to the Hudson Institute last week.\nIshiba proposes to combine existing security and diplomatic groupings, such as the Quad and other bilateral and multilateral frameworks involving the United States, Australia, New Zealand, South Korea and the Philippines.\nHe noted that an Asian version of NATO could also consider sharing control of US nuclear weapons in the region as a deterrence against growing threats from China, North Korea, and Russia.\nHe pledged to continue Kishida’s economic policy aimed at pulling Japan out of deflation and achieving real salary increases while tackling challenges such as Japan’s declining birthrate and population and resilience to natural disasters.\nThe LDP has had a nearly unbroken tenure governing Japan since World War II. The party members may have seen Ishiba’s more centrist views as crucial in pushing back challenges by the liberal-leaning opposition and winning voter support as the party reels from corruption scandals that drove down Kishida’s popularity.\nIshiba, first elected to parliament in 1986, has served as defense minister, agriculture minister and in other key Cabinet posts, and was LDP secretary-general under Abe.\nTags:\n#International\nKeywords:\nShigeru Ishiba\nLiberal Democratic Party (LDP)\nJapanese Prime Minister\nAsian Version of NATO\nJapanese Self-Defense Forces\nSHARE\nURL berhasil di salin."

    "date": "2024-09-30 13:43:00",
    "content": "Indonesian shrimp farmer Yulius Cahyonugroho operated more than two dozen ponds only a few years ago, employing seven people and making more than enough to support his family.\nSince then, the 39-year-old says the prices he gets from purchasers have fallen by half and he's had to scale back to four workers and about one-third of the ponds, some months not even breaking even. His wife has had to take a job at a watermelon farm to help support their two children.\n“It is more stable than the shrimp farms,” said the farmer from Indonesia’s Central Java province.\nAs big Western supermarkets make windfall profits, their aggressive pursuit of ever-lower wholesale prices is causing misery for people at the bottom end of the supply chain -- people like Cahyonugroho who produce and process the seafood, according to an investigation by an alliance of NGOs focused on three of the world's largest producers of shrimp provided to The Associated Press ahead of its publication on Monday.\nAdvertisement\nThe analysis of the industry in Vietnam, Indonesia and India, which provide about half the shrimp in the world's top four markets, found a 20-60 percent drop in earnings from pre-pandemic levels as producers struggle to meet pricing demands by cutting labor costs.\nIn many places this has meant unpaid and underpaid work through longer hours, wage insecurity as rates fluctuate, and many workers not even making low minimum wages. The report also found hazardous working conditions, particularly in India and parts of Indonesia, and even child labor in some places in India.\n“The supermarket procurement practices changed, and the working conditions were affected -- directly and rapidly,” said Katrin Nakamura of Sustainability Incubator, who wrote the regional report and whose Hawaii-based nonprofit led the research on the industry in Vietnam. “Those two things go together because they're tied together through the pricing.”\nTubagus Haeru Rahayu, the director general of aquaculture for Indonesia’s Maritime Affairs and Fisheries Ministry, said he was surprised by the report’s findings and had already reached out to people in the industry to investigate the price pressures.\n“If there is pressure like that, there will definitely be a reaction -- not only in Indonesia but in Vietnam and India too,\" he said in an interview at his Jakarta office.\nA worker sorts shrimps at a farm in Kebumen, Central Java, Indonesia, Tuesday, Sept. 24, 2024. (AP Photo/Dita Alangkara)\nIndian and Vietnamese officials refused to comment.\nSupermarkets linked to facilities where exploited labor was reported by workers include Target, Walmart and Costco in the United States, Britain's Sainsbury's and Tesco, and Aldi and Co-op in Europe.\nSwitzerland's Co-op said it had a “zero tolerance” policy for violations of labor law, and that its producers “receive fair and market-driven prices.”\nGermany’s Aldi did not specifically address the issue of pricing, but said it uses independent certification schemes to ensure responsibly sourcing for farmed shrimp products, and would continue to monitor the allegations.\n“We are committed to fulfilling our responsibility to respect human rights,” Aldi said.\nSainsbury's referred to a comment from the British Retail Consortium industry group, which said its members were committed to sourcing products at a \"fair, sustainable price” and that the welfare of people and communities in supply chains is fundamental to their purchasing practices.\nNone of the other retailers named in the report responded to multiple requests for comment on the report, titled “Human Rights for Dinner.”\nIn Vietnam, researchers found that workers who peel, gut and devein shrimp typically work six or seven days a week, often in rooms kept extremely cold to keep the product fresh.\nSome 80 percent of those involved in processing the shrimp are women who rise at 4 a.m. and return home at 6 p.m., with the exception of pregnant women and new mothers who can stop one hour earlier.\n“The work day for peelers consists of standing in a refrigerated and disinfected room and working extremely rapidly with a knife while taking care not to make a mistake,” researchers said.\nWages are generally not disclosed ahead of time and are based upon production. Sometimes workers make minimum wage, but frequently they do not.\nFarm worker Dias Yudho Prihantoro sits on his bed inside the hut where he and his brother stay during their work shifts at a shrimp farm in Kebumen, Central Java, Indonesia, Tuesday, Sept. 24, 2024. (AP Photo/Dita Alangkara)\nThe Vietnam Association of Seafood Exporters and Producers issued a statement calling the allegations in the report “unfounded, misleading and detrimental to the reputation of Vietnam’s shrimp exports.”\nIt cited government labor policies in a four-page statement but did not specifically address the findings, and did not respond to queries.\nAfter food supply chain disruptions during the COVID-19 pandemic, the US Federal Trade Commission reported earlier this year that some grocers have used the situation \"as an opportunity to further raise prices to increase their profits, which remain elevated today.”\nThe demands for lower wholesale shrimp prices -- combined with rising production costs and an oversupply -- means farmers often must sell their products under cost just to keep operations going, the Sustainability Incubator analysis found.\nCahyonugroho said he's stuck selling his shrimp at the price offered by middlemen who then sell it to factories for processing. He can't scrape together the startup costs needed to sell directly to factories or markets to earn more.\n“The opportunity is there,” he said, “but you need a lot of capital if you want to jump into something like that.”\nThe middlemen who buy the shrimp obfuscate the true sources of shrimp that appear in Western supermarkets, so many retailers may not be following ethical commitments they've made about procuring shrimp.\nOnly about 2,000 of the 2 million shrimp farms in the major producing countries of India, Indonesia, Vietnam, Ecuador, Thailand and Bangladesh are certified by either the Aquaculture Stewardship Council or the Best Aquaculture Practices ecolabel.\n\"With the yield from most certified shrimp farms being very small, it is mathematically impossible for certified farms to produce enough shrimp per month to supply all of the supermarkets that boast commitments to purchasing certified shrimp,” the report said.\nIdeally, supermarkets should pay higher wholesale prices and ensure that the extra money makes it all the way down the supply chain, Nakamura said.\nUS policymakers could use antitrust and other laws already in place to establish oversight to ensure fair pricing from Western retailers, rather than adding punishing tariffs on suppliers for labor violations, she said.\nAwareness about the trends hurting suppliers is growing.\nIn July, the European Union adopted a new directive requiring companies to “identify and address adverse human rights and environmental impacts of their actions inside and outside Europe.”\nBritain's Groceries Code Adjudicator office published a “deep dive” into views of suppliers about the conduct of supermarkets, saying they had chosen to conduct “warfare” with suppliers.\nHigher wholesale prices don't have to mean higher prices for consumers, Sustainability Incubator said.\n“Prices to farmers would be at least 200 percent higher than today if the shrimp sold in Global North supermarkets was made at minimum wage rates and in compliance with applicable domestic laws for labor, workplace health, and safety,” the report said. “This would not necessarily mean higher consumer prices, because supermarkets are already profiting at existing consumer prices.”\nResearchers from the Corporate Accountability Lab found that Indian shrimp industry workers face “dangerous and abusive conditions” and that highly-salinated water from newly-dug hatcheries and ponds, tainted with chemicals and toxic algae, are contaminating surrounding water and soil.\nUnpaid labor prevails, including salaries below minimum wage, unpaid overtime, wage deductions for costs of work and “significant” debt bondage, the report found.\nChild labor was also identified, with girls aged 14 and 15 being recruited for peeling work.\nIn Indonesia, three non-profit research organizations found that shrimp workers' wages have declined since the pandemic and now average $160 per month, below Indonesia's minimum wage in most of the biggest shrimp-producing provinces. Shrimp peelers were found to be routinely required to work at least 12 hours per day to meet minimum targets.\nA worker throws a net as he harvests shrimps at a farm in Kebumen, Central Java, Indonesia, Tuesday, Sept. 24, 2024. (AP Photo/Dita Alangkara)\nStill, given widespread poverty most workers said they're happy to have their jobs, said lead researcher Kharisma Nugroho of the Migunani Research Institute.\n“It’s exploitation of the vulnerability of the workers, because they have a lack of options,” he said.\n“They’re paid the minimum wages but they have to work 150 percent of the normal,” he told the AP. “Can they live? Yes. Can they move? Yes. Do they make a complaint? No. They’re still there.”\nThe regional report compiled more than 500 interviews conducted in-person with workers in their native languages, in India, Indonesia and Vietnam, supplemented with secondary data and interviews from Thailand, Bangladesh and Ecuador.\nAfter the Indonesia country report was issued recently, government officials asked to meet with the authors, and Nugroho said they showed a “genuine willingness to improve the situation.”\nVietnamese officials have also engaged with Sustainability Incubator to talk about the findings.\nGovernment and industry intervention has already helped in Thailand, which has been criticized after the AP exposed serious labor abuses in the shrimp industry in the past. That, however, has led to higher prices for Thai shrimp, leading some buyers to shift sourcing to India and Ecuador.\nEcuador has an industrial approach to shrimp farming -- unlike the smaller, often family-run operations in Southeast Asia -- and is now the world's largest exporter of shrimp. It has the lowest prices, followed by India; China, which wasn't included in the report; then Vietnam and Indonesia.\nBut with the demand for lower wholesale prices, while Ecuador’s exports rose 12 percent in volume in 2023, they fell 5 percent in value. India’s exports rose 1 percent but dropped nearly 11 percent in value.\nMeantime, with their relatively higher prices, Vietnam's exports were down 25 percent in 2023 in volume Indonesia's dropped 9.5 percent.\n“Labor exploitation in shrimp aquaculture industries is not company, sector, or country-specific,” the report concluded. “Instead, it is the result of a hidden business model that exploits people for profit.”\nTags:\n#Industry\n#Human Rights\nKeywords:\nShrimp Industry\nShrimp Farm\nLabor rights\nWalmart\nCostco\nTarget\nSHARE\nURL berhasil di salin."

    "content": "Washington/Jakarta.&nbsp;&nbsp;\nThe Federal Reserve is set to reduce its benchmark interest rate for the first time in over four years, with a decision expected Wednesday. Concurrently, Bank Indonesia forecasts three rate cuts by the Fed in 2024.\nThis comes as inflation has been largely contained, potentially lowering borrowing costs for consumers and businesses just weeks before the presidential election.\nUncertainty surrounds the size of the cut. Some economists and Wall Street traders predict a half-point reduction, while many analysts expect a more standard quarter-point cut. The move is seen as part of the Fed's effort to support a weakening job market while maintaining its inflation target.\nInflation has dropped from a high of 9.1 percent in June 2022 to 2.5 percent last month, just above the Fed’s 2 percent target. With inflation easing, the Fed is focusing on stabilizing the labor market and achieving a “soft landing,” aiming to curb inflation without triggering a recession.\nAdvertisement\nBank Indonesia Cuts Benchmark Interest Rate by 25 Basis Points to 6 Pct\nThis rate cut is expected to be the first of several, with additional reductions likely through 2025. These cuts are anticipated to lower borrowing costs for mortgages, auto loans, and credit cards, while encouraging business investment and stock market growth.\nThe job market, however, is showing signs of stress, with unemployment rising from its 2023 low of 3.4 percent to 4.2 percent. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has stressed that any further weakening in the labor market would be “unwelcome,” signaling that job growth remains a priority.\nMeanwhile, Bank Indonesia (BI) predicts the Fed will lower its benchmark rate three times in 2024 as inflation nears the Fed’s medium-term target of 2 percent, amid slowing economic growth and rising unemployment.\nBI Governor Perry Warjiyo indicated that these conditions have increased the likelihood of faster and larger cuts than originally anticipated. BI’s analysis projects three rate cuts in 2024, followed by four more in 2025.\n“Our data suggest that the FFR may drop by 25 basis points in September, November, and December 2024. Four more reductions are likely next year,” Perry said on Wednesday.\nThe uncertainty surrounding monetary policy in advanced economies is fading as global inflation pressures ease. In line with US&nbsp;economic trends, the yield on 2-year US&nbsp;Treasuries has fallen below the 10-year yield, and the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) has weakened. Similarly, the European Central Bank (ECB) has lowered its policy rate as inflation moves closer to its target.\n“In Asia, the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) has also cut interest rates in response to low inflation and weak domestic demand,” Perry added.\nHe noted that these trends are reducing global financial market uncertainty and attracting increased foreign capital flows to emerging markets, including Indonesia. With clearer signals of rate cuts from major economies, particularly the US, further capital inflows are expected, boosting external stability for developing countries.\n“These developments will support emerging markets in maintaining stability and promoting economic growth,” Perry concluded.\nTags:\n#Economy\nKeywords:\nThe Federal Reserve\nFFR\ninterest rate\nBank Indonesia\nSHARE\nURL berhasil di salin."

It is typical trade protectionism,” it added.\nAdvertisement\nThe ministry urged Canada to “immediately correct its wrong practices” and said that Beijing would take any necessary measures to defend the rights and interests of Chinese companies.\nCanada’s announcement came after encouragement by US national security adviser Jake Sullivan during a meeting with Trudeau and Cabinet ministers on Sunday. Sullivan began his first visit to Beijing on Tuesday.\nChinese officials are likely to raise concerns about the American tariffs with Sullivan as Beijing continues to repair its economy, which was hit by the COVID-19 pandemic. In May, US President Joe Biden slapped major new tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, advanced batteries, solar cells, steel, aluminum and medical equipment.\nA Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson on Tuesday urged Canada to “not politicize economic and trade issues.”\n“China’s burgeoning electric vehicle industry is the result of continuous technological innovation, a well-established industrial and supply chain and full market competition,” spokesperson Lin Jian said.\nTrudeau said that Canada also would impose a 25 percent tariff on Chinese steel and aluminum.\n“Actors like China have chosen to give themselves an unfair advantage in the global marketplace,” he said.\nOne of the Chinese-made EVs imported into Canada is from Tesla, made at the company’s Shanghai factory, though the US company could avoid the tariff by switching to supplying Canada from factories in the US or Germany.\nChinese brands aren't yet a player in Canada. However, Chinese EV company BYD established a Canadian corporate entity last spring and has indicated that it intends to try and enter the Canadian market as early as next year.\nChinese firms can sell EVs for as little as $12,000. China’s solar cell plants and steel and aluminum mills have enough capacity to meet much of the world’s demand. Chinese officials argue their production keeps prices low and would aid a transition to a green economy.\nDeputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland said that Canada also will launch a 30-day consultation about possible tariffs on Chinese batteries, battery parts, semiconductors, critical minerals, metals and solar panels.\n“China has an intentional state-directed policy of overcapacity and oversupply designed to cripple our own industry,” Freeland said. “We simply will not allow that to happen to our EV sector, which has shown such promise.”\nTags:\n#Trade\nKeywords:\nChinese Electric Vehicles\nChina-Canada relations\nCanada EV Tariff\nWTO\nprotectionism\nglobal trade\nelectric vehicles\nEV Industry\nJustin Trudeau\nSHARE\nURL berhasil di salin."

The Indonesian government has extended safeguard tariffs on imports of textiles, carpets, and other fabric coverings for another three years in a bid to protect and enhance the competitiveness of the domestic textile industry.\nThe extension of these import duties is outlined in two new regulations: Finance Minister Regulation (PMK) No. 48/2024 for textiles and PMK No. 49/2024 for carpets and other fabric coverings. The decision aims to counteract challenges faced by the textile and textile product (TPT) sector, which has struggled to return to pre-pandemic levels due to declining domestic and export demand and increasing competition.\nThe TPT sector has seen a decline in employment, with the workforce dropping from 3.98 million in 2023 to 3.87 million in 2024.

    "content": "On August 8, 2024, the people of Southeast Asia will commemorate the 57th anniversary of ASEAN, founded in 1967 in Bangkok by five founding countries—Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, and Singapore. ASEAN was established during the Cold War to create stability and promote cooperation in a region often beset by political turbulence. Over time, ASEAN has placed greater emphasis on promoting economic development and cultural exchange among its members, maintaining regional peace and stability, and building closer relations with like-minded foreign powers.\nThe strategic significance of Southeast Asia cannot be underestimated. This region is the most accessible tropical expanse in the world, situated at the crossroads of maritime routes between East Asia and the Middle East, and the Mediterranean. It is no wonder that Southeast Asia has historically attracted the interest of global powers seeking to establish a foothold here. Nevertheless, ASEAN has so far managed to maintain the region’s relative stability and peace, enabling its 10 member countries to focus on their economic development while coordinating policies at the regional level through various work programs under the economic pillar of the ASEAN Community.\nSupporters and critics alike generally agree that ASEAN has played an increasingly significant role in the global supply chain in the last three decades. However, the strategic environment in which ASEAN operates has changed dramatically compared to ten or fifteen years ago. Trade wars between major countries, the spread of COVID-19, wars and security issues in critical parts of the world economy, and how countries respond to an increasingly fragmented global economy have all led to continuous disruptions in the global supply chain. In this context, two general questions are intriguing to explore as ASEAN enters its 57th year: how deeply has ASEAN integrated its ten member economies, and how should ASEAN respond to the changing global economic environment now and in the future?\nASEAN’s Progress\nThanks to the tireless efforts of ASEAN Economic Ministers, senior officials, and their subordinates, ASEAN economic integration has been accelerated through numerous initiatives and frameworks designed to strengthen economic connectivity, trade, and investment among member countries. The ASEAN Economic Community Blueprint 2025, a continuation and deepening of the previous blueprint, contains a comprehensive plan to enhance ASEAN economic integration, with a particular emphasis on creating an integrated and cohesive economic region, boosting competitiveness and productivity, promoting innovation, and developing a resilient, inclusive, and people-oriented ASEAN.\nAdvertisement\nIn brief, ASEAN's economic integration agenda rests on three fundamental agreements that have been refined and improved over time: the ASEAN Trade in Goods Agreement, the ASEAN Trade in Services Agreement, and the ASEAN Comprehensive Investment Agreement. These agreements are supplemented with various understandings, protocols, directives, implementing agreements, and procedures to facilitate the implementation of all ASEAN economic agreements.\nASEAN also recognizes the importance of digital transformation to drive economic growth and integration. To this end, a series of work programs are being implemented to leverage technological advancements within the ASEAN Digital Integration Framework to develop digital trade, cross-border e-commerce, and innovation to support the digital economy. Concurrently, ASEAN is developing the Smart Cities Network Initiatives to promote sustainable urban development and improve quality of life through technology and innovation.\nTo further facilitate regional economic development, ASEAN is currently finalizing work programs under the Master Plan on ASEAN Connectivity 2025, focused on improving physical, institutional, and people-to-people connectivity through infrastructure projects, policy harmonization, and human resource development. Two of the projects related to connectivity development are the ASEAN Highway Network (AHN) and the ASEAN Power Grid (APG).\nASEAN operates in a global context and therefore also focuses on fostering economic cooperation with neighboring countries. In this regard, ASEAN has and is implementing free trade agreements with its partners, namely China, Japan, South Korea, India, Australia, and New Zealand. Several of these agreements are undergoing reviews to improve market access, facilitation, or cooperation to ensure fair benefits for member countries. Most recently, in November 2020, ASEAN signed the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) with key partners—China, Japan, South Korea, as well as Australia and New Zealand. RCEP is the world's largest trade agreement by market size (population) and aims to strengthen market access and economic cooperation among its members. RCEP can be seen as a means to realize the aspiration of making this region a new center of global economic growth.\nMoving Forward\nWhile the prospects are promising, ASEAN faces at least five major challenges that require special attention. The first is the economic disparity among its member countries, which can hinder integration efforts. This challenge can be effectively addressed only if ASEAN—both individually and collectively—succeeds in promoting quality growth where no member country or segment of society is left behind.\nThe second challenge is policy coordination and harmonization. The recent global trend toward implementing national economic resilience policies could incentivize ASEAN countries to introduce new regulations that may not align with regional commitments under ASEAN. Historically, there has been a tendency within ASEAN to introduce national variations of regional agreements. Differences in regulatory standards and business practices have proven to be challenges for promoting economic integration. This may explain why intra-ASEAN trade has consistently accounted for only around 25% of ASEAN’s total trade with the world.\nNavigating the process of economic integration amidst current geopolitical and geo-economic tensions requires ASEAN to adopt a multi-faceted strategy emphasizing resilience, diversification, cooperation, and strategic adjustments. Several key approaches must be pursued to ensure that ASEAN remains united, relevant, and resilient amidst various contemporary and future challenges. To this end, ASEAN needs to strengthen intra-ASEAN trade and investment by continuously improving the existing supply chains in ASEAN and promoting industrial complementarity among member countries to reduce dependence on non-ASEAN markets. Efforts in this direction should be supported by further simplifying customs procedures and reducing non-tariff barriers to boost intra-ASEAN trade. Effective implementation of the ASEAN Single Window and harmonization of standards could be crucial steps in this direction.\nImplementing the RCEP Agreement can encourage ASEAN to strengthen policy coordination and harmonization if ASEAN wants to derive proportional benefits from RCEP, and not just for its non-ASEAN partners. Efforts in this direction might include aligning investment policies, labor standards, and environmental standards at the ASEAN level. Additionally, developing clear mechanisms for responding to economic and financial crises can help ASEAN respond effectively to future external shocks, such as by strengthening the ASEAN+3 Macroeconomic Research Office (AMRO) and the Chiang Mai Initiative Multilateralization (CMIM).\nThe third challenge, closely related to the above, is diversifying and maximizing economic partnerships based on clear strategies to achieve extensive supply chain resilience. This can be done by diversifying sources of critical inputs and enhancing local production capacities to mitigate the impact of global disruptions. Ensuring the effective implementation of the RCEP Agreement, including expanding its membership, is one approach. As the world's largest FTA, RCEP offers its 15 member countries an opportunity to form resilient regional supply chains with ASEAN as the “hub.” Instead of individually exploring the formation of resilient supply chains with other regions, ASEAN countries should play a leadership role in fully operationalizing RCEP with non-ASEAN partners in the agreement.\nSimultaneously, ASEAN should continue to explore and deepen trade development with other major economies, including the European Union, the United States, and other emerging markets. Diversifying trade partnerships can reduce ASEAN’s vulnerability to disruptions in any one of its major markets. Active participation in multilateral trade forums like the WTO can also help ASEAN contribute to strengthening the rules-based global trading system and mitigating the impact of protectionism.\nFourth, ASEAN needs to accelerate the implementation of the ASEAN Digital Integration Framework to promote digital trade, e-commerce, and innovation. This includes investing in digital infrastructure and promoting digital literacy among member countries. Additionally, initiatives like the ASEAN Smart Cities Network need to be expedited to create sustainable urban areas and promote technological innovation to position ASEAN as a hub of growth driven by technological advancements. Parallel to this, ASEAN should also focus on sustainable development and green growth, which can strengthen the region’s long-term resilience. ASEAN can leverage initiatives like the ASEAN Green Bond Standards to attract investment in sustainability projects.\nThe fifth and final challenge is maintaining a balanced approach in its relations with major powers such as China, the United States, and the European Union. Jointly prepared and executed diplomatic efforts to prevent ASEAN from being drawn into one geopolitical camp will help maintain ASEAN’s strategic relevance in the region and the world. This involves collective decision-making to advocate for common positions in international negotiations.\nASEAN’s ability to advance its economic integration agenda amid global tensions will largely depend on its capacity to strengthen intra-regional ties, diversify partnerships with other countries, implement digital transformation, build regional economic resilience, coordinate and harmonize policies both nationally and regionally, and conduct proactive diplomacy. All these require strong leadership within ASEAN, and as a critical mass in ASEAN, it is reasonable to hope that Indonesia will once again play its key role in leading ASEAN to the next level.\n---\nIman Pambagyo is a former director general of trade negotiations and an Indonesian ambassador in charge of the WTO.\nThe views expressed in this article are those of the author.\nTags:\n#International\nKeywords:\nAsean\nASEAN 57th Anniversary\nSHARE\nURL berhasil di salin."

He noted that the policy is still under thorough review to ensure it aligns with the needs of domestic industries and international trade norms.\n“We are not targeting any particular country, least of all China. All steps are taken based on our national interests,” Luhut said in an official statement in Jakarta on Friday.\nLuhut explained that in a meeting led by President Joko \"Jokowi\" Widodo on June 25, it was decided to protect domestic industries in accordance with prevailing regulations and international trade norms.\nOne measure taken is the implementation of a safeguard tariff or import duty safeguard (BMTP) for certain textile products, which has already been enforced.

    "content": "Jakarta.\nIndonesia is blessed with abundant critical minerals, but the nickel-rich country needs to look beyond this natural wealth when trying to enter the global supply chain as countries become increasingly aware of sustainability standards, according to a think-tank.\nThe 2024 US Geological Survey report shows that Indonesia ranks first globally when it comes to nickel reserves -- a mainstay in electric vehicles (EV) batteries. Indonesian nickel reserves stand at 55 million metric tons, seconded by that of Australia (24 million metric tons). Indonesia is on the lead for nickel production as its mines produced an estimated 1.8 million metric tons of the silvery-white metal in 2023.&nbsp;\nThe country is among the world’s top producers of tin which is vital to smartphone manufacturing. Indonesian tin mines produced approximately 52,000 metric tons throughout last year -- third only to China (68,000 metric tons) and Myanmar (54,000 metric tons). The archipelagic Indonesia also produces cobalt, bauxite, and copper.&nbsp;\nThese statistics often appear in the government’s pitches when trying to get foreign investors into the country. Government officials repeatedly said that the abundance of critical minerals could help Indonesia penetrate the global supply chain of green goods. But think-tank CSIS Indonesia said that the country needed to do just more than flaunting its ample mineral reserves.\nAdvertisement\n“We can no longer treat our critical mineral abundance as a selling point. Because other countries also have critical minerals, but they implement higher environmental standards and practices,” M Habib Abiyan Dzakwan, a researcher at CSIS Indonesia, said at the think-tank’s sustainable investment report launch on Monday.\n“[Having high sustainability standards] makes a better selling point.\"\nAccording to the freshly launched report, other critical mineral owners have been trying to secure their spot in the global supply chain. Countries such as Canada and Australia have been implementing sustainability standards to give them a better competitive edge.&nbsp;\nThe US Geological Survey data indicates that Australia and Canada produce similar critical minerals to Indonesia.&nbsp; Australia not only boasts huge reserves of lithium which Indonesia lacks, but it is also producing nickel, tin, among others. Canada is also a nickel producer, although its production in 2023 was only a tenth of what Indonesia recorded that year.\n“These countries are implementing relatively high environmental standards. … Canada seeks to be a superpower in sustainable industry practices. So Canada pays attention to the logistics [of the industry] and the need to use renewable power plants. Australia also wishes [to use its critical minerals] to become a renewable energy superpower,” Habib said.\nDomestic processing is the cornerstone of Indonesia’s critical mineral policies. President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo wants Indonesia to process its minerals at home to produce greater value-added goods. This strategy sees Indonesia banning exports of unprocessed minerals -- starting with nickel. Jokowi’s successor Prabowo Subianto is planning to implement the same strategy to grow the Indonesian economy.&nbsp;&nbsp;\nHowever, CSIS argued that the government had been focusing more on the end goal of producing green tech goods. For instance, Indonesia has been concentrating more on encouraging battery-based EV production and its adoption. However, the government is not giving as much attention to making sure that the domestic nickel supply chain is environmentally friendly.&nbsp;\n“Ideally, this domestic processing policy does not only focus on the end goal, but we have to make sure that the means or the production is sustainable. This includes keeping a watchful eye on how much greenhouse gas emission is being emitted in the process,” Habib said.\nHe added: “There is nothing wrong with managing the critical minerals we have, but the process should pay attention to the international standards and the environment.”\nTags:\n#Energy &amp; Minerals\nKeywords:\nIndonesian Nickel\nIndonesian Nickel Reserves\nCritical Minerals\nCritical Minerals in Indonesia\nDomestic Processing\nCSIS Indonesia\nsustainability\nSustainability Standards\nM Habib Abiyan Dzakwan\nSHARE\nURL berhasil di salin."

    "date": "2024-06-19 07:10:00",
    "content": "Palm oil has long been a key trade priority for Indonesia. However, as the fourth most populous country in the world, Indonesia is increasingly concerned about the intensifying negative campaigns against palm oil. These campaigns are driven by NGOs, competing vegetable oil industries, and governments at both central and regional levels in various countries. For instance, the European Union (EU) adopted the Renewable Energy Directive II (RED II), which arbitrarily categorizes palm oil as a high \"Indirect Land Use Change\" (ILUC) risk commodity. This directive mandates a reduction in palm oil consumption in the EU starting in 2021, aiming for its eventual elimination by December 31, 2030.\nMore recently, the EU introduced the EU Deforestation Regulation (EUDR), a policy framework aimed at reducing the environmental impact of deforestation. The EUDR requires operators and traders who place seven commodities (palm oil, coffee, cocoa, rubber, wood, soy, and cattle) on the EU market or export them from the EU to prove that these products are legal and do not come from land deforested or degraded after December 31, 2020.\nElsewhere, Norway has excluded palm oil biofuel from government procurement processes, a regional state in Pakistan proposed a tariff increase on palm oil for health-related reasons, and India has repeatedly raised its import tariffs on palm oil due to domestic political considerations. This situation evokes the beggar-thy-neighbor policy, where one country addresses its economic issues through measures that often exacerbate the economic difficulties of other nations.\nFor producing countries, palm oil represents more than just a commodity. The palm oil sector provides livelihoods for 16 million Indonesians through direct and indirect employment. Small farmers in rural and remote areas are heavily involved in palm plantations, comprising 42 percent&nbsp;in Indonesia, 40 percent&nbsp;in Malaysia, and 80 percent in Nigeria. In Indonesia alone, about 61 cities and small towns rely on this sector for their development and sustenance. Additionally, palm oil is a crucial source of export revenue for Indonesia, generating around $ 22.67 billion in 2023, with the EU, China, and India being the primary export destinations.\nAdvertisement\nGiven these stakes, it is unsurprising that Indonesia voices significant concerns over increased efforts to wage a trade war against palm oil. From Indonesia's perspective, if the issue is environmental impact, then all vegetable oils should be treated equally. Targeting palm oil without applying the same standards to other vegetable oils appears discriminatory and biased. Indonesia believes that environmental issues should be addressed holistically, without singling out specific products or sectors.\nA report issued by the European Commission's Directorate-General for Environment (DG Envi) in 2013, titled \"The Impact of EU Consumption on Deforestation,\" suggests that globally, the main crops contributing directly or indirectly to deforestation include soybeans (19 percent), maize (11 percent), oil palm (8 percent), rice (6 percent), and sugar cane (5 percent). Another report highlights that livestock is a primary non-vegetable oil contributor to deforestation, responsible for 18% of greenhouse gas emissions, 55% of water consumption, and 45% of land use.\nRegarding health concerns, existing studies suggest that consuming saturated fatty acids from palm oil does not inherently increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases. Even if saturated fats need to be regulated, measures should be non-discriminatory, targeting all food products containing saturated fats, regardless of their origin.\nOther vegetable oils also pose health risks. For example, canola oil is associated with kidney and liver problems, heart conditions, hypertension, strokes, and growth retardation in infants due to its erucic acid content and higher trans fat levels. Over 90 percent&nbsp;of canola oil is genetically modified, raising concerns about toxicity, allergic reactions, immune suppression, cancer, and nutritional loss. Similarly, soybean oil is linked to obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and inflammation due to excessive Omega-6 fatty acids. It is also manufactured using harsh chemical solvents, which can cause serious health issues.\nThe question remains: why is palm oil continually blamed as the main source of environmental and health problems? Palm oil is the most efficient oil crop, producing the highest tonnage per hectare. When sustainably produced and properly processed, palm oil is not a threat to nature or human health but rather a gift from nature. Campaigning against palm oil in favor of other vegetable oils will be perceived as punitive by Indonesian farmers. This approach neither addresses the issues effectively nor promotes free and fair trade.\nAs global value chains face disruptions and more countries adopt reciprocal trade measures, Indonesia might consider following suit if it feels unfairly treated. However, Indonesia remains hopeful that fair trade is possible, which is why it brought the palm oil issue to the WTO against the EU. It is a matter of principle, and the government should not trade off its offensive stand on palm oil for its defensive interest in nickel, for example. Indonesia should hold its ground, as the livelihoods of millions are at stake.\n---\nIman Pambagyo is a former Director General for Trade Negotiations and an Indonesian Ambassador in charge of the WTO.\nThe views expressed in this article are those of the author.\nTags:\n#Commodity\nKeywords:\npalm oil\nCPO\nEUDR\nPalm Oil Export\nSHARE\nURL berhasil di salin."

    "content": "Brussels.\nVoters in the European Union are set to elect lawmakers starting Thursday for the bloc's parliament, in a major democratic exercise that's also likely to be overshadowed by online disinformation.\nExperts have warned that artificial intelligence could supercharge the spread of fake news that could disrupt the election in the EU and many other countries this year. But the stakes are especially high in Europe, which has been confronting Russian propaganda efforts as Moscow's war with Ukraine drags on.\nHere's a closer look:\nWhat's Happening?\nSome 360 million people in 27 nations -- from Portugal to Finland, Ireland to Cyprus -- will choose 720 European Parliament lawmakers in an election that runs from Thursday to Sunday. In the months leading up to the vote, experts have observed a surge in the quantity and quality of fake news and anti-EU disinformation being peddled in member countries.\nAdvertisement\nA big fear is that deceiving voters will be easier than ever, enabled by new AI tools that make it easy to create misleading or false content. Some of the malicious activity is domestic, some international. Russia is most widely blamed, and sometimes China, even though hard evidence directly attributing such attacks is difficult to pin down.\n“Russian state-sponsored campaigns to flood the EU information space with deceptive content is a threat to the way we have been used to conducting our democratic debates, especially in election times,” Josep Borrell, the EU's foreign policy chief, warned on Monday.\nHe said Russia's \"information manipulation\" efforts are taking advantage of increasing use of social media penetration “and cheap AI-assisted operations.\" Bots are being used to push smear campaigns against European political leaders who are critical of Russian President Vladimir Putin, he said.\nHas Any Disinfo Happened Yet?\nThere have been plenty of examples of election-related disinformation.\nTwo days before national elections in Spain last July, a fake website was registered that mirrored one run by authorities in the capital Madrid. It posted an article falsely warning of a possible attack on polling stations by the disbanded Basque militant separatist group ETA.\nIn Poland, two days before the October parliamentary election, police descended on a polling station in response to a bogus bomb threat. Social media accounts linked to what authorities call the Russian interference “infosphere” claimed a device had exploded.\nJust days before Slovakia’s parliamentary election in November, AI-generated audio recordings impersonated a candidate discussing plans to rig the election, leaving fact-checkers scrambling to debunk them as false as they spread across social media.\nJust last week, Poland’s national news agency carried a fake report saying that Prime Minister Donald Tusk was mobilizing 200,000 men starting on July 1, in an apparent hack that authorities blamed on Russia. The Polish News Agency “killed,” or removed, the report minutes later and issued a statement saying that it wasn’t the source.\nIt's “really worrying, and a bit different than other efforts to create disinformation from alternative sources,\" said Alexandre Alaphilippe, executive director of EU DisinfoLab, a nonprofit group that researches disinformation. “It raises notably the question of cybersecurity of the news production, which should be considered as critical infrastructure.”\nWhat's The Goal of Disinformation?\nExperts and authorities said Russian disinformation is aimed at disrupting democracy, by deterring voters across the EU from heading to the ballot boxes.\n“Our democracy cannot be taken for granted, and the Kremlin will continue using disinformation, malign interference, corruption and any other dirty tricks from the authoritarian playbook to divide Europe,” European Commission Vice-President Vera Jourova warned the parliament in April.\nTusk, meanwhile, called out Russia's “destabilization strategy on the eve of the European elections.”\nOn a broader level, the goal of “disinformation campaigns is often not to disrupt elections,\" said Sophie Murphy Byrne, senior government affairs manager at Logically, an AI intelligence company. “It tends to be ongoing activity designed to appeal to conspiracy mindsets and erode societal trust,\" she told an online briefing last week.\nNarratives are also fabricated to fuel public discontent with Europe’s political elites, attempt to divide communities over issues like family values, gender or sexuality, sow doubts about climate change and chip away at Western support for Ukraine, EU experts and analysts say.\nWhat Has Changed?\nFive years ago, when the last European Union election was held, most online disinformation was laboriously churned out by “troll farms” employing people working in shifts writing manipulative posts in sometimes clumsy English or repurposing old video footage. Fakes were easier to spot.\nNow, experts have been sounding that alarm about the rise of generative AI that they say threatens to supercharge the spread of election disinformation worldwide. Malicious actors can use the same technology that underpins easy-to-use platforms, like OpenAI’s ChatGPT, to create authentic-looking deepfake images, videos and audio. Anyone with a smartphone and a devious mind can potentially create false, but convincing, content aimed at fooling voters.\n“What is changing now is the scale that you can achieve as a propaganda actor,” said Salvatore Romano, head of research at AI Forensics, a nonprofit research group. Generative AI systems can now be used to automatically pump out realistic images and videos and push them out to social media users, he said.\nAI Forensics recently uncovered a network of pro-Russian pages that it said took advantage of Meta’s failure to moderate political advertising in the European Union.\nFabricated content is now “indistinguishable” from the real thing, and takes disinformation watchers experts a lot longer to debunk, said Romano.\nWhat Are Authorities Doing About It?\nThe EU is using a new law, the Digital Services Act, to fight back. The sweeping law requires platforms to curb the risk of spreading disinformation and can be used to hold them accountable under the threat of hefty fines.\nThe bloc is using the law to demand information from Microsoft about risks posed by its Bing Copilot AI chatbot, including concerns about “automated manipulation of services that can mislead voters.”\nThe DSA has also been used to investigate Facebook and Instagram owner Meta Platforms for not doing enough to protect users from disinformation campaigns.\nThe EU has passed a wide-ranging artificial intelligence law, which includes a requirement for deepfakes to be labeled, but it won't arrive in time for the vote and will take effect over the next two years.\nHow Are Social Media Companies Responding?\nMost tech companies have touted the measures they're taking to protect the European Union's “election integrity.”\nMeta Platforms -- owner of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp -- has said it will set up an election operations center to identify potential online threats. It also has thousands of content reviewers working in the EU’s 24 official languages and is tightening up policies on AI-generated content, including labeling and “downranking” AI-generated content that violates its standards.\nNick Clegg, Meta's president of global affairs, has said there’s no sign that generative AI tools are being used on a systemic basis to disrupt elections.\nTikTok said it will set up fact-checking hubs in the video-sharing platform’s app. YouTube owner Google said it’s working with fact-checking groups and will use AI to “fight abuse at scale.”\nElon Musk went the opposite way with his social media platform X, previously known as Twitter. “Oh you mean the ‘Election Integrity’ Team that was undermining election integrity? Yeah, they’re gone,” he said in a post in September.\nTags:\n#International\nKeywords:\nEU Elections\neuropean union\nMisinformation\ndisinformation\nSHARE\nURL berhasil di salin."

    "content": "On May 22, 2024, John Chen, the Representative of the Taipei Economic and Trade Office in Indonesia, wrote an article titled “China’s Misinterpretation of United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758.”&nbsp;\nIn this article, Chen asserts that \"China repeatedly misinterprets the UN resolution and inappropriately associates it with the 'One China Principle.'” According to John Chen, China’s aim is not only to limit and exclude Taiwan from international organizations but also to use this resolution as a weapon to universalize the 'One China Policy' to force other countries to accept its political claims, undermine the international order, and establish a legal basis for a future military attack on Taiwan.\nChen's argument is built without reference to objective facts and official international resolutions. According to the United Nations' official website, Resolution 2758 is the only resolution passed at the 1971 UN General Assembly that states “Taiwan is a province of China.”&nbsp;\nOn October 25, 1971, the 26th UN General Assembly passed Resolution 2758 with a majority vote, deciding to restore all rights to the People's Republic of China in the United Nations and recognize the representatives of its government as the only legitimate representatives of China in the UN. This completely resolved the issue of Taiwan’s representation by China in the UN politically, legally, and procedurally.\nAdvertisement\nThe Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) of Taiwan, along with all political parties in Taiwan and the Taiwanese government, need to engage in constructive dialogue based on full trust in the central Chinese government to ensure a peaceful reunification process. Peace is the aspiration of all people on both sides of the Strait. Conversely, the continuous conflict will only benefit parties outside of China.&nbsp;\nThis article narrates how the issue of Taiwan's independence&nbsp;will economically benefit the United States. Without any external intervention, the reunification of China can proceed peacefully.\nThe Principle of 'One China Policy'\nLai Ching-te, from the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), elected as the 8th president of Taiwan in the 2024 election, poses a unique challenge to the process of China’s reunification. The DPP authorities in Taiwan have ignored the goodwill of the central Chinese government and have aggressively pursued political interests that only benefit the DPP.\nThis attitude was evident during the World Health Assembly (WHA), the international health body under the WHO (World Health Organization). On Monday, WHO member countries decided not to invite Taiwan to the organization's annual assembly in Geneva in May 2024. Before the WHA session, nearly 140 countries clearly supported China’s position, and almost 100 countries sent letters to the WHO Director-General or made public statements reaffirming the UN’s adherence to the 'One China Policy,' opposing Taiwan’s participation in the WHA, emphasizing that Taiwan lacks a political basis to participate in the WHA, and stating that issues related to Taiwan should not disrupt the meeting process.&nbsp;\nThese voices of justice reflect dissatisfaction and warnings against the DPP authorities in Taiwan and efforts to uphold and enforce international law and justice.\nThe WHA’s stance aligns with the political stance of most countries globally in supporting the 'One China Policy.' The UN, as the highest international body, respects the 'One China Policy' and firmly opposes any attempts to distort, nullify, or challenge the fundamental system of international law, the integrity of all countries' sovereignty and territorial integrity, compliance with UN resolutions and WHO rules, and the post-World War II international order.\nThere is only one China in the world, Taiwan is an inseparable part of China’s territory, and the Government of the People's Republic of China is the only legitimate government representing all of China. However, the DPP authorities in Taiwan and certain countries have proposed motions related to Taiwan in an attempt to create 'Two Chinas' or 'One China, One Taiwan' in the WHO and other UN bodies, seriously violating international law, betraying political commitments made to China by relevant countries, and violating basic norms governing international relations.\nThe return of Taiwan to China is a critical process of China’s reunification, not just an internal affair of the people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait but also a significant issue of international concern. The majority of countries globally and the UN, as the most important international organization, recognize the 'One China Policy,' demonstrating that most countries support China and firmly oppose any attempts to distort, nullify, and challenge the existing international system.\nA series of international legal documents, such as the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Proclamation, have clearly defined China’s sovereignty over Taiwan. UNGA Resolution 2758 and WHA Resolution 25.1 both affirm the 'One China Policy' principle. All peace-loving parties and those who uphold UN resolutions will not allow activities leading to Taiwan's independence&nbsp;as it seriously violates China’s territorial sovereignty and undermines and subverts international rules.\nUS&nbsp;Intervention In the Issue of Taiwan's Independence&nbsp;\nRegarding China’s reunification, we must fully understand that the process is not a smooth journey but a challenging one that requires effort and sacrifice.&nbsp;\nAll parties should face this wisely, based on objective and legitimate resolutions, so that the grand goal of building and reunifying China will not be affected by any interference, and the peaceful reunification of both sides of the strait will eventually be achieved.\nThe US political situation significantly determines their intervention in Taiwan. Due to intense competition between the two parties, 'anti-China' sentiment has become one of the most crucial political truths. Both the Republican and Democratic parties have the same political stance of 'anti-China' politics. No politician from either party takes the initiative to create a peaceful resolution for the Taiwan issue. In recent years, there have been many irrational and extreme politicians who care only about making noise without considering the consequences.\nIt is clear that the US has adopted many extreme actions in recent years, such as passing over ten Taiwan-related bills within a few days in 2023, which is entirely unreasonable. Although the government and military might consider more rational thinking, politicians in Congress do not.\nWho Benefits from Taiwan's Independence?\nThe US government is the most active in political efforts to promote the discourse of Taiwan's independence --&nbsp;from openly building and leading global public opinion to support Taiwan's independence and&nbsp;sending government officials for diplomatic visits to Taiwan, to more covert methods like infiltrating Taiwan’s government and decision-making bodies.\nThe DPP authorities believe they can relax by paying 'protection money' to the US, but they do not realize this is a path of 'self-destruction.' US arms sales to Taiwan will not guarantee Taiwan’s security but will create tension and antagonism between both sides of the Strait, hamper Taiwan’s development, and even push Taiwan into the difficulties of war, leading it into a dangerous conflict.\nChina's sanctions against foreign companies selling arms to Taiwan send a clear signal not only to the companies involved but also to the US government and Taiwan independence&nbsp;forces. Any steps to undermine the 'One China Policy' principle and obstruct China’s reunification will never succeed.\nThe future of Taiwan lies in the reunification of the country, and Taiwan's security depends on the joint efforts of people on both sides of the strait under the 'One China Policy' principle. The issue of Taiwan's security cannot be resolved through US arms sales to Taiwan, as this only poses a significant threat to Taiwan’s security.\nThe DPP authorities in Taiwan should stop provocative actions that escalate Taiwan-related issues. They should build a stance of not underestimating the Chinese people's determination and ability to fully achieve national reunification, release Taiwan’s dependency on US arms as soon as possible, recognize the '1992 Consensus,' and return to the correct path of political resolution of cross-strait issues. The tide of history rolls forward and is unstoppable.\n---\nVeronika Shinta Saraswati is the head of the International Relations Program at the Institute for China-Indonesia Partnership Studies.\nThe views expressed in this article are those of the author.\nTags:\n#International\nKeywords:\nTaiwan independence\nOne China policy\nTaiwan Strait\nChina and Taiwan\nSHARE\nURL berhasil di salin."

    "content": "Washington.\nWhether it's tapioca balls or computer chips, Taiwan is stretching toward the United States and away from China -- the world's No. 2 economy that threatens to take the democratically ruled island by force if necessary.\nThat has translated to the world’s biggest maker of computer chips -- which power everything from medical equipment to cellphones -- announcing bigger investments in the US last month after a boost from the Biden administration. Soon afterward, a Taiwanese semiconductor company said it was ending its two-decade-long run in mainland China amid a global race to gain the edge in the high-tech industry.\nThese changes at a time of an intensifying China-US rivalry reflect Taiwan’s efforts to reduce its reliance on Beijing and insulate itself from Chinese pressure while forging closer economic and trade ties with the United States, its strongest ally. The shift also is taking place as China’s economic growth has been weak and global businesses are looking to diversify following supply chain disruptions during the pandemic.\nIn a stark illustration of the shift, the US displaced mainland China as the top destination for Taiwan’s exports in the first quarter of the year for the first time since the start of 2016, when comparable data became available. The island exported $24.6 billion worth of goods to the US in the first three months, compared with $22.4 billion to mainland China, according to Taiwan’s official data.\nAdvertisement\nMeanwhile, the island’s investments in mainland China have fallen to the lowest level in more than 20 years, dropping nearly 40 percent to $3 billion last year from a year earlier, according to Taiwan’s Ministry of Economic Affairs. Yet, Taiwan’s investments in the US surged ninefold to $9.6 billion in 2023.\nWashington and Taipei signed a trade agreement last year, and they’re now negotiating the next phase. US lawmakers also have introduced a bill to end double taxes for Taiwanese businesses and workers in the US.\n“Everything is motivated by ... a desire to build Taiwan’s deterrent capability and their resilience, all in support of maintaining the status quo and deterring China from being tempted to take ... action against Taiwan,” Assistant Secretary of State Daniel Kritenbrink said.\nThe world’s biggest computer chip maker, TSMC, announced last month that it would expand its U.S. investments to $65 billion. That came after the Biden administration pledged up to $6.6 billion in incentives that would put the company's facilities in Arizona on track to produce about one-fifth of the world’s most advanced chips by 2030.\nApart from its U.S. investments, TSMC is putting money into Japan, a staunch US supporter in the region. Foxconn, a Taiwanese conglomerate known for being Apple’s main contractor, is building manufacturing capacity in India, while Pegatron, another Taiwan business that makes parts of iPhones and computers, is investing in Vietnam.\nKing Yuan Electronics Corp., a Taiwanese company specializing in semiconductor testing and packaging, said last month that it would sell off its $670 million stake in a venture in the eastern Chinese city of Suzhou. KYEC cited geopolitics, the US export ban on advanced chips to China and Beijing’s policy of seeking self-sufficiency in the technology.\n“The ecological environment of semiconductor manufacturing in China has changed, and the market competition has become increasingly severe,” KYEC said in a statement.\nExports of semiconductors, electronic components and computer equipment from Taiwan to the US more than tripled from 2018 to reach nearly $37 billion last year. It's not just tech: The island more than tripled exports of tapioca and its substitute, key ingredients in boba milk tea, to the US between 2018 and 2023 and is shipping more fruits, tree nuts and farmed fish.\nThe recent trade data reflect “the strategy from both Taiwan and the US to reorient that trade in an effort to de-risk from China,” said Hung Tran, a nonresident senior fellow with the Atlantic Council’s GeoEconomics Center.\nThe share of Taiwan’s exports to mainland China and Hong Kong fell from about 44 percent in 2020 to less than one-third in the first quarter of 2024. That was “a very big movement,” Tran said. \"And I think that the share (of exports to mainland China and Hong Kong) will probably continue to decline.”\nSince the 1990s, Beijing has tried to balance its claim over the island with favorable economic and trade policies, aiming to foster closer ties that could make it harder for Taiwan to break away.\nWhen the independent-leaning Democratic Progressive Party gained power in Taiwan in 2016, the new government put forward a policy to distance the island from the mainland and boost economic ties with other countries in the region, especially in Southeast Asia. Unhappy Beijing turned to its economic leverage to try to bring Taiwan to heel.\nIt has restricted travel by mainland tourists to the island and suspended imports of Taiwanese seafood, fruits and snacks. In 2021, China banned Taiwan-grown pineapples over biosecurity concerns, devastating Taiwanese farmers whose exported fruit nearly all went to the mainland.\nRalph Cossa, president emeritus of the Honolulu-based foreign policy research institute Pacific Forum, said Beijing’s actions have helped push the island away.\nChinese President “Xi Jinping is tactically clever but strategically foolish in many of the decisions he has made; his loyalty tests on Taiwan businessmen and other heavy-handed business practices and decisions have been a major contributor to the success of Taiwan’s” policy to distance itself from China, he said.\nAnd that policy will continue with Lai Ching-te, the island's new president, Cossa said.\nTags:\n#International\nKeywords:\nChina-Taiwan Trade\nUS-Taiwan Trade\nChina economy\nComputer Chip\nSHARE\nURL berhasil di salin."

President Joko \"Jokowi\" Widodo's call to reduce imports in government procurement has effectively increased the use of domestic products.\nAccording to Irwan Herniwan, the Chief Secretary of the Government Goods and Services Procurement Policy Agency (LKPP), over the past year, the government increased the utilization of made-in-Indonesia products in public procurement&nbsp;by 32.3 percent. In 2022, the value of products made in Indonesia used in government procurement was Rp 440.2 trillion, which rose to Rp 582 trillion in 2023.\n“The affirmative policies to foster the use of domestic products and reserve the government procurement market have positively impacted various economic aspects,” Irwan said.\nFurthermore, Irwan detailed the increase in procurement spending for micro and small enterprises by the government. In 2023, the realization of this spending increased to Rp 275.7 trillion, equivalent to a 52.1 percent&nbsp;increase from the previous year.\nAdvertisement\nIn 2019, President Jokowi criticized his ministries and public agencies for relying too heavily on imported goods for procurement instead of using made-in-Indonesia products.

    "content": "Jakarta\n. Bank Indonesia (BI) is anticipated to increase its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points during the upcoming Board of Governors meeting next Wednesday.\nHans Kwee, Co-Founder of Pasardana, said that the central bank&nbsp;previously raised its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to 6 percent in October 2023, in response to The Fed's higher for longer policy. He suggested that BI might take a similar step again amidst the weakening rupiah. Currently, the rupiah's exchange rate remains weak at around Rp 16,000 per dollar.\n\"The indications were the same as The Fed's higher for longer policy, so if the rupiah weakens, BI might raise it by 25 basis points,\" Hans Kwee told Investor Daily TV on Wednesday.\nThe \"higher for longer\" policy refers to the Fed's&nbsp;approach of keeping interest rates higher for an extended period. This policy aims to maintain control over inflation and ensure economic stability.\nAdvertisement\nAccording to Hans, a 25 basis point increase in the interest rate will attract capital inflows into the Indonesian financial market and raise the yield of Indonesian bonds.\nHe mentioned that despite facing challenges like inflation contributing to the rupiah's depreciation, Indonesia's economy remains resilient. \"If we look at economic growth, it is still good, inflation is still within target. The trade balance is still surplus, but external factors are putting pressure on the rupiah,\" Hans emphasized.\nMeanwhile, the Composite Stock Price Index at the Indonesia Stock Exchange rebounded at the opening of trading on Wednesday, following a 2 percent&nbsp;drop in the previous day's trading due to escalating conflicts in the Middle East. Additionally, the inflation rate in the United States exceeded expectations.\n\"In the short or daily term of trading, we will certainly be speculative on several banking stocks because this sector is the most neutral when interest rates remain high,\" Hans said.\nAccording to Hans, banking stocks worth considering include Bank Mandiri (BMRI), Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BBRI), Bank Central Asia (BBCA), and Bank Negara Indonesia (BBNI).\nFor the medium term, he recommended commodity stocks, especially gold, which experienced significant trading growth. He projected that the global gold price could reach $2,400 per ounce as many central banks, including China, are adjusting their policies.\n\"They are trying to reduce their reliance on the US dollar as foreign exchange reserves and switch to gold, leading to global gold buying amid escalating geopolitical tensions,\" explained Hans.\nAs risks rise, Hans said investors tend to shift towards safe-haven assets like gold. Companies worth considering include Aneka Tambang (ANTM), Merdeka Copper Gold (MDKA), and J Resources Asia Pasifik (PSAB), which could be attractive options for medium-term investors.\n\"Gold is one of our preferred choices, and companies like Antam are worth considering because they are expected to continue to have growth potential,\" he concluded.\nTags:\n#Economic Impacts\n#Economy\nKeywords:\nBank Indonesia\nBI Rate\ninterest rate\nrupiah\nSHARE\nURL berhasil di salin."

    "content": "Washington.\nTreasury Secretary Janet Yellen warned Tuesday of potential global economic damage from rising tensions in the Middle East and pledged that the US and its allies won't hesitate to use their sanctions powers to address Iran's \"malign and destabilizing activity” in the region.\nShe made her remarks ahead of this week's spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, saying Iran's weekend missile attack on Israel “underscores the importance of Treasury’s work to use our economic tools to counter Iran’s malign activity.”\nShe added: “From this weekend’s attack to the Houthi attacks in the Red Sea, Iran’s actions threaten the region’s stability and could cause economic spillovers.”\nIran's missile attack on Israel early Sunday came in response to what it says was an Israeli strike on Iran's consulate in Syria earlier this month. Israel’s military chief said Monday that his country will respond to the attack, while world leaders caution against retaliation, trying to avoid a spiral of violence.\nAdvertisement\nAs the IMF and its fellow lending agency, the World Bank, hold their spring meetings this week, high on the agenda are the fast-rising tensions between Iran and Israel and what escalation could spell for the global economy.\nIsrael and Iran have been on a collision course throughout Israel’s six-month war against Hamas militants in Gaza. The war erupted after two militant groups backed by Iran led an attack on Oct. 7 that killed 1,200 people in Israel and kidnapped 250 others. An Israeli offensive in Gaza has caused widespread devastation and killed over 33,000 people, according to local health officials.\n“We’ve targeted over 500 individuals and entities connected to terrorism and terrorist financing by the Iranian regime and its proxies since the start of the Administration,\" Yellen said, citing sanctions against Iran’s drone and missile programs, militant groups Hamas, the Houthis, Hezbollah, and other Iraqi militia groups.\n“Treasury will not hesitate to work with our allies to use our sanctions authority to continue disrupting the Iranian regime’s malign and destabilizing activity,” she said. “I fully expect we will take additional sanctions actions against Iran in the coming days.\"\nThe annual gathering will take place as other ongoing conflicts, including Russia's invasion of Ukraine, threaten global financial stability.\nYellen in February offered her strongest public support yet for the idea of liquidating roughly $300 billion in frozen Russian Central Bank assets and using them for Ukraine’s long-term reconstruction.\nShe said Tuesday that the US is “continuing to work with our international partners to unlock the economic value of immobilized Russian sovereign assets and ensure that Russia pays for the damage it has caused.” Yellen added that she will meet with Group of Seven finance leaders Wednesday to continue discussions on the topic and will look at “a series of possibilities, ranging from actually seizing the assets to using them as collateral.”\nAnother major issue for this year's meetings on the US side, Yellen said, will be ongoing conversations about Chinese industrial policy that poses a threat to US jobs and the global economy. She traveled to Guangzhou and Beijing earlier this month, to hold “difficult conversations” with counterparts over what she describes as China's overcapacity in its wave of low-priced Chinese green tech exports that could overwhelm factories in the U.S. and make it impossible to compete.\nYellen said she plans to meet later this week with her Chinese counterparts for a fourth meeting of the US-China Economic and Financial Working Groups, \"to share information, identify potential areas of cooperation, and, when we disagree, frankly communicate concerns.”\nUS Treasury and China’s Ministry of Finance launched the economic working groups in an effort to ease tensions and deepen ties between the nations.\nTags:\n#International\nKeywords:\nIranian Drones\nIran Attacks Israel\nJanet Yellen\nMiddle East conflict\nIran vs Israel\nSHARE\nURL berhasil di salin."

    "content": "Guangzhou, China.\nUS Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen called on China on Friday to address manufacturing overcapacity that she said could cause global economic dislocation and to create a level playing field for American companies and workers.\nStarting a five-day visit to China in one of the country’s major industrial and export hubs, she said she would raise industrial overcapacity and what the US considers to be unfair Chinese trade practices during what will likely be tough talks with senior China officials.\n“There are a broad swath of economic interactions” between the US and China “that should remain uncontroversial,” she said at an event hosted by the American Chamber of Commerce in China in Guangzhou. But, she said, there are “Chinese practices tilting the playing field away” from US firms.\nYellen, the first Cabinet-level official to visit China since President Joe Biden met Chinese leader Xi Jinping last November, earlier told the governor of Guangdong province that it's important for the US and China to have open and direct communication on areas of disagreement.\nAdvertisement\n\"This includes the issue of China’s industrial overcapacity, which the United States and other countries are concerned can cause global spillovers,” she said.\nAfter meeting the governor, Yellen spoke with US business leaders at the American Chamber event and took questions from them in an auditorium of a marbled convention center in the Baiyun District of Guangzhou.\n“I’ve heard from many American business executives that operating in China can be challenging,” Yellen said at an event hosted by the American Chamber of Commerce in China on Friday afternoon.\nCiting a recent survey by the Chamber that found that a third of American firms in China say they have experienced unfair treatment compared to local competitors, Yellen said the US has seen China “pursue unfair economic practices, including imposing barriers to access for foreign firms and taking coercive actions against American companies.”\n“I strongly believe that this doesn’t only hurt these American firms: ending these unfair practices would benefit China by improving the business climate here. I intend to raise these issues in meetings this week,” she said in her speech.\nEarlier in the day, she also met with American, European and Japanese business representatives to hear their concerns.\nGuangzhou is the capital of Guangdong province, a Chinese manufacturing and export hub that is home to telecom giant Huawei and BYD, China’s largest EV maker. Huawei has been hit hard by US restrictions on semiconductor exports to China and is at the vanguard of Chinese efforts to become self-sufficient and a leader in technology.\nGovernment subsidies and other policy support have encouraged solar panel and EV makers in China to invest in factories, building far more production capacity than the domestic market can absorb.\nThe massive scale of production has driven down costs and ignited price wars for green technologies, a boon for consumers and efforts to reduce global dependence on fossil fuels. But Western governments fear that that capacity will flood their markets with low-priced exports, threatening American and European jobs.\nYellen will head to Beijing next.\nTags:\n#International\nKeywords:\nJanet Yellen\nUS-China trade talks\nAmerican Chamber of Commerce\nSHARE\nURL berhasil di salin."

    "content": "Jakarta\n. Indonesia ranks 109th out of 181 countries in DHL's latest global connectivity report. This figure is far below neighboring countries such as Singapore, which holds the top spot, and Malaysia, which ranks 26th.\nThis ranking is outlined in the DHL and Stern School of Business, New York University's Global Connectedness Index 2024 report, presented in New Delhi, India, on Wednesday, March 13. The report thoroughly examines the state and trajectory of globalization, including tracking how trade, capital, information, and people move around the world.\nThe report indicates that Indonesia still lags significantly in its level of connectivity compared to neighboring countries. However, the report emphasizes the immense potential for further increasing global flows.&nbsp;\nAccording to the report, the current level of globalization is&nbsp;only at 25 percent, on a scale from 0 percent (meaning no flows cross national borders) to 100 percent (where borders and distances cease to be relevant).\nAdvertisement\nTrade growth plays a crucial role in boosting global connectivity. The share of global output traded internationally reached a record high in 2022. After experiencing a slowdown in 2023, trade growth is projected to pick up again in 2024.\n\"Deglobalization is still only a risk, not a current reality. Geopolitical threats and policy shifts have led many to predict a fracturing of the world economy along geographic or geopolitical lines, or even a retreat from international to domestic business. But the latest data still show that international flows are growing and very few countries are cutting ties with their traditional counterparts,\" explained Steven Altman, Senior Researcher and Director of DHL's Globalization Initiative at the Stern School of Business, New York University.\n\"It is important to recognize the resilience of global flows because a lopsided focus on the threats to globalization could make deglobalization a self-fulfilling prophecy,\" he added.\nFurthermore, Altman explained that globalization reached a record high in 2022 and remained close to that level in 2023—despite a series of global shocks over the past decade, including the Covid-19 pandemic, wars in Ukraine and Gaza, and trade conflicts between the United States and China, as well as the UK's exit from the EU.\n\"These pieces of evidence firmly refute the notion that global flow growth has regressed,\" he said.\nMeanwhile, DHL Express CEO John Pearson, said&nbsp;there are opportunities for development in each country to enhance global connectivity.\n\"It's about resilient and strong level of global connectedness. Being more interconnected is immense because it opens up numerous opportunities for building a better world,\" said John.\nHe further stated that market expansion and opportunity development will empower individuals, businesses, and entire countries to develop in unique ways.\nThis edition of the DHL Global Connectedness Report tracked the globalization of 181 countries from 2001 to 2022 based on nearly 9 million data points.&nbsp;\nTags:\n#Economy\nKeywords:\nDHL\nGlobal Connectedness Report\nglobalization\nSHARE\nURL berhasil di salin."

    "content": "Jakarta.\nNickel-based batteries are still not losing popularity to lithium ferro-phosphate (LFP) in the electric vehicle (EV) market, according to Investment Minister Bahlil Lahadalia.\nIndonesia has been banking on its gigantic nickel reserves as a means to penetrate the global EV supply chain. But Thomas Lembong, a senior member of the Anies Baswedan presidential campaign team, said earlier that EV giant Tesla was shifting from nickel-based batteries to the much cheaper, China-made LFP batteries.\nVice presidential candidate Gibran Rakabuming, who had promised to carry on existing policies on Indonesian nickel, brought up Thomas’s criticism at Sunday's debate. Gibran asked his rival Muhaimin Iskandar -- Anies' ticket mate -- whether he was “anti-nickel” just like Thomas. This later made the “nickel-based batteries versus its LFP counterparts” a hot topic.\nFast forward to Wednesday, Bahlil tried to dispel doubts over nickel’s popularity following Thomas’s comments.\nAdvertisement\n“So it is a lie that the [EV industry] is leaving nickel,” Bahlil told reporters in Jakarta on Wednesday.\nBahlil then compared LFP and NMC -- an EV battery type that combines nickel, manganese, and cobalt. He added: “Tesla is only using LFP batteries for its standard models. Because&nbsp;NMC-powered cars can travel longer distances [compared to their LFP counterparts]. Some Tesla cars are still using nickel-based batteries.”\nEV producers Hyundai, Tesla, Volkswagen, Volvo, and BMW, among others, are using NMC batteries. Cars produced by BYD, Wuling, and Chery, use LFP batteries. Tesla only uses LFP for its vehicles made in China. Ford adopts both LFP and NMC batteries, according to the Investment Ministry.\nSlides shown during the presser revealed that LFP-powered cars could travel about 700 kilometers, versus NMC’s 1,000-kilometer range. An LFP battery is cheaper at an average price of $70-80/KWh. This is about 20-30 percent less compared to NMC’s price range of between $90 and $100/KWh.&nbsp;\nIndonesia reported that it had attracted approximately $42 billion in investment for its EV battery ecosystem. About $9.8 billion came from South Korean battery manufacturer LG Energy Solution. China’s CATL has also invested $5.2 billion in the ecosystem.\nHenchman for Other Countries\nChina is the world's largest phosphate producer. Phosphate represents 61 percent of LFP battery content. Indonesia, however, does not produce this rock. About 80 percent of NMC is made of nickel, according to the Investment Ministry. Indonesia is home to the world's largest nickel reserves, standing at 21 million metric tons.\nIn 2020, Indonesia stopped exporting unprocessed nickel ores in a move to build an EV battery ecosystem. The export ban angered the stainless steel-producing European Union (EU) who later sued Indonesia at the World Trade Organization (WTO). The International Monetary Fund (IMF) last year even asked Indonesia to phase out export restrictions and refrain from replicating the ban on other commodities. Indonesia’s nickel domestic processing policy is also starting to receive criticism from politicians at home, including Thomas.\n\"Let me ask you this: do we want to focus on developing our natural resources or promote other countries' products?\" Bahlil said.\n“Remember how the IMF told us to not ban exports of unprocessed ores? Be careful. I’m connecting the dots here. Don’t let any foreign country’s henchman disrupt our public policies,” Bahlil said.\nThomas headed the country’s investment agency during President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo’s first term.\nTags:\n#Energy &amp; Minerals\nKeywords:\nBahlil Lahadalia\nInvestment Minister\nnickel\nNickel Manganese Cobalt\nNMC Batteries\nLFP Batteries\nThomas Lembong\nEV Battery\nTesla\nHyundai\nBYD\nSHARE\nURL berhasil di salin."

The&nbsp;composite share price index of the Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX) saw a minor dip of 0.17 percent, reaching 7,260 in the early stages of trading on the first day of the new year. Investors are keenly monitoring the release of inflation data later in the day.\nVice President Ma'ruf Amin officially opened the first day of stock trading in 2024 at the IDX. Ma'ruf Amin said that&nbsp;2023 was marked by various challenges, but Indonesia successfully navigated through them.\n\"In a period where many countries experienced economic turbulence due to inflationary pressures, commodity price fluctuations, and geopolitical fragmentation, Indonesia managed to overcome these challenges. It underscores the need for anticipation and a flexible, measured, and reliable policy response, particularly in the fiscal and monetary domains,\" he said on Tuesday.\nAnalysts at NH Korindo Sekuritas Indonesia Research predict that today's trading volume will stay relatively subdued, indicating the potential for the index to test its closest support level at 7,220.&nbsp;\nAdvertisement\n\"After a two-month upward trend, the index seems to be entering a consolidation phase,\" NHKSI wrote in its research note on Monday. A total of 1.6 billion shares, valued at Rp 628.5 billion, exchanged hands in the first 15 minutes of trading.\nAs investors and traders kick off the trading year in 2024, attention is turning to December's inflation data, projected to be at 2.72 percent&nbsp;year-on-year, a slight decrease from November's 2.86 percent. Core inflation is also expected to ease slightly to 1.85 percent&nbsp;year-on-year.\nGlobal markets are closely monitoring signals from the US Federal Reserve, with expectations of rate cuts starting in March. Investors are pricing in over 150 basis points of easing by the Fed, the European Central Bank, and the Bank of England in the coming year.\nAccording to a research projection by RHB Sekuritas, the index is anticipated to reach 7,900 in 2024, driven by the expectations of interest rate reductions and a peaceful 2024 general election. Historically, the index has demonstrated volatility in the year preceding elections, often followed by an upward trend in the subsequent years.\nRHB is also anticipating a 50 basis points reduction in Bank Indonesia's (BI) interest rates in the second half of 2024, which could assist the banking sector in managing costs more efficiently. Interest rate cuts also have the potential to boost the net interest margin of the banking sector.\nRHB&nbsp;maintains its projection for Indonesia's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth in 2024 at 5 percent, with private consumption expenditures as the main driver. Additionally, the Rupiah is expected to gradually strengthen to the range of Rp 15,000 to Rp 15,600 against the Dollar.\nAnother contributing factor is the expectation of economic recovery in China. RHB believes that China's economic rebound will benefit Indonesia's basic metal sectors, such as copper and nickel, along with an increased demand for paper packaging.\nLooking back at 2023, the IDX displayed robust growth of 6.1 percent, closing at 7,272. The capitalization of Indonesia's stock market reached Rp 11,762 trillion, reflecting a 23.82 percent&nbsp;year-to-date increase compared to the end of 2022 at Rp 9,499 trillion. By December 28, 2023, the total number of investors in Indonesia's capital market reached 12.15 million, indicating a 17.16% year-to-date increase from the end of 2022.&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\nTags:\n#Economy\nKeywords:\nIDX\nstock market\nSHARE\nURL berhasil di salin."

The joint trilateral Global Combat Air Program is a “historic program,” he said, that enables the three countries to work together to create a new fighter jet while reducing risks.\nUnder the plan, a joint body called the International Government Organization will manage the private sector joint venture -- which includes Japan’s Mitsubishi Heavy, Britain’s BAE Systems PLC and Italy’s Leonardo -- to oversee the aircraft's development. The organization is tasked with distributing work in different areas, such as the engine and avionics.\nThe organization, known as GIGO, will be headquartered in Britain and headed by a Japanese official, and the joint venture will be led by an Italian representative, Kihara said. The top posts will rotate every few years, Japanese defense officials said.\nJapan is moving ahead despite delayed approval at home to ease its current policy that bans the export of lethal weapons. The restriction under Japan’s postwar pacifist Constitution does not allow the country to sell a jointly developed fighter jet and possibly complicates the project, since Britain and Italy hope to be able to sell the new combat aircraft.\nA Japanese government panel has been discussing the easing of military sales and agreed to relax restrictions on the transfer of licensed technology and equipment. But it recently postponed a decision on easing the policy for the joint fighter jet until early next year.\nDefense officials refused to discuss how the situation would possibly affect the joint project.\nThe project is the first time Japan will participate in a multinational organization to jointly develop new military equipment.\nTo counter growing threats from China, North Korea and Russia, Japan has been expanding its defense partnerships with countries in Europe, Southeast Asia and the Indo-Pacific, including Australia and the Philippines.\nTags:\n#International\nKeywords:\nFigher Jet\nJoint Fighter Jet Project\nMitsubishi F-X\nMinoru Kihara\nGIGO\nSHARE\nURL berhasil di salin."

    "content": "Jakarta.\nAn expert said Tuesday that Indonesia could leverage the diaspora’s potential to supercharge bilateral trade with their country of residence rather than urging them to return home.\nMillions of Indonesians are living abroad. According to Khairur Rizki, an international relations lecturer at Mataram University, the diaspora community can deliver economic benefits to Indonesia despite being far away from home. For instance, they can help promote trade and investment.\n“Diasporas can become a bridge and develop the business or economic potentials between Indonesia and the host country. … They can be the trading agents,” Khairur told a forum hosted by Foreign Policy Community of Indonesia (FPCI) in Jakarta on Tuesday.\n“Instead of urging them to return, let the diaspora Indonesians&nbsp;grow their potential overseas. If possible, [the government] can facilitate [the diasporas] to develop their career and potential,\"&nbsp;Khairur said.\nAdvertisement\nA 2022 report by the Foreign Affairs Ministry shows that most Indonesian nationals overseas are in the Asian region, standing at around 1.6 million people. Followed by Europe (88,533 people) and the Americas (66,868 people). The Australian continent hosts 62,610 Indonesian citizens. There are 21,496 Indonesians in Africa.\nAccording to Khairur, the diaspora community can also strengthen Indonesia’s sports diplomacy as a means to promote tourism.\n“Surfing is one of the sports that not many countries can do, but Indonesia can. We can harness surfing potential by asking our diasporas to talk about Indonesian surfing in their host countries. We can send our surfing athletes overseas,” Khairur said.\n“By promoting surfing, the number of travelers coming to Indonesia is expected to increase. We can also hold international events,” Khairur told the forum.\nIndonesia is aiming to attract 8.5 million foreign travelers this year. Indonesia already reached that target as of September. The government also reported that the tourism sector accounted for 3.6 percent of Indonesia’s gross domestic product (GDP) as of 2022.&nbsp;\nDiaspora&nbsp;and Indonesia’s Halal Industry\nIndonesia today is starting to notice diaspora’ potential for the economy as the Muslim-majority country tries to develop its halal industry. Vice President Ma’ruf Amin earlier this year said that the diaspora community could pave the way for Indonesia’s goal of becoming a major halal industry player.\n“We [Indonesia] represent the world’s largest halal consumer market. Indonesia is aiming to be the largest halal goods producer in the world. This is where the Indonesian diaspora&nbsp;and businesses overseas come in. It is not just production and meeting the global standards, but the marketing [of our halal products] is also important,” Ma’ruf told Indonesian diaspora and halal goods entrepreneurs in Japan back in March.\n“The Japanese government is eyeing to expand its halal industry as more foreign Muslim travelers visit Japan,” Ma’ruf said.\nThe 2021/2022 Indonesia Halal Markets Report revealed the country’s domestic spending across halal economy products and services reached $184 billion in 2020. The numbers will likely hit $281.6 billion by 2025. The report shows that Indonesia exported $8.6 billion worth of halal products to fellow Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) markets in 2020. However, Indonesia is still lagging behind the non-OIC leading exporter China ($25.4 billion).\nTags:\n#International\n#Economy\nKeywords:\nIndonesian Diasporas\nIndonesian Diaspora\nIndonesians Living Abroad\nForeign Trade\nSHARE\nURL berhasil di salin."

    "content": "APEC Economic Leaders’ Meeting was successfully held on November 16 and 17, 2023, in San Francisco. The event was organized under the main theme of Creating a Resilient and Sustainable Future for All in a recognition that a fragmented APEC will only jeopardize all cooperation and collaboration among APEC’s 21 economies to maintain their trajectory to recover from poly-crisis confronting the region for the last three years or so.&nbsp;\nAs put by Statista on 20 April 2023, we have been witnessing a great continental shift where the gravity of economic power moves significantly to Asia, and Indonesia is amongst a few Asian countries that will make its way to the center of gravity. Indonesia recently entered the group of 10 largest economies in terms of Purchasing Power Parity. The fourth-largest country by population is destined to become the sixth-largest economy by 2028, provided that the country is able to accelerate its growth trajectory. There is no exaggeration to submit that the “Asian century” is in the making, and Indonesia together with China and India is at the center of such a great shift in the modern history of humankind.&nbsp;\nSeen from such a perspective, Indonesia’s intensified engagement at the regional and international stages should not be belittled. Last year, Indonesia was praised for its role as the host of the G-20 Summit and the chair of ASEAN. Indonesia’s participation in the G-7 Summit in Hiroshima last May, the BRICS Summit in Johannesburg last August, and the third Summit of the Belt Road Forum in China last October, as well as the holding of the first-ever Archipelagic and Island States Forum in Bali also in October -- to name just a few -- is a clear testament to Indonesia’s strong quest for a bigger role in regional and global issues that will impact on Indonesia’s future.&nbsp;\nSuch a profile was further heightened when President Joko Widodo visited the United States for APEC Economic Leaders’ Summit and some bilateral meetings organized on the sidelines of the Summit. While the main agenda of any APEC meetings and summits is always regional and global economy and related issues, members of this non-binding regional grouping usually take up non-economic issues either at the group or bilateral levels. APEC Leaders’ gathering in the United States this year is no exception.&nbsp;\nAdvertisement\nOne particular issue on which Indonesia made its stanch crystal-clear to its APEC partners is the ongoing genocide of Palestinians by Israel in Gaza. Before raising the issue at the Summit, President Joko Widodo managed to convey his messages and strong views on conflicts in Gaza to President Joe Biden on 13 November 2023 in the White House. It was reported that after the meeting, and due to similar pressures from others, President Joe Biden sent out a blunt message to Tel Aviv that Israel’s effort to occupy Gaza is a big blunder. What we witnessed in the following days is Israel easing access to Gaza for humanitarian supplies.\nAs the saying goes, respect is something to be earned -- not claimed. It is plausible therefore to believe that strengthened Indonesia’s posture in the international arena is the result of the world-class performance of Indonesian diplomats and negotiators combined with Indonesia’s remarkable achievements at home. For sure, the former could not have materialized should the latter is not observable. Perhaps among the most salient successes of the current government in managing the country is in the economic sphere, particularly in response to the continued trade war between the United States and China and all of its adverse impacts on other countries, the global economic stalemate caused by Covid-19, and continued global uncertainties as a result of the war in Ukraine and geo-political rivalries among major powers.&nbsp;\nIndonesia managed to go through a difficult and complex reform process in the last ten years. This includes but is not limited to overhauling the fuel subsidy scheme, developing infrastructure in physically challenging areas, simplifying hundreds of laws and regulations through the omnibus law in order to cut down established practices of red tape, reforming the health sector, developing the processing industries to climb up the ladder of value chains, and other measures including those that were unpopular at first. As a result, Indonesia was able to maintain an average economic growth of 5 percent in the last ten years, and per capita income has more than tripled from $1,222 in 2004 to $4,580 in 2022. What has been missing from the observation of many critics is that such an accomplishment was made through the difficult time of Covid-19 and the great disruption of global value chains never encountered by the previous governments.&nbsp;\nLooking forward, Indonesia could and should position itself better and bolder on the global economic map. Some challenges await and they need to be addressed as&nbsp;soon as possible if Indonesia is to maintain its strong growth and development trajectory. Domestically, the fourth-most populous country needs to urgently capitalize on its demographic dividend since such a bonus will turn into a liability by the early 2030s if the Indonesian government misses the opportunity to improve its education system and boost the capacity of its young generation. Another domestic challenge is establishing a good regulatory practice to create policy certainty deemed by national and foreign businesses and investors to be in short supply. Yet, another task is equally challenging: keep the economy open and keep opening the economy.\nIt is perhaps the most popular proposition for Indonesia to be more inward-looking and adopt a protectionist policy. At times when globalization is challenged these days by its own proponents and winners, a call for raising barriers to trade and investment is quite appealing. However, as Adam Smith described it in his book “Wealth of Nations” published in 1776, countries will continue to exchange with one another to meet demands that cannot be met by local supplies. There has been indeed an unprecedented disruption to the global value chains, but at the same time, we can observe the rise of a new variant of global value chains where countries with shared economic and geo-strategic interests collaborate to create what they commonly dub a resilient supply chain. This is what the United States has been championing since early 2022, that is, to invite like-minded countries to join the Indo-Pacific Economic Partnership for Prosperity or IPEF. There are 13 countries joining US-led IPEF: Australia, Fiji, India, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea and seven ASEAN member states of Brunei Darussalam, the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam.\nIt is unfortunate that the trade pillar of IPEF could not be concluded during the APEC Leaders’ week in San Francisco due to domestic political considerations in Washington DC. But perhaps it is high time for Indonesia to focus instead on the full and faithful implementation of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership or RCEP. The agreement was signed on November 15, 2020, among Australia, China, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea and all the 10 ASEAN Member States. RCEP was first introduced by Indonesia in 2011 to its ASEAN colleagues. After gaining support from all ASEAN FTA Partners, the RCEP negotiation was launched in November 2012 in Phnom Phen -- Cambodia, and the first substantive negotiation commenced in May 2013 in Brunei Darussalam.\nThe implementation of RCEP has become effective since June 2023 for all its parties except Myanmar. It is considered the largest trade bloc ever due to its size in terms of RCEP shares to world GDP, trade, investment and market or population. Some analysts predicted that it would offer significant economic gains for signatory nations, boost economic recovery, and pull the economic center of gravity back towards Asia. In fact, the strategic importance of RCEP in today’s geopolitical tensions cannot be underestimated. In their assessment of the agreement, Professor Peter Petri and Professor Michael Plummer maintained in the Brookings Institution Journal in November 2020 that the RCEP will link around 30 percent of the world’s output and people and, in the right political settings, will generate significant gains: adding $209 billion annually to world incomes and $500 billion to global trade by 2030.&nbsp;\nComparing RCEP and the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership or CPTPP, Petri and Plummer further argued that the two agreements could offset global losses from the US-China trade war, although not for China and the United States. The agreements will allow the economies of North and Southeast Asia more efficient by linking their strengths in technology, manufacturing, agriculture, and natural resources. Although RCEP is not as rigorous as the CPTPP, the two Professors believed that RCEP will incentivize supply chains across the region while catering to political sensitivities.\nIn the context of better positioning itself in the future global economic map, Indonesia needs to develop a robust internal and external agenda to meet the vision of Indonesia's Golden Year 2050. This requires not only the right policy-mix to address the short and medium-term challenges, but also a strong leadership with the right world views who knows the way, shows the way, and leads the way.\n---\nIman Pambagyo is a former Director General of International Trade Negotiation of the Trade Ministry and a former Indonesian Ambassador to the World Trade Organization.

    "date": "2023-11-09 01:30:00",
    "content": "Jakarta.\nPresidential candidate Anies Baswedan recently said Indonesia’s foreign affairs policy has&nbsp;so far been transactional and the former Jakarta Governor intends to pursue what he calls a “value-based foreign policy” if he becomes Indonesia’s next leader.\nAccording to Anies, Indonesia’s international relations have been putting too much emphasis on securing measurable benefits, for instance, investment deals. Being one of the world’s largest democracies, Indonesia should have also played a more proactive role on the global stage.\n“Many believe Indonesia adopts a transactional foreign policy. So Indonesia only does something if the foreign matters in question can give Indonesia investment and trade benefits, not because it is part of our responsibility as a global citizen,” Anies told a forum hosted by think-tank Central Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) in Jakarta on Wednesday.\n“The future foreign policy that I envision is a paradigm shift from what is currently transactional to something that is value-based,” Anies said.\nAdvertisement\nThe National Democratic Party (Nasdem) presidential nominee then listed what sort of values his dream foreign policy upholds. They include the primacy of human life and environmental stewardship. Anies said: “If we don’t have values, we will only talk about the profit or loss.”\nPresident Joko “Jokowi” Widodo’s foreign policy has been undeniably investment and trade-oriented. Jokowi often tries to attract foreign investment when meeting world leaders as Indonesia pursues the domestic processing of its natural resources. Jokowi believes having the processing plants in the country can help create jobs. Indonesia will also get to enjoy greater economic benefits by exporting value-added goods rather than unprocessed natural commodities, according to Jokowi.\nAnies aims to lower Indonesia’s poverty rate to 4-5 percent by 2029 if elected as president. He seeks to bring down extreme poverty to zero percent by 2026.\nFood Shortage and Russia-Ukraine War\nAlso, Anies commented on how Indonesia responded to the Russia-Ukraine war. His statement alluded to Jokowi’s trip to Kyiv-Moscow, which was in an attempt to stop the war that had taken a toll on global food supplies.\n“We [Indonesia] tend to pursue narrow interests in our international relations. Take a look [at how we handle Russian] invasion against Ukraine. When we went there [to Ukraine and Russia], we spoke of securing our food supply chain. But this is something that is bigger than food supply,” Anies said.&nbsp;\nJokowi went on a peace mission to the two warring countries in mid-2022. This was about four months after Russia launched a full-scale invasion against Ukraine.&nbsp;During the visit, Jokowi offered to bridge communication between Russia’s Vladimir Putin and his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\nThe talks also revolved around the war-induced food shortages, with Jokowi saying that 207 million tons of wheat could not be shipped out of Russia and Ukraine. Sometime after the peace mission, Jokowi admitted that it was unlikely for the two presidents to have a dialogue at the time.\n“I actually wanted to create a space for dialogue. But after seeing what was happening on the ground, it wasn't easy to arrange a dialogue between Putin and Zelenskyy. That is why I turned the discussions to the food crisis,\" Jokowi said in a forum with the Indonesian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (Kadin) last August.&nbsp;\nLater that year, the leaders of the world’s top economies gathered in Bali for the G20 Summit. The Bali leaders’ declaration writes that the G20 members had reiterated their national positions and deplored “in the strongest terms the aggression by the Russian Federation against Ukraine”. This was stronger in language compared to what the subsequent G20 New Delhi Summit issued. The New Delhi document did not overtly condemn Russia’s invasion, only referring to it as “the war in Ukraine”.&nbsp;\nSenior economist Yose Rizal Damuri applauded Anies’ foreign policy ideas, saying that Indonesia can still pursue its economic interests without becoming too transactional in its global interactions.\n“When we are not too transactional, we do not only focus on trade matters. It is a broader economic diplomacy that can bring us more benefits -- perhaps not in the short term, but in the long run,” Yose told the Globe shortly after the conference.\nRead More:&nbsp;\nIt’s Impossible to Rely on China Alone, Presidential Hopeful Ganjar Says\nTags:\n#Politics\n#International\nKeywords:\nanies baswedan\nPresidential Candidate\nforeign policy\nIndonesian foreign policy\nCSIS\njokowi\nRussia-Ukraine War\nSHARE\nURL berhasil di salin."

    "content": "Bali\n. India and Pakistan heavily rely on the import of crude palm oil (CPO) from Indonesia, but export restrictions imposed last year have raised concerns in both countries about the supply of CPO from Indonesia.\nIn April 2022, Indonesia implemented a ban on the export of CPO&nbsp; due to a shortage of cooking oil in the domestic market. This move surprised India, which heavily relies on Indonesia for palm oil supplies, with imports totaling 5 million tons in 2022. The policy has since been lifted in May 2022 with the normalization of cooking oil supplies domestically.\nConsumption of vegetable oil in India and Pakistan continues to rise, driven by a high population growth rate and a lack of domestic vegetable oil production. According to the Executive Director of The Solvent Extractors' Association of India, B V Mehta, vegetable oil consumption in India has seen a significant surge. Compared to 2008-2009, vegetable oil consumption in India increased from 14.1 million tons to 22.5 million tons in 2021-2022.\nWhile domestic vegetable oil production is slowing, demand continues to rise, leading India to increase its imports. Palm oil is the primary commodity imported by India, with 60 percent&nbsp;of these imports coming from Indonesia, Malaysia, and a small portion from Thailand.\nAdvertisement\n\"Palm oil is particularly popular in the restaurant and catering sector,\" Mehta said during the Indonesian Palm Oil Conference (IPOC) 2023 in Nusa Dua, Bali, on Friday.\nHigh demand for CPO has prompted India to request a reevaluation of Indonesia's export policies. \"We hope the Indonesian Government can reconsider the current policies,\" he said.\nIn September 2023, a delegation of Indonesian officials, headed by Deputy Trade Minister Jerry Sambuaga, participated in the 2nd Sustainable Vegetable Oils Conference held in Mumbai. The primary objective of this visit was to address and counteract the adverse perceptions surrounding CPO in India, specifically focusing on concerns related to sustainability and the alleged negative health impacts of CPO products among Indian consumers.\nPakistan, like India, is another significant destination for Indonesian palm oil exports, and they also hope for Indonesia to evaluate its palm oil export policies.\nAccording to the Chief Executive of the Pakistan Edible Oil Conference (PEOC) and the Westbury Group,&nbsp;Abdul Rasheed Janmohammed, Pakistan plans to purchase palm oil from Indonesia to meet the increasing demand for vegetable oil in late 2023 and early 2024. Pakistan consumes around 4.5 million tons of vegetable oil, while local production is only about 0.75 tons. This makes Pakistan a country that needs to import approximately 3 million tons of vegetable oil.\nThis demand has increased, especially since Pakistan recently banned genetically modified (GMO) food products, which has limited the supply of vegetable oil.\n\"We hope Indonesia will continue to open the export door to Pakistan because our domestic vegetable oil production is insufficient to meet our needs,\" added Abdul.\nCPO Prices Expected to Return to $1,000 Next Year\nEddy Martono, Chairman of the Indonesian Palm Oil Business Association (Gapki), predicts that palm oil prices could rise in 2024, returning to $1,000 per ton from the current range of around $800 per ton.\nEddy explained that this year's El Nino, although not as severe as in 2015 and 2019, still affects palm oil production. Next year, a 5% reduction in palm oil production is expected. CPO prices have fallen around 17.5 percent&nbsp;from $ 1.005 in April to $ 829 in September.\nAccording to Eddy, the recovery in demand from China, the second-largest palm oil importer after India, will drive CPO prices. Eddy said that Gapki's sales target in China from 2021-2022 has been around 6 million tons. This year, he hopes that the figure can gradually rise to 7 million tons by the end of 2023. In the coming year, the demand for CPO may return to pre-COVID-19 levels, which was about 8 million tons.\n\"What we can see now is an increase in the Chinese market, as it used to be around 8 million tons before Covid-19 but decreased during the pandemic,\" said Eddy during the Indonesian Palm Oil Conference (IPOC) 2023 in Bali, on Friday (11/3/2023).\nThe 19th IPOC took place at the Bali International Convention Center (BICC) from November 1-3, 2023, with the theme \"Enhancing Resilience Amid Market Uncertainty.\"\nIn his address, Minister of Trade Zulhas emphasized the importance of the IPOC event as a platform for policymakers, from the local to the international level, to discuss, exchange ideas, and collaborate in advancing the Indonesian palm oil industry, especially amid the current global uncertainties.\nTags:\n#Economy\n#Commodity\nKeywords:\nIPOC 2023\npalm oil\nSHARE\nURL berhasil di salin."

    "content": "Jakarta.\nOn October 28-29, Japan hosted the G7 Trade Ministers’ Meeting in Osaka. The primary focus of the gathering was improving supply-chain resilience and strengthening export controls on critical minerals and technologies. But China’s “economic coercion,” particularly the widespread disruption caused by its non-transparent and market-distorting industrial policies, was also high on the agenda.\nTo address climate change and the rest of the Sustainable Development Agenda, we must do more to enhance emerging markets’ and developing countries’ revenues, so that they can make the necessary investments. As matters stand, however, international trade and financial arrangements are overwhelmingly arrayed against this goal.\nSince joining the World Trade Organization in 2001, China has repeatedly been accused of providing unfair industrial subsidies, resulting in multiple WTO dispute cases. In 2006, for example, the European Union, the United States, and Canada complained that China was offering export subsidies to its automobile and auto parts industries, primarily through its “export base” programs. The WTO strictly prohibits export subsidies due to their significant trade-distorting effects.\nMoreover, in 2010, the US asserted that China was subsidizing its wind-power equipment manufacturers by offering grants to companies that used Chinese-made components. In 2017, the focus shifted to alleged Chinese subsidies to large aluminum producers. A year later, the WTO vindicated the federal government’s complaint that China was imposing countervailing and anti-dumping duties on broiler products from the US.\nAdvertisement\nMeanwhile, bilateral trade between China and South Korea has declined significantly amid rising geopolitical tensions and following China’s decision to exclude from its subsidies program electric vehicle manufacturers that used South Korean battery packs. Trade relations between China and Australia also soured after China responded to then-Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison’s call for an independent international investigation into the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic by imposing tariffs on Australian goods such as barley, wine, red meat, timber, and lobsters.\nEarlier this year, G7 leaders pledged to combat all forms of economic coercion. But this effort could have far-reaching consequences, given that China accounts for 19.4 percent, 7.5 percent, 6.8 percent, and 6.5 percent of exports from Japan, the US, Germany, and the United Kingdom, respectively. Should the group implement anti-coercion measures targeting China, Chinese President Xi Jinping might retaliate.\nBut, beyond the potential implications for G7 economies, the group’s anti-coercion campaign could negatively affect global trade. For starters, the vagueness of the term “economic coercion” provides an opportunity not just for the G7 but for governments worldwide to use it as a pretext for protectionist measures, which could increase production costs and overall prices.\nThe EU defines economic coercion as an attempt by a non-member state to pressure one or more of its members to take a specific action by implementing or threatening to implement measures that affect trade or investment relations between those countries. But while some tactics and tools are clearly coercive, there is no clear explanation of what constitutes an action “against” another country. Given this ambiguity, the term could apply to policies adopted by many countries.\nMoreover, while the G7 has repeatedly emphasized its view that export controls are a “fundamental policy tool” to prevent critical technologies from being used for military purposes, such measures can distort long-term resource allocation and global trade, undermine competitiveness, and impede economic growth in both exporting and importing countries.\nIn a 1981 study, for example, Princeton economist Gene M. Grossman showed that local content requirements often result in reduced output and higher prices for final goods, though their effects on domestic intermediate goods remain unclear and largely depend on market-specific factors and production processes. In a 1992 paper, Grossman and Elhanan Helpman outlined a trade protection framework in which industries with higher import demand or export-supply elasticities deviate less from free-trade practices. In 2012, Will Martin and Kym Anderson found that shifts in trade policies, especially export restrictions, played a major role in driving up global staple-crop prices during the commodity booms of 1973-74 and 2006-08.\nBy adopting anti-coercion measures, G7 members may inadvertently encourage other countries to erect their own trade barriers. In 2022 alone, governments worldwide introduced nearly 3,000 protectionist measures affecting investment and trade in goods and services. These actions, whether undertaken by individual countries or larger groupings, could exacerbate uncertainty and inhibit global trade.\nThis increasing fragmentation is already having a negative effect. While the value of global trade reached $49.5 trillion in 2022, the WTO recently lowered its trade growth forecast for 2023 from 1.7% to 0.8%, citing trade disruptions and a manufacturing slowdown.\nThe G7 must take the lead in de-escalating tensions. By ensuring that the WTO operates effectively, and by avoiding punitive measures that pose a threat to economic stability, the group could steer global trade in the right direction.\nNote: This article was originally published by\nProject Syndicate\non Oct. 19, 2023.&nbsp;\n---\nLili Yan Ing, Secretary General of the International Economic Association, is Lead Adviser for the Southeast Asian region at the Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia.\nThe views expressed in this article are those of the author.\nTags:\n#International\n#Economy\nKeywords:\nG7\nEconomic Coercion\nSHARE\nURL berhasil di salin."

    "content": "Jakarta.\nBank Indonesia (BI) is closely monitoring the potential ramifications of the Gaza conflict on the national economy, taking into account the context of a slowing global economy and rising global uncertainty.\nThe central bank's Head of Economic and Monetary Policy, Firman Muchtar, said that the global economy is set to experience a decline with a widening divergence.\n\"We initially expected the US to slow down, but it turns out their domestic demand is strengthening. Meanwhile, China, which was expected to improve with the easing of restrictions, is actually on a declining trajectory,\" Firman stated at the BNI Investor Daily Summit 2023 held in Hutan Kota by Plataran, Senayan, Jakarta, on Tuesday.\nAnother notable factor is the escalating geopolitical tension. Firman said that recent international conflicts in the Middle East have led to a spike in energy prices, compounded by the upward trend in food prices.\nAdvertisement\n\"The latest escalation in geopolitics is the conflict in the Middle East, which has driven an increase in oil and energy prices, followed by rising food prices. These two factors, along with other strategically important commodities, have had an impact on the domestic economy,\" said Firman.\nEarlier in the day, President Joko \"Jokowi\" Widodo predicted that global crude oil prices could reach $150 per barrel from the current $90 per barrel. This increase would occur if the conflict between Israel and Hamas escalates.\n\"I checked yesterday, the price of Brent oil was still at $89, but if, as I mentioned earlier, it escalates, we don't know if it can reach $150. This is what we need to be cautious about, both on the monetary and fiscal fronts,\" Jokowi said in his opening remarks at the business summit\nFurthermore, Firman said growth is expected to slow due to tight monetary policies in the United States expected to persist until the first semester of 2024.\n\"The fiscal deficit situation in the United States is expected to expand and will require more bonds, eventually leading to increased printing of the US dollar,\" he said.\nFurthermore, the fiscal situation in the US, with its growing deficits, will stimulate the issuance of more bonds. Firman observed that this will lead to an increase in the yield of the US dollar, widening the divergence further.\nFirman said he believed&nbsp;that these factors will prompt investors to start reallocating their portfolios. As a result, the escalation will not only increase the shift to safe havens like the US but also transform the nature of assets, with the majority leaning towards liquidity.\nAs a result, the phenomenon of \"cash is the king\" has emerged, causing the US dollar to strengthen globally. In practical terms, the economic downturn affects not only Indonesia but also many other countries.\nMoreover, the exchange rates in most emerging markets are predicted to strengthen significantly. This landscape is a matter of concern for BI, as it will impact Indonesia's external sector resilience.\n\"We see that the current account could become more challenging amid falling global prices. Nevertheless, as of now, BI still perceives it as being at a healthy level. What is of concern is the shifting capital inflows and changing investor risk appetite. Hence, we encourage global portfolio readjustment, including investments in Indonesia,\" Firman concluded.\nTags:\n#Economy\nKeywords:\nBNI Investor Daily Summit 2023\nIDS 2023\nSHARE\nURL berhasil di salin."

    "content": "Jakarta.\nIndonesia said Thursday that it still did not have any plans to join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP).\nThe CPTPP is a trade pact that brings together Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, and Vietnam.&nbsp;Their combined economies represent 15.6 percent of the global gross domestic product (GDP).\nThe UK is a non-founding country of the CPTPP, but it is currently in the process of acceding to the deal. China and Taiwan have already applied for CPTPP membership in 2021. South Korea has announced that it also wants in.&nbsp;\nAmidst growing exports to the respective CPTPP members, Indonesia has not shown interest in being part of the agreement.\nAdvertisement\n“As far as I know, there are no such plans [for a CPTPP membership],\" the Indonesian trade policy agency head Kasan told a virtual conference hosted by think-tank FPCI on Thursday.\nAccording to Kasan, Indonesia's exports to the CPTPP member countries have been growing at approximately 8.2 percent per year in 2018-2022.&nbsp;\n\"But the trade data that I brought up was only to respond to the question whether the mega free trade agreements [such as the CPTPP] could manage and reduce the impact of geopolitical disruption,” Kasan said.\nHe added: “Despite not being a CPTPP member, our trade performance [with the respective signatories] is significant. … But it does not mean Indonesia is planning on joining the CPTPP.\"&nbsp;\nKasan, however, did not go into details on why Indonesia still chose to be absent in the trade deal.\nThe CPTPP is expected to eliminate over 98 percent of tariffs in the free trade area. The agreement obliges countries to treat foreign and domestic suppliers equally in government procurement. Indonesia today is trying to cut down on imported goods in its public procurement, among others, to develop its domestic industry.\nTrade Ministry data shows that Indonesia's exports to the CPTPP member countries are on the rise. For instance, Indonesia’s exports to Japan surged from $17.9 billion in 2021 to $24.9 billion the following year. The bilateral trade was in Indonesia’s favor as the ASEAN country booked a $7.7 billion surplus in 2022.\nIndonesia’s exports to Canada also stood at $1.3 billion in 2022, up from $1 billion the previous year. However, Jakarta posted a $1.7 billion deficit with Ottawa in 2022. Indonesia mostly exported natural rubber, footwear, menswear, and paper to Canada that year.

MBMA hosts one of the world's largest reserves of nickel, which is a mainstay ingredient for EV batteries. MBMA data shows that its subsidiary Sulawesi Cahaya Mineral's mines hold 13.8 million tons of nickel (1.22 percent Ni content) and 1.0 million tonnes of cobalt (0.08 percent Co content). This abundance of minerals becomes the supply of raw materials for MBMA’s nickel processing plants, be it the Rotary Kiln-Electric Furnace (RCEF) that processes saprolite or the high-pressure acid leach (HPAL) that processes limonite ores.&nbsp;\nMBMA last month also inked an agreement with China-based GEM Co. Ltd. to set up the ESG New Energy Material, a joint venture for the HPAL plant with MBMA holding 55 percent of the shares, while the remaining 45 percent goes to GEM.\nGEM will construct the HPAL plant, which lies at the Indonesian Morowali Industrial Park (IMIP), in two phases and adopt a turn-key system. In the first phase, the HPAL processing plant will have a capacity of 20,000 tons of nickel in mixed hydroxide precipitate per year. Its commissioning will begin by the end of 2024. The capacity will rise to 30,000 tons per year in the second phase which is set to take place in mid-2025.\nMost of the Indonesian nickels currently go to stainless steel production. As the world tries to shift away from fossil fuel-based vehicles, the demand for nickel increases amid&nbsp;the growing development of the EV ecosystem. It is expected that EV batteries will account for 30 percent of the global nickel use by 2040. As EV demand grows, this will likely make MBMA one of the world’s top battery raw material suppliers.\nThe following are MBMA's existing and upcoming processing plants:\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\nFacility Type\nProduction Capacity\nStatus\nCahaya Smelter Indonesia (CSID)&nbsp;\nRKEF\n19,000 tons NPI/year\nIn operation\nBukit Smelter Indonesia (BSID)\nRKEF\n19,000 tons NPI/year\nIn operation\nZhao Hui Nickel\nRKEF\n50,000 tons NPI/year\nIn operation\nHuaneng Metal Industry\nConversion of high-grade nickel matte&nbsp;\n50,000 tons of nickel matte per year\nIn operation\nGEM&nbsp;\nHPAL\n30,000 tons Ni in MHP per year\n20,000 tons/year (late 2024), 30,000 tons/year (mid-2025)\nNingbo Brunpt CATL\nHPAL\n120,000 tons of NI in MHP/year\n60,000 tons/year (H2-2025)\nMBMA president director Devin Antonio Ridwan said that the corporate actions show MBMA’s commitment to becoming a sustainable and integrated battery manufacturer. MBMA also seeks to be a global supplier in the battery industry ecosystem.\n“Our commitment to sustainability, innovation, and global partnership allows us to provide battery raw materials that are high-quality and reliable to support the global transition towards clean energy,” Devin said while reaffirming the company’s commitment towards Indonesia’s mineral downstream policy.\n\"We are trying to fill and complete the nickel-based industrial tree, by diversifying processing plants, one of which is converting nickel pig iron into low-grade nickel matte products. Apart from that, we will also develop an HPAL factory which will utilize nickel limonite or low-grade nickel as raw material,\" Devin said.\nIndonesia is currently sparing no effort to build its processing industry. According to President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo, the nickel ore export ban has become a huge economic boon to the state revenue, and this will likely open up new jobs. But it does not stop there. Indonesia also seeks to become a leading battery producer.\nAccording to the US Geological Survey, Indonesia is home to the world’s largest nickel reserves, standing at 21 million metric tons. The Energy Ministry reported that Indonesia’s nickel reserves could last for 73 years for limonite ores or nickel with low nickel content that is below 1.5 percent. The 2021 US Geological Survey report also puts Indonesia as the world’s largest nickel producer.\nCountries with the largest nickel reserves in 2022.\nThus, it makes sense that Indonesia aims to become a leading player in the EV supply chain and a global battery production hub. Merdeka Group’s presence in the industry shows that an Indonesian company can compete at the global level and become one of the leading players.&nbsp;\n\"This industrial downstream strategy will strengthen the mineral commodities in the country, in line with what President Joko \"Jokowi\" Widodo envisions, in which the processing of raw materials is a must in resource-rich developing countries so they don't rely on imports of half-finished goods,\" Nafan said.\nTags:\n#Special Updates\nKeywords:\nMerdeka Copper\nMDKA\nMerdeka Copper Gold\nSHARE\nURL berhasil di salin."

    "content": "One of the current escalating issues between the two major powers, China and the US, is the global semiconductor race. It has caused divisions within the global supply chains, such as the increased reshoring of manufacturing processes.&nbsp;\nAs a result, countries globally are making readjustments and competing for a more significant role in this growing technology sector. This is just the beginning of a global race that would affect several ASEAN countries like Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam, which are currently navigating this complex semiconductor competition.\nSemiconductors serve as critical parts for several industries, including artificial intelligence (AI) applications, electric vehicles, and other advanced technologies. In terms of market dominance, the US accounted for 47 percent of the global semiconductor market in 2020, followed by South Korea (20 percent), Japan (10 percent), the EU (10 percent), and Taiwan (7 percent). (Statista, 2021)\nGlobally, the major players in terms of market revenue include Samsung, Intel, SK Hynix, Qualcomm, and Micron Technology in 2022.\nAdvertisement\nThe global semiconductor race between the US and China has escalated since October 2022 when the US announced an export control policy on artificial intelligence (AI) and semiconductor technologies to China.&nbsp;\nThrough these restrictions, the US aims to limit China’s access and ability to produce certain advanced chips. The US does not only ban China’s access to high-end AI chips, but also choke point technologies, such as AI chip design, electronic design automation software, semiconductor manufacturing equipment, and equipment components.&nbsp;\nThe new rules will not only hinder China from enhancing its capabilities in the semiconductor industry but also make China more reliant on its domestic suppliers to maintain its growth. Responding to the US export controls, Japan and the Netherlands have also implemented new rules to control semiconductor technology exports to China, citing national security reasons.\nIn retaliation, the Ministry of Commerce of China placed restrictions on the exports of key semiconductor raw materials, namely gallium and germanium, on 3 July this year.&nbsp;\nThe two materials are mainly used in the manufacture of several high-tech productions such as chips, solar panels, and electric vehicle (EV) batteries.&nbsp;\nWhile the magnitude is seen as narrower in scope than the US’ restrictions, China’s export ban on these three elements will have a bigger impact on the market and supply chains.\nAmid the ongoing global semiconductor race, ASEAN, a grouping of nations that together constitute the world’s fifth-largest economy, has the potential to play a significant role as the economic bloc offers strengths that can enhance its position in the semiconductor industry.&nbsp;\nASEAN represents a region with several advantages such as growing manufacturing capabilities, skilled workers, and supportive government policies, which can further attract investments to become a vital production hub for semiconductors.\nWhile American and Chinese exports for semiconductors globally accounted for $28.4 billion and $220 billion in 2022, respectively, the ASEAN region’s semiconductor exports accounted for more than $165.3 billion in 2022, compared to $52.3 billion in 2017.&nbsp;\nIn addition, the revenue of the ASEAN region’s semiconductors market is projected to reach $101.8 billion this year, illustrating its vast potential in this specialized supply chain.&nbsp;\nIn particular, countries such as Singapore and Malaysia are already playing a significant role in the global supply chain, accounting for 11 percent and 7 percent of the global semiconductor market share, respectively. Singapore has built up notable capabilities in wafer fabrication constituting 5 percent of global wafer capacity, whilst Malaysia is a key global player in assembly, testing, and packaging activities.\nIn 2021, ASEAN’s Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) inflows increased by 42 percent to $174 billion, after a sharp decline in 2020. FDI in electronics, including semiconductors, provided a strong investment growth to record in 2021.&nbsp;\nThe global disruption in the semiconductors supply chain led to a further expansion of ASEAN’s electronic and semiconductor operations, particularly in Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam. &nbsp;\nTrade between the bloc’s member states and the US surged from $135.1 billion to $452.2 billion. ASEAN exports to the US nearly quadrupled from $87.9 billion to $356.7 billion over the same period with its semiconductor exports increasing by around 80 percent reaching $9 billion.&nbsp;\nAt the same time, trade between ASEAN and China reached $975.3 billion in 2022, an astounding 24-fold increase from 2000. ASEAN countries’ exports to China increased by a factor of 18 during this period, from $22.2 billion to $408.1 billion with semiconductor exports in particular rising to $26.6 billion in 2022, a 176 percent increase from 2017.&nbsp;\nThus, the strengthening trade and investment relationships with both the US and China and the growing geopolitical tensions between these major powers put ASEAN countries in an advantageous situation.\nNavigating the complex US-China rivalry is a daunting challenge for ASEAN. Therefore, for ASEAN, choosing a side is not a viable option. Given that ASEAN economies are heavily interconnected with the US, Europe, China, and other East Asian markets, the bloc must maintain a neutral stance, avoid taking sides, and instead, enhance collaboration. Diverse trade and economic partnerships could enhance ASEAN’s opportunities as well as improve ASEAN’s trade and investment.\nIndeed, ASEAN needs to keep its position as a neutral ground, not only in the semiconductor industry but also in all sectors. ASEAN needs to prioritize further its investment in research and development, manufacturing capabilities, production capacities, and skills to enhance its potential for semiconductor innovation and manufacturing.&nbsp;\nHowever, for ASEAN to capture a part of the high-tech equipment and supply chain, strategic moves focused on its foundation are also important.&nbsp;\nFirst, investment in research and development, particularly AI research, could support ASEAN’s semiconductor production capability and capacity. Second, ASEAN needs to improve and streamline its regulations and standards as a region to establish clear regulatory frameworks and facilitate trade. Last, with ASEAN’s population dividend, investment in education and training programs is the key strategy for ASEAN to develop a skilled workforce to unleash ASEAN’s potential in the long-term development of the semiconductor industry in the region.\n---\nDr. Lili Yan Ing is the Secretary General of the International Economic Association (IEA) and the Lead Advisor (Southeast Asia Region) at the Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia (ERIA).&nbsp;\nMs. Ivana Markus is a Research Associate at the Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia (ERIA).\nThe views expressed in this article are those of the authors.\nTags:\n#Asean\nKeywords:\nSemiconductor Chips\nUS-China Rivalry\nAsean\nSHARE\nURL berhasil di salin."

    "content": "Jakarta.\nAn ASEAN deputy secretary-general recently tried to deal with&nbsp;the unrealistic expectations that people had for the code of conduct on the South China Sea.\nThe South China Sea, which accounts for at least a third of the global maritime trade, has Beijing and some ASEAN members claiming over parts of the strategic waterway. To prevent conflict, ASEAN and China are negotiating a code of conduct: a set of defined rules that outline how they should behave in the South China Sea.\nBoth sides have agreed to finish the negotiations within three years’ time, and more rounds of talks are expected to take place by then. They have also adopted a guideline aimed to speed up the talks.\nAccording to Robert Matheus Michael Tene, the deputy secretary-general for ASEAN's Political-Security Community, people have the \"wrong expectations\" if they believe&nbsp;the code of conduct can resolve the overlapping maritime borders or exclusive economic zones (EEZ).\nAdvertisement\nThe code of conduct is more of a non-aggression pact. In other words, it focuses on urging countries to exercise self-restraint and undertake peaceful means if conflict ever arises. The same goes for the “Declaration on Conduct”: a non-binding document that ASEAN-China had already adopted in 2002.&nbsp;\n“Maritime boundary issues [are something] that you have to negotiate bilaterally. They cannot be solved through the code of conduct,”&nbsp;Michael said at a Foreign Policy Community of Indonesia (FPCI) forum in Jakarta on Friday.\n“The declaration and code of conduct are not meant to solve the root causes of the issues in the South China Sea, which are the maritime borders and EEZs,\" he said.\nMichael Tene added: \"[The documents] are only meant to&nbsp;create the environment that is conducive for all parties to have friendly negotiations. It is meant to help prevent conflicts and manage the situation if it ever erupts.\"\nThe code of conduct also&nbsp;needs more rounds of negotiations before it could see the light of the day.\n“There are many rounds. This year, under Indonesia's [ASEAN] chairmanship, negotiations are only scheduled for the second round,” Michael Tene said.\n“Expecting us to conclude the code of conduct in 2023, in just the second round, is an unreasonable expectation,” he told the conference.\nHe added: “I’m not belittling the seriousness of the incidents that had happened in the South China Sea in the past years. Some were very serious. … But the incidents have not led to open conflicts. This shows the declaration on&nbsp;conduct --as well as the code of conduct process-- actually work.”\nBeijing and four ASEAN members -- Brunei Darussalam, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Vietnam -- hold overlapping claims in the South China Sea.&nbsp;\nChina recently introduced a new national map that expanded its territorial claims, just ahead of the 43rd ASEAN Summit in Jakarta. Other claimants, including the Philippines, immediately lodged protests against Beijing’s new map. The controversial map also came not long after Manila accused China of using a water cannon against a Philippine military supply boat in the South China Sea.&nbsp;\nJust last week, ASEAN leaders and Chinese Premier Li Qiang assembled in Jakarta for an annual summit. As expected, the South China Sea was on the agenda.&nbsp;\nThe chair’s statement on the summit wrote that some members expressed concerns over the land reclamations and serious incidents in the area, including damage to the marine environment. The members also welcomed the “positive momentum” of the code negotiations, marked by the completion of the second reading of the single draft negotiating texts, among others.\nIn 1992, ASEAN issued a declaration that called for a peaceful dispute resolution in the South China Sea. A decade later, China and ASEAN issued the Declaration on Conduct document that mandated the establishment of the code.\nRead More:&nbsp;\nLi Qiang Brings ASEAN’s Attention to Skyrocketing Trade Amid Map Controversy\nTags:\n#Asean\nKeywords:\nSouth China Sea\nCode of Conduct\nASEAN Deputy Secretary-General\nSouth China Sea Claimants\nASEAN-China Summit\n43rd ASEAN Summit\nFPCI\nRobert Matheus Michael Tene\nSHARE\nURL berhasil di salin."

    "content": "Jakarta.\nIt is a wrap for Indonesia’s 43rd ASEAN Summit, and President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo said the event had delivered great outcomes on the economic front, as the bloc and its East Asian partners struck a deal on the development of an end-to-end&nbsp;electric vehicle (EV) ecosystem.\nOver the past three days, Jakarta hosted leaders from ASEAN countries and the bloc’s dialogue partners for a string of foreign policy talks. According to Jokowi, the gathering resulted in 90 outcome documents and a number of deals with the partnering nations. This includes an EV ecosystem cooperation between ASEAN, Japan, China, and South Korea.\n“Praise be to God. We have agreed on the development of an end-to-end EV ecosystem that receives full support from China, Japan, and Korea,” Jokowi told a news conference in Jakarta on Thursday evening.\nThe ASEAN Plus Three is a cooperation mechanism between ASEAN and the said three East Asian countries. The ASEAN Plus Three Summit on Wednesday adopted a leaders’ statement on the EV Ecosystem. A copy of the document shows that the countries agreed that e-mobility was pivotal to energy transition. The partnership is expected to pave the way for ASEAN to be part of the global EV battery supply chain.\nAdvertisement\n“We, … the ASEAN Plus Three Countries, … do hereby declare to support ASEAN to play an important role in the global production of the EV industry, including the batteries to support a robust EV ecosystem,” the ASEAN Plus Three leaders’ statement reads.\nThe leaders’ statement mentioned the harmonization of&nbsp;EV-related regional regulations and standards to facilitate trade, among others.\nBy “standards”, this would include unifying electric plugs that currently differ from one country to another, according to senior diplomat Berlianto Pandapotan Hasudungan not long ago.&nbsp;\nThe document also shows that the ASEAN Plus Three partnership is not only limited to EV charging stations and product specifications but includes the components’ upcycling and disposal.

    "content": "Jakarta.\nAny economic decision made by the US President-Elect Donald Trump is set to affect Indonesia, according to a top brass at the Asian Development Bank (ADB).\nIn about five weeks from now, businessman-turned-politician Trump will regain control of the world’s largest economies. Ahead of his inauguration, Trump has threatened a trade war against China by promising massive hikes on Chinese goods entering the US market. ADB’s country director for Indonesia, Jiro Tominaga, said Thursday that Jakarta—just like the other Asian economies—would not be immune to the impact of any policy changes under Trump. Tominaga, however, refused to say the extent of its impact, saying that it would only be visible after Trump takes office.\n“We are watching closely on the discussions [on Trump]. … Any sort of policies and directions that a country like the US takes will always have some influence in countries like Indonesia,” Tominaga told reporters in Jakarta on Thursday.\n“Yes, [Trump’s return] will have an impact [on Indonesia’s growth], but what kind of impact will depend on how exactly [Trump’s] policies come out,” Tomniaga said.\nAdvertisement\nAs Trump gears up for his comeback, President Prabowo Subianto is pursuing an 8-percent growth. ADB estimates show that Indonesia is forecast to grow 5 percent in both 2024 and 2025.\nADB’s recent report wrote that US policy changes under the upcoming Trump government could affect Asia and the Pacific’s long-term growth. But as significant policy changes take time, its effects would likely materialize from 2026. The effects, however, could be sooner if the new policies enter into force earlier than expected.\nIndonesia is also already bracing for the likely flood of Chinese imports in case Trump proceeds with the tariff hikes. Deputy Trade Minister Dyah Roro Esti not long ago told reporters that Indonesia hoped to capture the opportunity from the potentially worsening US-China trade tensions. She added, “But we need to make sure that a large part of the US-bound Chinese goods do not come to Indonesia [once Trump’s tariffs are in place].”\nGovernment data shows Indonesia-US trade hit nearly $31.6 billion in January-October 2024. Indonesia enjoyed an almost $11.5 billion surplus when trading with the US during that period. On the other hand, Indonesia-China trade totaled approximately $108.9 billion so far this year as of October.

    "content": "Jakarta.\nUS President Joe Biden recently told his Indonesian counterpart Prabowo Subianto that Washington would help Jakarta get into the rich-country club Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).\nBiden’s statement came not long after Indonesia under the Prabowo government announced it sought membership in BRICS, a separate grouping that includes US’ rival China. Biden had hosted Prabowo for a state visit at the White House on Tuesday local time. The meeting resulted in a joint statement for both countries agreeing to strengthen their bilateral ties. As Indonesia seeks a seat in the China-dominated BRICS, Biden reminded Indonesia of its OECD candidacy.\n“President Biden expressed his support for Indonesia’s efforts towards an expedited accession bid to the OECD, which provides a pathway to faster and higher quality economic growth through stronger and more accountable policy,” a joint statement issued by the White House after the talks with Prabowo reads.\nAs the candidacy process gets underway, the US said it would look forward to partnering with Indonesia on having its policies align with the OECD standards and best practices.&nbsp;\nAdvertisement\n“[This includes] supporting Indonesia as it undertakes all necessary economic, governance, trade, and labor reforms,” the statement reads.\nEx-President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo spent the final years of his term pursuing an OECD membership.

    "date": "2024-11-05 15:55:00",
    "content": "Washington.\nElection Day 2024 arrived Tuesday -- with tens of millions of Americans having already cast their ballots. Those include record numbers in Georgia, North Carolina and other battleground states that could decide the winner.\nThe early turnout in Georgia, which has flipped between the Republican and Democratic nominees in the previous two presidential elections, has been so robust -- over 4 million voters -- that a top official in the secretary of state's office said the big day could look like a “ghost town” at the polls.\nAs of Monday, Associated Press tracking of advance voting nationwide showed roughly 82 million ballots already cast -- slightly more than half the total number of votes in the presidential election four years earlier. That's driven partly by Republican voters, who were casting early ballots at a higher rate than in recent previous elections after a campaign by former President Donald Trump and the Republican National Committee to counter the Democrats' longstanding advantage in the early vote.\nDespite long lines in some places and a few hiccups that are common to all elections, early in-person and mail voting proceeded without any major problems.\nAdvertisement\nThat included in the parts of western North Carolina hammered last month by Hurricane Helene. State and local election officials, benefiting from changes made by the Republican-controlled legislature, pulled off a herculean effort to ensure residents could cast their ballots as they dealt with power outages, lack of water, and washed-out roads.\nBy the time early voting in North Carolina had ended on Saturday, over 4.4 million voters -- or nearly 57 percent of all registered voters in the state -- had cast their ballots. As of Monday, turnout in the 25 western counties affected by the hurricane was even stronger at 59 percent of registered voters, state election board Executive Director Karen Brinson Bell said.\nPeople stand in line during the last day of early voting, Saturday, Nov. 2, 2024, in Charlotte, North Carolina. (AP Photo/Mike Stewart)\nBrinson Bell called the voters and election workers in the hurricane-hit counties \"an inspiration to us all.”\nBesides the hurricanes in North Carolina and Florida, the most worrisome disruptions to the election season so far were arson attacks that damaged ballots in two drop boxes near the Oregon-Washington border. Authorities there were searching for the person responsible.\nThe absence of any significant, widespread problems has not stopped Trump, the Republican nominee, or the RNC, which is now under his sway, from making numerous claims of fraud or election interference during the early voting period, a possible prelude to challenges after Election Day.\nHe has mischaracterized an investigation underway in Pennsylvania into roughly 2,500 potentially fraudulent voter registration applications by saying one of the counties was “caught with 2600 Fake Ballots and Forms, all written by the same person.” The investigation is into registration applications; there is no indication that ballots are involved.\nIn Georgia, Republicans sought to prohibit voters from returning mailed ballots to their local election office by the close of polls on Election Day, votes that are allowed under state law. A judge rejected their lawsuit over the weekend.\nTrump and Republicans also have warned about the possibility that Democrats are recruiting masses of noncitizens to vote, a claim they have made without evidence and that runs counter to the data, including from Republican secretaries of state. Research has consistently shown that noncitizens registering to vote is rare. Any noncitizen who does faces the potential of felony charges and deportation, a significant disincentive.\nOne case of noncitizen voting was caught during early voting last month and resulted in felony charges in Michigan after a student from China cast an illegal early ballot.\nThis is the first presidential vote since Trump lost to Joe Biden four years ago and began various attempts to circumvent the outcome and remain in power. That climaxed with the violent Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol to halt certification of the results after Trump told his supporters to “fight like hell.”\nEven now, a solid majority of Republicans believe Trump's lie that Biden was not legitimately elected, despite reviews, audits and recounts in the battleground states that all affirmed Biden's win. A survey last month from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research showed Republicans remain much more skeptical than Democrats that their ballots will be counted accurately this year.\nSeeking to rebuild voter confidence in a system targeted with false claims of widespread fraud, Republican lawmakers in more than a dozen states since 2020 have passed new voting restrictions. Those rules include shortening the window to apply or return a mail ballot, reducing the availability of ballot drop boxes and adding ID requirements.\nOn the last weekend before Election Day, Trump continued to falsely claim the election was being rigged against him and said a presidential winner should be declared on election night, before all the ballots are counted.\nVice President Kamala Harris urged voters not to fall for Trump’s tactic of casting doubt on elections. The Democratic nominee told supporters at a weekend rally in Michigan that the tactic was intended to suggest to people “that if they vote, their vote won’t matter.” Instead, she urged people who had already cast ballots to encourage their friends to do the same.\nThrough four years of election lies and voting-related conspiracy theories, local election officials have faced harassment and even death threats. That has prompted high turnover and led to heightened security for election offices and polling sites that includes panic buttons and bullet-proof glass.\nWhile there have been no major reports of any malicious cyberactivity affecting election offices, foreign actors have been active in using fake social media profiles and websites to drum up partisan vitriol and disinformation. In the final weeks, US intelligence officials have attributed to Russia multiple fake videos alleging election fraud in presidential swing states.\nA voter fills out his ballot during early voting in the general election, Friday, Nov. 1, 2024, in Fall River, Massachusetts. (AP Photo/Steven Senne)\nOn the eve of Election Day, they issued a joint statement with federal law enforcement agencies warning that Russia in particular was ramping up its influence operations, including in ways that could incite violence, and likely would continue those efforts well after the votes have been cast.\nJen Easterly, the nation’s top election security official, urged Americans to rely on state and local election officials for information about elections.\n“This is especially important as we are in an election cycle with an unprecedented amount of disinformation, including disinformation being aggressively peddled and amplified by our foreign adversaries at a greater scale than ever before,” she said. “We cannot allow our foreign adversaries to have a vote in our democracy.”\nTags:\n#International\nKeywords:\nUS presidential election\nDonald Trump v Kamala Harris\nDonald Trump\nKamala Harris\nElection Day\nSHARE\nURL berhasil di salin."

They spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss a matter that has not been publicly disclosed.\nThe White House declined to confirm the weapons transfer but reiterated its concern that Iran is deepening its support of Russia. The White House has been warning Iran for months not to transfer ballistic missiles to Russia.\n\"Any transfer of Iranian ballistic missiles to Russia would represent a dramatic escalation in Iran’s support for Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine and lead to the killing of more Ukrainian civilians,\" National Security Council spokesman Sean Savett said in a statement. \"This partnership threatens European security and illustrates how Iran’s destabilizing influence reaches beyond the Middle East and around the world.”\nAdvertisement\nThe US finding comes as the Kremlin tries to repel Ukraine's surprise offensive that has led to the seizure of about 500 square miles (1,300 kilometers) of Russia’s Kursk region. Meanwhile, Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelensky, is pressing allies to allow his country to use Western-supplied missiles to strike deep inside Russia and hit sites from which Moscow launches aerial attacks.\nIran, as it has with previous US intelligence findings, denied providing Russia with weapons for its war in Ukraine.\n“Iran considers the provision of military assistance to the parties engaged in the conflict -- which leads to increased human casualties, destruction of infrastructure, and a distancing from ceasefire negotiations -- to be inhumane,” according to a statement from Iran's mission to the United Nations. \"Thus, not only does Iran abstain from engaging in such actions itself, but it also calls upon other countries to cease the supply of weapons to the sides involved in the conflict.”\nCIA Director William Burns, who was in London on Saturday for a joint appearance with his British intelligence counterpart, warned of the growing and “troubling” defense relationship involving Russia, China, Iran and North Korea that he said threatens both Ukraine and Western allies in the Middle East.\nThe White House has repeatedly declassified and publicized intelligence findings that show North Korea has sent ammunition and missiles to Russia to use against Ukraine, while Iran supplies Moscow with attack drones and has assisted the Kremlin with building a drone-manufacturing factory.\nChina has held back from providing Russians with weaponry but has surged sales to Russia of machine tools, microelectronics and other technology that Moscow in turn is using to produce missiles, tanks, aircraft and other weaponry, according to US officials.\nThe White House has been on edge for months about a possible deal between Iran and Russia.\nThe Democratic administration said in January that US intelligence officials had determined a Russian-Iran deal had not been completed, but officials were concerned that Russia’s negotiations to acquire missiles from Iran were actively advancing.\nLast September, according to the White House, Iran hosted a top Russian defense official to show off a range of ballistic missile systems, adding to the US concern that a deal could come together.\nThe US and other countries have taken steps aimed at thwarting the supply, sale or transfer involving Iran and ballistic missile-related items, including issuing guidance to private companies about Iranian missile procurement practices to make sure those companies are not inadvertently supporting Iran’s development efforts.\nPresident Joe Biden is set to host British Prime Minister Keir Starmer for talks at the White House on Friday. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said “continuing robust support to Ukraine in its defense against Russian aggression” will be on their agenda.\nTags:\n#International\nKeywords:\nIran Ballistic Missile\nRussia-Ukraine War\nVolodymyr Zelensky\nSHARE\nURL berhasil di salin."

    "content": "Vatican City.\nIf any evidence were needed to underscore that Pope Francis’ upcoming trip to Asia and Oceania is the longest, farthest and most challenging of his pontificate, it’s that he’s bringing along his secretaries to help him navigate the four-country program while keeping up with work back home.\nFrancis will clock 32,814 kilometers (20,390 miles) by air during his Sept. 2-13 visit to Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, East Timor and Singapore, far surpassing any of his previous 44 foreign trips and notching one of the longest papal trips ever, both in terms of days on the road and distances traveled.\nThat’s no small feat for a pope who turns 88 in December, uses a wheelchair, lost part of a lung to a respiratory infection as a young man and had to cancel his last foreign trip at the last minute (to Dubai in November to participate in the UN climate conference) on doctors' orders.\nBut Francis is pushing ahead with this trip, originally planned for 2020 but postponed because of Covid-19. He’s bringing along his medical team of a doctor and two nurses and taking the usual health precautions on the ground. But in a novelty, he's adding his personal secretaries into the traditional Vatican delegation of cardinals, bishops and security.\nAdvertisement\nThe long trip recalls the globetrotting travels of St. John Paul II, who visited all four destinations during his quarter-century pontificate, though East Timor was an occupied part of Indonesia at the time of his landmark 1989 trip.\nBy retracing John Paul’s steps, Francis is reinforcing the importance that Asia has for the Catholic Church since it’s one of the few places where the church is growing in terms of baptized faithful and religious vocations. And he is highlighting that the complex region also embodies some of his core priorities as pope -- an emphasis on interreligious and intercultural dialogue, care for the environment and insistence on the spiritual component of economic development.\nHere is a look at the trip and some of the issues that are likely to come up, with the Vatican’s relations with China ever-present in the background in a region where Beijing wields enormous influence.\nIndonesia\nFrancis loves gestures of interfaith fraternity and harmony, and there could be no better symbol of religious tolerance at the start of his trip than the underground “Tunnel of Friendship” linking Indonesia’s main Istiqlal mosque to the country’s Catholic cathedral.\nFrancis will visit the underpass in central Jakarta with the grand imam, Nasaruddin Umar, before both partake in an interfaith gathering and sign a joint declaration.\nFrancis has made improving Christian-Muslim relations a priority, and has often used his foreign travels to promote his agenda of committing religious leaders to work for peace and tolerance, and renounce violence in God’s name.\nIndonesia is home to the world’s largest Muslim population and has enshrined religious freedom in its constitution, officially recognizing six religions -- Islam, Buddhism, Confucianism, Hinduism, Protestantism and Catholicism. Francis is likely to highlight this tradition of religious tolerance and celebrate it as a message for the broader world.\n“If we are able to create a kind of collaboration between each other, that could be a great strength of the Indonesian nation,” the imam said in an interview.\nPapua New Guinea\nFrancis was elected pope in 2013 largely on the strength of an extemporaneous speech he delivered to his fellow cardinals in which he said the Catholic Church needed to go to the “peripheries” to reach those who need God’s comfort the most. When Francis travels deep into the jungles of Papua New Guinea, he will be fulfilling one of the marching orders he set out for the future pope on the eve of his own election.\nFew places are as remote, peripheral and poverty-wracked as Vanimo, a northern coastal town on the main island of New Guinea. There Francis will meet with missionaries from his native Argentina who are working to bring Christianity to a largely tribal people who still practice pagan traditions alongside the Catholic faith.\n“If we suspend our preconceptions, even in tribal cultures we can find human values close to Christian ideals,” Cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle, who heads the Vatican’s missionary evangelization office and is part of the Vatican delegation, told the Fides missionary news agency.\nFrancis will likely reflect on the environmental threats to vulnerable and poor places like Papua New Guinea, such as deep sea mining and climate change, while also pointing to the diversity of its estimated 10 million people who speak some 800 languages but are prone to tribal conflicts.\nEast Timor\nWhen John Paul visited East Timor in 1989, he sought to console its overwhelmingly Catholic population who had suffered under Indonesia's occupation for 15 years already.\n“For many years now, you have experienced destruction and death as a result of conflict; You have known what it means to be the victims of hatred and struggle,” John Paul told the faithful during a seaside Mass in Tasi-Toli, near Dili.\n“I pray that those who have responsibility for life in East Timor will act with wisdom and good will towards all, as they search for a just and peaceful resolution of present difficulties,” he said then in a direct challenge to Indonesia.\nFrancis will literally walk in John Paul’s footsteps when he celebrates Mass on the same seaside esplanade as that 1989 liturgy, which some see as a key date in the Timorese independence movement.\nThis Oct. 12, 1989 file photo shows Pope John Paul II shaking hands with flag-waving local students upon his arrival in Dili, East Timor. (AP Photo/Bullit Marquez)\n“That Mass with the pope was a very strong, very important moment for Timor’s identity,” said Giorgio Bernardelli, editor of AsiaNews, the missionary news agency. “It also in many ways put the spotlight on the drama that Timor was living for the international community.”\nAnother legacy that will confront Francis is that of the clergy sexual abuse scandal: Revered independence hero and Nobel Peace Prize winner Bishop Carlos Felipe Ximenes Belo was secretly sanctioned by the Vatican in 2020 for sexually abusing young boys.\nThere is no word on whether Francis will refer to Belo, who is still revered in East Timor but has been barred by the Vatican from ever returning.\nSingapore\nFrancis has used several of his foreign trips to send messages to China, be they direct telegrams of greetings when he flies through Chinese airspace or more indirect gestures of esteem, friendship and fraternity to the Chinese people when nearby.\nFrancis’ visit to Singapore, where three-quarters of the population is ethnically Chinese and Mandarin is an official language, will give him yet another opportunity to reach out to Beijing as the Vatican seeks improved ties for the sake of China's estimated 12 million Catholics.\n“It’s a faithful people, who lived through a lot and remained faithful,” Francis told the Chinese province of his Jesuit order in a recent interview.\nThe trip comes a month before the Vatican is set to renew a landmark 2018 agreement governing bishop nominations.\nJust last week, the Vatican reported its “satisfaction” that China had officially recognized Tianjin Bishop Melchior Shi Hongzhen, who as far as the Vatican is concerned had actually taken over as bishop in 2019. The Holy See said China’s official recognition of him under civil law now was “a positive fruit of the dialogue established over the years between the Holy See and the Chinese government.”\nBut by arriving in Singapore, a regional economic powerhouse which maintains good relations with both China and the United States, Francis is also stepping into a protracted maritime dispute as China has grown increasingly assertive with its presence in the South China Sea.\nTags:\n#Religion\nKeywords:\nPope Francis\nPope Francis Visits Indonesia\nPope Francis Visit\nPope John Paul II\nSHARE\nURL berhasil di salin."

    "content": "Jakarta\n. The&nbsp;failed assassination attempt on former US President Donald Trump has caused uncertainties in financial markets, including Indonesia. Analysts predict government bond yields to rise, while equity investors may become more cautious.\n\"This incident could boost Trump's popularity and increase his chances of winning the upcoming election,\" said Pasardana co-founder Hans Kwee on Sunday.\nKwee noted that financial markets generally do not favor a Trump victory in the presidential election. His aggressive trade policies could disrupt the economy, and his strong pro-Israel stance might escalate tensions in the Middle East, leading to higher oil prices and inflation. However, Trump’s support for Russia could potentially end the Russia-Ukraine war, lowering Russian gas prices in Europe and reducing coal prices.\nOn the impact of the Trump shooting on the Indonesian stock market, Kwee emphasized that this sentiment needs to be monitored further to determine if it will have a long-term effect. \"If it has a long-term impact, meaning Trump’s popularity continues to rise, the market might start to correct. However, in the short term, people will be more cautious, and corrections are very likely,\" he said.\nAdvertisement\nKwee is confident that the Trump incident will not affect the Federal Reserve's decision on the interest rate. \"US inflation data was quite low, with unemployment at 4.1 percent, so the Federal Reserve is likely to cut by 25 basis points in September. Especially with the US&nbsp;election in November, there is a high chance of a rate cut then,\" he added.\nMeanwhile, government bond yields (SUN) are expected to increase to 6.8 percent-7.2 percent&nbsp;for 10-year tenors this week,&nbsp;slightly higher than the previous week's close of 6.944 percent, according to Pefindo Fixed Income Analyst Ahmad Nasrudin.\n\"I expect the bond market to be under pressure due to increasing negative external sentiment. Geopolitical risks, such as the Trump shooting and rising tensions in Taiwan, will influence the market,\" explained Ahmad on Monday.\nTokyo’s latest defense white paper warns of increasing risks from China, North Korea, and Russia. \"Foreign investors tend to be more cautious and speculative in emerging markets, including Indonesia,\" Ahmad added.\nMarkets are also awaiting speeches from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on the direction of US&nbsp;monetary policy and the European Central Bank (ECB) meeting.\nIn Asia, attention is on the third plenary session of the Chinese Communist Party and potential major fiscal policy reforms. China's economic growth is expected to slow, and policies related to the medium-term lending facility from the People’s Bank of China will be closely watched.\n\"Geopolitical sentiment and economic data will influence the performance of domestic bond markets this week. I expect yields to move slightly upwards, assuming stronger geopolitical sentiment than positive economic data releases,\" he said.\nWorld shares began the week trading mixed and US&nbsp;futures were higher after the shooting incident.&nbsp;\nMarkets seemed to take in stride the shooting at&nbsp;Trump’s rally in Butler, Pennsylvania&nbsp;that is being investigated as an&nbsp;attempted assassination&nbsp;of the presumptive Republican nominee.\nShares in Trump Media &amp; Technology Group Corp. jumped sharply in pre-market trading Monday, gaining as much as 70 percent. They were up 52 percent&nbsp;at $46.92 a share on the Nasdaq as of 6 a.m. local time in New York.\nGermany’s DAX edged 0.1 percent&nbsp;lower to 18,721.84 and the CAC 40 in Paris declined 0.4&nbsp;percent to 7,697.04.

    "content": "Jakarta.\nInvestment Minister Bahlil Lahadalia recently denied claims of China having a monopoly on foreign investments in Indonesia.\nGovernment data showed that China has consistently been among Indonesia’s top foreign investors. Chinese participation in many of the country’s major projects sparked concerns if Beijing’s influence had been growing too strong. According to Bahlil, Indonesia has been inclusive in the foreign direct investment (FDI) that they accepted into the country\n“Speaking of which countries are investing in Indonesia, all this time, people have been saying that it [our foreign investor] has always been China, China, China, and China. And we see these statements in Whatsapp groups which have the most hoaxes,” Bahlil told a conference at Jatinangor’s Public Administration Institute on Thursday.\n“It is not true that [our foreign investments] are being monopolized by a certain country,” Bahlil said.\nAdvertisement\nSingapore remained unmoved from the first spot of Indonesia's foreign investor rankings over the past five years, with Singaporean FDI totaling $15.4 billion in 2023. Indonesia drew $4.2 billion in Singaporean investments in the first quarter of 2024. But again, Bahlil claimed that a large part of the Singaporean investments belonged to Indonesian entrepreneurs who had put their money in the close neighbor. Many Indonesian businessmen had been treating Singapore as a financial hub.\nChina and Hong Kong have consistently been fighting for the second spot. China claimed the second position in 2023 as Chinese investments totaled $7.4 billion. Followed by Hong Kong at $6.5 billion. Hong Kong, however, beat China in the first quarter of 2024 by around $20,000 lead.\nIndonesia is also attracting investments from other countries as well.\nEuropean countries had been struggling to enter Indonesia’s top 10 FDI source countries. But the Netherlands secured the 8th place in 2022 and 2023, investing around $1.2 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively. Swiss cracked the top 10 in 2021, during which it invested around $590 million, according to Bahlil.&nbsp;\nThe US --whose ties with China have soured-- has also been maintaining its position in the top 10, placing 6th ($3.3 billion) in the 2023 ranking. Washington even rose to the 4th place in the Q1-2024 data, as American investments totaled $1.1 billion.\n“We are very inclusive to all investors. We are not putting one country first. Anyone can invest here as long as they comply with the existing regulations in Indonesia,” Bahlil said.\nIndonesia attracted Rp 401.5 trillion (around $24.9 billion) in combined domestic and foreign investments in the first three months of 2024. This is equivalent to 24.3 percent of what Indonesia targeted for the year, which amounted to Rp 1,650 trillion.&nbsp;\nTags:\n#Economy\nKeywords:\nChinese Investment in Indonesia\nFDI Source\nforeign direct investment\nBahlil Lahadalia\nInvestment Minister\nSHARE\nURL berhasil di salin."

    "content": "Rome.\nPope Francis will preside over an interfaith meeting in a mosque in the world’s largest predominantly Muslim country during a four-nation Asian visit in September that will be the longest and most complicated foreign trip of his pontificate.\nThe Vatican on Friday released the itinerary for Francis’ Sept. 2-13 trip to Indonesia, East Timor, Papua New Guinea and Singapore. The packed schedule makes clear that the 87-year-old pontiff, who has battled health problems and is increasingly reliant on a wheelchair, has no plans to slow down.\nAfter a day of rest upon arrival in Jakarta on Sept. 3, Francis launches into a typically rigorous round of protocol visits to heads of state and government, speeches to diplomats and meetings with clergy and public Masses.\nFrancis will be the third pope to visit Indonesia, after Pope Paul VI in 1970 and Pope John Paul II in 1989. About 87 percent of Indonesia’s 277 million people are Muslim, but the country also has Southeast Asia’s second-largest Christian population, after the Philippines, and the third-largest in Asia after the Philippines and China.\nAdvertisement\nIn Jakarta, he’ll preside over an interfaith meeting at the capital’s Istiqlal Mosque, expected to be attended by leaders of the six religions in Indonesia that are officially recognized and protected: Islam, Protestant, Catholic, Buddhism, Hinduism and Confucianism.\nFrancis is also expected to walk through a tunnel, called the “Tunnel of Friendship,” connecting the grand mosque to the neo-Gothic Our Lady of The Assumption Cathedral, which was constructed by Indonesian authorities in 2020.\nAs a result, the first leg of Francis' four-nation trip is likely to heavily emphasize interreligious harmony and tolerance, a theme he has hammered home on many of his foreign visits, especially to the Gulf and other Muslim-majority nations.\nSprinkled in the mix in all four countries are encounters with young people, poor and disabled people, elderly people and Francis’ regular meetings with his Jesuit confreres.\nThe trip was originally planned for 2020 but was called off because of the COVID-19 pandemic. At 11 full days, it's the longest of Francis’ 11-year papacy, outpacing by a few days some of his long trips to the Americas and recalling some of the strenuous, globe-hopping trips of St. John Paul II.\nIt will bring the Argentine Jesuit to Indonesia, as well as one of the world's newest countries, the former Portuguese colony of East Timor, where the Catholic Church wields enormous influence.\nAbout 98.3 percent of its 1.34 million population is Catholic, according to the 2022 census, and it’s the Asian country with the highest proportion of Catholics after the Philippines.\nFrancis will be the second pope to visit East Timor after John Paul in 1989, but the first since the country gained independence from Indonesia in 2002.\nIn East Timor, however, Francis may also have to reckon with the legacy of independence hero Bishop Carlos Ximenes Belo. The Nobel Peace Prize winner was sanctioned by the Vatican in 2020 for having sexually abused young Timorese boys and is currently believed to be living in Portugal.\nFrancis had to cancel his last planned foreign visit -- a quick trip to Dubai last year to participate in the UN climate conference -- because of a recurring case of bronchitis. He has seemed in relatively good form in recent months, including during day trips to Italian cities and visits to Roman parishes.\nBut in recent years, as his mobility has been limited by bad knee ligaments, he has generally stuck closer to home and kept his foreign trips relatively short.\nAfter he returns to Rome in mid-September, he has a four-day visit to Belgium and Luxembourg before the end of the month, the only other foreign trip that has been confirmed for the year.\nTags:\n#Religion\nKeywords:\nPope Francis\nPope Francis Visit\nIstiqlal Mosque\nReligious tolerance\nInterfaith Meeting\nSHARE\nURL berhasil di salin."

    "content": "Obbürgen, Switzerland.\nEighty countries jointly called Sunday for the “territorial integrity” of Ukraine to be the basis for any peace agreement to end Russia’s two-year war, though some key developing nations at a Swiss conference did not join in.\nThe joint communique capped a two-day conference at the Bürgenstock resort in Switzerland marked by the absence of Russia, which was not invited, but that many attendees hoped could join in on a roadmap to peace some time in the future.\nThe all-out war since President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 has killed or injured hundreds of thousands of people, unsettled world markets for goods like grain and fertilizer, driven millions from their homes and carved a wedge between the West -- which has sanctioned Moscow over the war -- and Russia, China and some other countries.\nAbout 100 delegations, mostly Western countries but also some key developing nations, were on hand for the conference that was billed as a first step toward peace at a time when the warring countries are seemingly as far apart as ever.\nAdvertisement\nThe event included presidents and prime ministers from France, Germany, Britain, Japan, Poland, Argentina, Ecuador, Kenya and Somalia.\nIndia, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Thailand and the United Arab Emirates -- which were represented by foreign ministers or lower-level envoys -- were among those that did not sign the final document, which focused on issues of nuclear safety, food security and the exchange of prisoners.\nBrazil, an “observer” country, did not sign on but Turkey -- which has at times sought to act an intermediary between Russia and Ukraine -- did.\nThe final document said the UN Charter and “respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty … can and will serve as a basis for achieving a comprehensive, just and lasting peace in Ukraine.”\nViola Amherd, the Swiss president who hosted the event, told the final news conference the “great majority” of participants agreed to the final document, which “shows what diplomacy can achieve.\"\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky hailed the “first steps toward peace” at the meeting, and said the joint communique remains “open for accession by everyone who respects the UN Charter.”\nTestifying to both war fatigue and other preoccupations that have emerged in recent months, only about half UN member countries took part. In March 2022, condemnation of Russia’s invasion led to passage of a non-binding resolution at the UN General Assembly by 141 countries calling for a halt to Moscow’s use of force and pullout of Russian troops.\nIn Switzerland, the challenge was to talk tough about Russia, but also open the door for it to join a peace initiative.\n“Many countries ... wanted the involvement of representatives of the Russian Federation,” Zelensky told a final news conference. “At the same time, the majority of the countries do not want to shake hands with them (Russian leaders) ... so there are various opinions in the world.”\nUrsula von der Leyen, the president of the European Union’s executive Commission, said the conference was rightly entitled “Path to Peace” because peace won’t be achieved in a single step.\n“It was not a peace negotiation because Putin is not serious about ending the war. He is insisting on capitulation. He is insisting on ceding Ukrainian territory -- even territory that today is not occupied by him,” she said. “He is insisting on disarming Ukraine, leaving it vulnerable to future aggression. No country would ever accept these outrageous terms.”\nAnalysts suspected the two-day conference would have little concrete impact toward ending the war because Russia, was not invited. China, which did not attend, and Brazil have jointly sought to plot alternative routes toward peace.\nThe themes of nuclear safety, food security and prisoner exchanges featured in the final statement. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said they amounted to “minimum conditions” for negotiations with Russia, alluding to how many other areas of disagreement between Kyiv and Moscow will be harder to overcome.\nQatar's prime minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, said Saturday that his rich Gulf country hosted talks with both Ukrainian and Russian delegations on the reunification of Ukrainian children with their families that has so far resulted in 34 children being reunited.\nThe Ukrainian government believes that 19,546 children have been deported or forcibly displaced, and Russian Children’s Rights Commissioner Maria Lvova-Belova has previously confirmed that at least 2,000 were taken from Ukrainian orphanages.\nMontenegro Prime Minister Milojko Spajic told the gathering Sunday: “As a father of three, I'm deeply concerned by thousands of Ukrainian kids forcibly transferred to Russia or Russia-occupied territories of Ukraine.”\n“We all at this table need to do more so that children of Ukraine are back in Ukraine,” he added.\nIn Kyiv, at a regular demonstration by relatives of soldiers captured by Russia, the response to the Swiss gathering was muted.\n“I would really like to believe that this (conference) will have an impact, but some very important countries did not sign the communique,” said Yana Shyrokyh, 56, whose army serviceman son has been in captivity since 2022. “I would really like them to find powerful levers of influence on Russia.\"\nTags:\n#International\nKeywords:\nRussia-Ukraine War\nVolodymyr Zelensky\nVladimir Putin\nSHARE\nURL berhasil di salin."

    "content": "Beijing.\nRussian President Vladimir Putin thanked Chinese leader Xi Jinping for his effort to resolve the Ukraine conflict at a Beijing summit Thursday, where the two leaders reaffirmed a “no-limits” partnership that has grown deeper as both countries face deepening tensions with the west.\nPutin’s two-day state visit to one of his strongest allies comes as his country’s forces are pressing an offensive in northeastern Ukraine’s Kharkiv region in the most significant border incursion since the full-scale invasion began.\nWhile both leaders said they were seeking an end to the war in Ukraine, they offered no new specifics in their public remarks Thursday afternoon. China has significant influence as a key supporter of Russia its invasion.\nThe country claims to take a neutral position in the conflict, but it has backed Moscow’s contentions that Russia was provoked into attacking Ukraine by the West, and continues to supply Russia with key components that Moscow needs for its production of weapons.\nAdvertisement\nChina proposed a broadly worded peace plan in 2023, but it was rejected by both Ukraine and the West for failing to call for Russia to leave occupied parts of Ukraine.\n“China hopes for the early return of Europe to peace and stability and will continue to play a constructive role toward this,” Xi said, speaking alongside Putin.\nHis words were an echo of what China said last year when it first offered a broad plan for peace outlining general principles for ending the war in Ukraine.\nPutin said he will inform the Chinese leader in detail about “the situation in Ukraine,” and said “we appreciate the initiative of our Chinese colleagues and friends to regulate the situation.” He added that the two planned to engage in further foreign policy discussions at an informal meeting later Thursday.\nChinese President Xi Jinping, right, and Russian President Vladimir Putin attend an official welcome ceremony in Beijing, China, on Thursday, May 16, 2024. (Sergei Bobylev, Sputnik, Kremlin Pool Photo via AP)\nAfter Russia’s newest offensive in Ukraine last week, the 2-year-old war has entered a critical stage, as Ukraine’s depleted military waits for new supplies of anti-aircraft missiles and artillery shells from the United States after months of delay.\nBefore their remarks, the two leaders signed a joint statement on deepening the comprehensive strategic partnership between their two nations on their 75th anniversary of diplomatic ties, after their initial meeting. Xi said China and Russia will continue to uphold a position of non-alliance and non-confrontation.\nThursday’s meeting was yet another affirmation of the friendly “no limits” relationship they signed in 2022, just before Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\nSince then, Russia has become increasingly economically dependent on China as Western sanctions cut its access to much of the international trading system. China’s increased trade with Russia, totaling $240 billion last year, has helped the country mitigate some of the worst blowback from sanctions.\nMoscow has diverted the bulk of its energy exports to China and relied on Chinese companies to import high-tech components for Russian military industries to circumvent Western sanctions.\n“I and President Putin agree, we should actively look for convergence points of the interests of both countries, to develop each’s advantages, and deepen integration of interests, realizing each others’ achievements,” Xi said.\nIn their meeting, Xi congratulated Putin on his election to a fifth term in office and celebrated the 75th anniversary of diplomatic relations forged between the former Soviet Union and the People’s Republic of China, which was established following a civil war in 1949. Putin faced no credible opposition in the presidential race, and, like Xi, has not laid out any plans for any potential successors.\nOn the eve of the visit, Putin said in an interview with Chinese media that the Kremlin is prepared to negotiate over the conflict in Ukraine. “We are open to a dialogue on Ukraine, but such negotiations must take into account the interests of all countries involved in the conflict, including ours,” Putin was quoted as saying by the official Xinhua News Agency.\nPutin said a Chinese proposal made in 2023, which Ukraine and the West rejected, could “lay the groundwork for a political and diplomatic process that would take into account Russia’s security concerns and contribute to achieving a long-term and sustainable peace.”\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said any negotiations must include a restoration of Ukraine’s territorial integrity, the withdrawal of Russian troops, the release of all prisoners, a tribunal for those responsible for the aggression and security guarantees for Ukraine.\nPutin has blamed the West for the failure of negotiations in the opening weeks of the war and praised China’s peace plan.\nRussia-China military ties have also strengthened during the war in Ukraine. They have held a series of joint war games in recent years, including naval drills and patrols by long-range bombers over the Sea of Japan and the East China Sea. Russian and Chinese ground forces also have deployed to the other country’s territory for joint drills.\nChina remains a major market for Russian military, while also massively expanding its domestic defensive industries, including building aircraft carriers and nuclear submarines.\nPutin has previously said that Russia has been sharing highly sensitive military technologies with China that helped significantly bolster its defense capability. In October 2019, he mentioned that Russia was helping China to develop an early warning system to spot ballistic missile launches -- a system involving ground-based radar and satellites that only Russia and the US possessed.\nTags:\n#International\nKeywords:\nVladimir Putin\nXi Jinping\nRussia-China relations\nRussia-Ukraine War\nPutin Visits China\nSHARE\nURL berhasil di salin."

    "content": "Beijing.\nThe death toll climbed to 48 as search efforts continued in southern China on Thursday after a highway section collapsed in a mountainous area, sending more than 20 cars down a steep slope.\nOfficials in the city of Meizhou said three other people were unidentified, pending DNA testing. It wasn’t immediately clear if they had died, which would bring the death toll to 51.\nThe section collapsed after heavy rains and the Meizhou city government said that 23 vehicles have been found after a 17.9-meter (58.7-foot) long section of the highway gave way about 2 a.m. on Wednesday. Thirty other people had injuries, none of them life-threatening, a government statement said.\nThe search effort was complicated by steady rain, gravel and soil coming down at the site, posing some risk to the workers, a fire department official told Chinese media.\nAdvertisement\nRescue teams divided the area into 10 grids and searched with dogs and life-detecting devices, the report said. Excavators and cranes were also brought in to help.\nThe collapse left a barren scar down a steep slope in an otherwise verdant green forested area. Witnesses told local media they heard a loud noise and saw a wide hole open up behind them after driving past the section just before it collapsed.\nVideo and photos in local media showed smoke and fire at the scene, with a highway guardrail leaning down into the flames. A pile of blackened cars could be seen on the slope leading down from the highway.\nA photo later showed a construction crane lowering a mangled car to the road surface, near three other similarly wrecked vehicles. All appeared to have been burned out.\nOver 56 centimeters (22 inches) of rain has fallen in the past four weeks in the county where the roadway collapsed, more than four times as much as last year. Some villages in Meizhou flooded in early April, and the city had seen heavy rain in recent days.\nParts of Guangdong province have seen record rains and flooding in the past two weeks, as well as hail. A tornado killed five people in Guangzhou, the provincial capital, last weekend.\nHeavy rain and flooding pose a special risk to mountain roadways and highway bridges because of erosion, debris flows and landslides. China has massively expanded its infrastructure in recent years, adding more than 1 million highway bridges, the world's largest network of high-speed trains and scores of new airports.\nIn the rush to build, flaws in design and construction methods have frequently come to light, while regular inspections and maintenance are sometimes given short shrift. Dozens have died in recent years in tunnel collapses and floods, including 14 who drowned in subway trains in the central city of Zhenzhou during massive flooding that killed around 300 people.\nSubsequent reports said the system had not been prevented with adequate and other equipment and that officials failed to suspend service as they should have under government directives.\nChina's overseas projects such as roads and dams under the Belt and Road Initiative have also been criticized for design problems and poor quality, potentially posing a challenge to its efforts to build its influence in the developing world.\nTags:\n#International\nKeywords:\nHighway Collapse\nGuangdong Province\nRoad Disaster\nMeizhou\nInfrastructure Failure\nSHARE\nURL berhasil di salin."

    "content": "London.\nTikTok is in the crosshairs of authorities in the US, where new legislation threatens a nationwide ban unless its China-based parent ByteDance divests. It would be the biggest blow yet to the popular video-sharing app, which has faced various restrictions around the world.\nTikTok is already banned in a handful of countries and from government-issued devices in a number of others, due to official worries that the app poses privacy and cybersecurity concerns.\nThose fears are reflected in the US bill, which is the culmination of long-held bipartisan fears in Washington that China’s communist leaders could force ByteDance to hand over US user data, or influence Americans by suppressing or promoting certain content. TikTok has long maintained that it doesn’t share data with the Chinese government and its CEO has taken a defiant stance, vowing to fight back.\nHere are the places that have partial or total bans on TikTok:\nAdvertisement\nAfghanistan\nTikTok has been banned since 2022, along with videogame PUBG, after the country's Taliban leadership decided to forbid access on the grounds of protecting young people from “being misled.”\nAustralia\nTikTok is not allowed on devices issued by the Australian federal government. Attorney-General Mark Dreyfus said he made the decision after getting advice from the country’s intelligence and security agencies.\nBelgium\nThe National Security Council decided last month to indefinitely ban TikTok from devices owned or paid for by the federal government. The ban was issued on a temporary basis last year on worries about cybersecurity, privacy and misinformation. Prime Minister Alexander de Croo said it was based on warnings from the country’s state security service and cybersecurity center.\nCanada\nDevices issued by the federal government are forbidden from using TikTok. Officials cited an “unacceptable” risk to privacy and security and said the app would be removed from devices and employees blocked from downloading it.\nDenmark\nDenmark’s Defense Ministry banned its employees from having TikTok on their work phones, ordering staffers who have installed it to remove the app from devices as soon as possible. The ministry said the reasons for the ban included both “weighty security considerations” as well as “very limited work-related need to use the app.”\nEuropean Union\nThe European Parliament, European Commission and the EU Council, the 27-member bloc’s three main institutions, have imposed bans on TikTok on staff devices. Under the European Parliament’s ban, lawmakers and staff were also advised to remove the TikTok app from their personal devices.\nFrance\n“Recreational” use of TikTok and other social media apps like Twitter and Instagram on government employees’ phones has been banned because of worries about insufficient data security measures. The French government didn’t name specific apps but noted the decision came after other governments took measures targeting TikTok.\nIndia\nIndia imposed a nationwide ban on TikTok and dozens of other Chinese apps like messaging app WeChat in 2020 over privacy and security concerns. The ban came shortly after a clash between Indian and Chinese troops at a disputed Himalayan border killed 20 Indian soldiers and injured dozens. The companies were given a chance to respond to questions on privacy and security requirements but the ban was made permanent in 2021.\nLatvia\nForeign Minister Edgars Rinkevics tweeted that he deleted his TikTok account and that the app is also prohibited from official foreign ministry smartphones.\nNetherlands\nThe Dutch central government banned apps including TikTok from employee work phones citing data security concerns. A government statement did not name TikTok specifically but said civil servants are discouraged from having apps “from countries with an offensive cyber program against the Netherlands and/or Dutch interests installed and used on their mobile work devices.”\nNepal\nThe Himalayan country imposed a nationwide ban on TikTok, saying it was disrupting “social harmony” and goodwill and blaming it for a “flow of indecent materials.” Authorities ordered the telecom company to block access to the app.\nNew Zealand\nLawmakers in New Zealand and staff at the nation’s Parliament are prohibited from having the TikTok app on their work phones, following advice from government cybersecurity experts. The app was removed from all devices with access to the parliamentary network, although officials can make special arrangements for anybody who needs TikTok to perform their democratic duties.\nNorway\nThe Norwegian parliament banned Tiktok on work devices after the country’s Justice Ministry warned the app shouldn’t be installed on phones issued to government employees. The Parliament’s speaker said TikTok shouldn’t be on devices that have access to the assembly’s systems and should be removed as quickly as possible. The country’s capital Oslo and second largest city Bergen also urged municipal employees to remove TikTok from their work phones.\nPakistan\nPakistani authorities have temporarily banned TikTok at least four times since 2020, citing concerns that the app promotes immoral content.\nSomalia\nThe government ordered telecom companies to block access to TikTok, along with messaging app Telegram and gambling platform 1XBET. Officials said they were concerned that the platforms could spread extremist content, nude images and other material seen as offensive to Somali culture and Islam.\nTaiwan\nTaiwan imposed a public sector ban on TikTok after the FBI warned that the app posed a national security risk. Government devices, including mobile phones, tablets and desktop computers, are not allowed to use Chinese-made software, which includes apps like TikTok, its Chinese equivalent Douyin, or Xiaohongshu, a Chinese lifestyle content app.\nUnited Kingdom\nBritish authorities banned TikTok from mobile phones used by government ministers and civil servants. Officials said the ban was a “precautionary move” on security grounds and doesn’t apply to personal devices. The British Parliament followed up by banning TikTok from all official devices and the “wider parliamentary network.” The semi-autonomous Scottish government and London City Hall also banned TikTok from staff devices. The BBC urged staff to delete TikTok from corporate devices unless they’re using it for editorial and marketing reasons.\nUnited States\nUS authorities ordered government agencies to delete TikTok from federal devices and systems over data security concerns. More than half of the 50 U.S. states also have banned the app from official devices, as have Congress and the US armed forces. Montana's efforts to bring in a state-wide ban failed, as did a proposal in Virginia to block kids from using it.\nTags:\n#Tech\nKeywords:\nTikTok Ban\nTikTok\nByteDance\nSHARE\nURL berhasil di salin."

    "content": "Jakarta.\nConcerns over the Middle East conflicts are growing in the ASEAN region, even beating other geopolitical issues such as the South China Sea tensions, according to a report.&nbsp;\nThink-tank ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute recently launched its 2024 edition of the State of Southeast Asia survey report. The report provides a snapshot of how Southeast Asians perceive what their governments consider a top geopolitical concern, among other things. And data shows that the Middle East tension --particularly the conflict between Israel and the Palestinian militant group Hamas -- rises to be the top geopolitical concern overall for the governments in the ASEAN region.\n“The Oct. 7 attacks by Hamas on Israeli civilians and the ensuing humanitarian crisis in Gaza occupies the region’s mindshare [46.5 percent]. The second-ranked [geopolitical] concern is aggressive behavior in the South China Sea [39.9 percent],” the survey report reads.&nbsp;\nThe individual ASEAN members, however, have different levels of concern about the tensions between Israel and Hamas. Muslim-majority countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and Brunei Darussalam tend to be more concerned about what is happening in the Middle East.&nbsp;\nAdvertisement\nAbout 83.1 percent of the Malaysian respondents picked the Israel-Hamas conflict as their country’s main geopolitical concern, followed by Brunei Darussalam (79.2 percent) and Indonesia (74.7 percent). Some 57.9 percent of the Singaporean respondents also considered their government highly concerned over the said conflict.&nbsp;\nBut other governments have their minds elsewhere. As a case in point, Vietnam and the Philippines are mainly worried about the situation in the South China Sea, the report finds. Both countries are among the claimant states of the strategic waterway.\nThe survey had 1,994 respondents -- all coming from the 10 ASEAN member states.\nThe report, however, came out before the latest escalation of the Middle East tension: Iran’s retaliatory strike on Israel over the weekend.&nbsp;\nThe respective ASEAN members have issued their country statements on the strike. Malaysia called Iran’s aerial attack a legitimate act, while Indonesia urged all parties to exercise self-restraint. Close neighbor Singapore condemned Iran’s attacks. The Philippines “expressed serious concerns” over the increasing tensions.&nbsp;\nForeign Affairs Minister Retno Marsudi recently contacted her counterparts from other countries such as Germany, Saudi Arabia, and Jordan, among others, to use their influence to de-escalate the situation. She also already had a phone call with Iranian top diplomat Hossein Amir-Abdollahian.\nASEAN as a group has not come up with a joint statement regarding the Iranian drone attack. However, it took about two weeks since the Gaza conflict intensified after the Oct. 7 attack&nbsp;for the Southeast Asian bloc to issue a response. Then-chair Indonesia said at the time that the group’s members had already issued their individual statements.\n“But among all the different national positions, we always have commonalities. We always try to find the middle ground that can be used as the ASEAN position. Because there were already individual statements of each country,” Retno said in Jakarta last October, commenting on why it took long for the Southeast Asian grouping to respond to the Gaza conflict.\nTags:\n#International\n#Asean\nKeywords:\nMiddle East conflict\nTension in Middle East\nIsrael-Hamas\nIsrael-Iran Conflict\nAsean\nASEAN on Middle East Conflict\nRetno Marsudi\nSHARE\nURL berhasil di salin."

    "content": "New York.\nThe Federal Trade Commission is investigating TikTok over its data and security practices in the United States, a probe that could lead to a settlement or a lawsuit against the company, according to a person familiar with the matter.\nThe investigation is the latest battle in Washington for the social media company, which is already fighting against a federal bill that could ban the platform in the US if it doesn’t break ties with its Beijing-based parent company, ByteDance.\nIn its investigation, the FTC has been looking into whether TikTok violated a portion of federal law that prohibits “unfair and deceptive” business practices by denying that individuals in China had access to US user data, said the person, who is not authorized to discuss the investigation.\nThe agency also is scrutinizing the company over potential violations of the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, which requires kid-oriented apps and websites to get parents’ consent before collecting personal information of children under 13.\nAdvertisement\nFTC spokesperson Nicole Drayton and TikTok declined to comment on the investigation, which was first reported by Politico.\nThe agency is nearing the conclusion of its investigation and could settle with TikTok in the coming weeks. But there’s not a deadline for an agreement, the person said.\nIf the FTC moves forward with a lawsuit instead, it would have to refer the case to the Justice Department, which would have 45 days to decide whether it wants to file a case on the FTC’s behalf, make changes or send it back to the agency to pursue on its own.\nThe news comes nearly two years after Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Mark Warner and Marco Rubio, the top Republican on the committee, urged FTC chair Lina Khan to investigate TikTok, citing a report from Buzzfeed News that said ByteDance employees in China have repeatedly accessed data on US TikTok users.\nIn late 2022, ByteDance said it fired four employees who accessed data on journalists from Buzzfeed News and The Financial Times while attempting to track down leaks of confidential materials about the company.\nLegislation that could determine TikTok’s fate in the US was approved in the House this month. But the bill has already run into roadblocks in the Senate, where there is little unanimity on how to best approach concerns over the social platform.\nLawmakers and intelligence officials have said they worry the platform could be used by the Chinese government to access US user data or influence Americans through its popular algorithm. To date, the US government hasn’t provided public evidence that this has happened.\nTags:\n#Tech\nKeywords:\nTikTok\nFederal Trade Commission\nByteDance\nSHARE\nURL berhasil di salin."

    "content": "Kuala Lumpur.\nThe billionaire sultan who rules Malaysia’s Johor state was sworn in as the nation’s new king Wednesday under a unique rotating monarchy system.\nSultan Ibrahim Iskandar, 65, took his oath of office at the palace and signed the instrument of the proclamation of office in a ceremony witnessed by other royal families, Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim and Cabinet members. A coronation ceremony will be held later.\nOne of the richest men in the country, Sultan Ibrahim has an extensive business empire ranging from real estate to telecoms and power plants. The candid monarch has close ties with Anwar and his rule could bolster Anwar’s unity government, which faces a strong Islamic opposition.\nNine ethnic Malay state rulers have taken turns as king for five-year terms under the world’s only such system since Malaysia gained independence from Britain in 1957. Malaysia has 13 states but only nine have royal families, some that trace their roots to centuries-old Malay kingdoms that were independent states until they were brought together by the British.\nAdvertisement\nSultan Ibrahim's election to the national throne by his fellow rulers in October was widely expected based on an established rotation order. Sultan Nazrin Shah, the ruler of Perak state and next in line to the throne, was reelected as deputy king.\nWhat Is the King's Role?\nKnown as the Yang Di-Pertuan Agong, or He Who is Made Lord, the king plays a largely ceremonial role, as administrative power is vested in the prime minister and Parliament. The monarch is the nominal head of the government and armed forces, and is highly regarded as the protector of Islam and Malay tradition. All laws, Cabinet appointments and the dissolution of Parliament for general elections require his assent. The king has the power to proclaim an emergency and pardon criminals.\nSultan Ibrahim succeeded Sultan Abdullah Sultan Ahmad Shah of Pahang state, who presided over a tumultuous period that included COVID-19 lockdowns and political instability.\nThe political influence of the king has grown in recent years. Sultan Abdullah intervened in the past to decide who became prime minister, including naming Anwar as prime minister after 2022 general elections led to a hung parliament.\nSultan Ibrahim has indicated he will maintain a hands-on approach. He said in an interview with the Singapore Straits Times published last month that he would not want to waste five years on the throne as a “puppet king” but will focus on fighting graft and deepening unity in the country. The sultan and other rulers have also warned against attempts by the opposition to oust Anwar’s government, calling instead for political stability.\nWho Is Sultan Ibrahim?\nSultan Ibrahim, whose mother is English, is also vocal about welfare issues and takes annual road trips on his motorbike to meet the people in his state.\nHe has also made no secret of his wealth. Earlier Wednesday, the sultan flew from Johor to Kuala Lumpur on his private jet, a gold -and-blue Boeing 737. Apart from a fleet of jets, he has an extensive collection of cars and motorcycles, as well as properties abroad. Sultan Ibrahim is also the only ruler with a private army — a condition agreed upon for the state to join modern-day Malaysia.\nSultan Ibrahim's high corporate profile — including a stake in the multibillion-dollar Forest City development project in Johor with China’s beleaguered developer Country Garden — has raised eyebrows amid concerns of a possible conflict of interest. He told the Singapore Straits Times that he plans to revive a high-speed rail link project with Singapore and bolster the troubled Forest City project.\nBut the sultan has defended his business dealings. In 2015, he quipped that he has to “earn a living, like ordinary Malaysians” as he cannot rely on his 27,000 ringgit ($5,700) monthly state allowance.\nHis wife Raja Zarith Sofiah, who is from another royal family, is an Oxford graduate and a prolific writer who has authored several children’s books. They have five sons and a daughter.\nTags:\n#People\nKeywords:\nSultan Ibrahim Iskandar\nMalaysian King\nmonarchy\nSHARE\nURL berhasil di salin."

    "content": "Taipei.\nRuling-party candidate Lai Ching-te emerged victorious in Taiwan’s presidential election on Saturday, a result that will determine the trajectory of the self-ruled democracy’s contentious relations with China over the next four years.\nChina had called the poll a choice between war and peace. Beijing strongly opposes Lai, the current vice president who abandoned his medical career to pursue politics from the grassroots to the presidency.\nAt stake is peace, social stability and prosperity on the island, 160 kilometers (100 miles) off the coast of China, which Beijing claims as its own and to be retaken by force if necessary. China is run by the Communist Party, which allows no political opposition.\nWhile domestic issues such as the sluggish economy and expensive housing also featured prominently in the campaign, Lai's Democratic Progressive Party's appeal to self-determination, social justice and rejection of China's threats ultimately won out. It's the first time a single party has led Taiwan for three consecutive four-year presidential terms since the first open presidential election in 1996.\nAdvertisement\nAt a post-election news conference, Lai thanked the Taiwanese electorate for “writing a new chapter in our democracy. We have shown the world how much we cherish our democracy. This is our unwavering commitment.”\nHe added: “Taiwan will continue to walk side by side with democracies from around the world ... through our actions. The Taiwanese people have successfully resisted efforts from external forces to influence this election.\"\nLai supporter Hsieh Hsin-chou, a 57-year-old physical therapist, said he was “very proud” of the election result.\n“We choose our own president in Taiwan. We are a country. We are a country. We are a light of the world. We love freedom. We love democracy. We (are) supposed to choose our new president,” Hsieh said.\nLai and incumbent President Tsai Ing-wen reject China’s sovereignty claims over Taiwan, a former Japanese colony that split from the Chinese mainland amid civil war in 1949. They have, however, offered to speak with Beijing, which has repeatedly refused to hold talks and called them separatists.\nBeijing was believed to have favored the candidate from the more China-friendly Nationalist party, also known as Kuomintang, or KMT. Its candidate, Hou Yu-ih, also had promised to restart talks with China while bolstering national defense. He had vowed not to move toward unifying the two sides of the Taiwan Strait if elected.\nIn his concession speech, Hou apologized for “not working hard enough” to regain power for the KMT, which ran Taiwan under martial law for nearly four decades before democratic reforms in the 1980s.\n“I let everyone down. I am here to express my sincerest apologies, I’m sorry,\" Hou said in front of an audience whose numbers fell well short of expectations.\nHou supporter David Chiau, who works in information technology, said the loss came as a shock, but he was pleased by the turnout for the KMT, which he had hoped could have merged with the opposition.\nA third candidate in the race, Ko Wen-je of the smaller Taiwan People’s Party, or TPP, had drawn the support particularly of young people wanting an alternative to the KMT and DPP, Taiwan’s traditional opposing parties, which have largely taken turns governing since the 1990s.\nKo said that dialogue between the sides was crucial, but that his bottom line would be that Taiwan needs to remain democratic and free.\n“At least this time the TPP has become a critical opposition power. I would like to say thank you to every one again, as the chairman of the TPP,\" Ko said. “Each vote represents recognition and support for us.”\n\"This is also the first time that Taiwan managed to create a whole new three-party-competition between the clash of the green and blue,” he said, referring to the DPP and the KMT by the colors with which they are affiliated.\nChen Binhua, spokesperson of the Chinese Cabinet's Taiwan Affairs Office, said that Beijing wouldn't accept the election result as representing “the mainstream public opinion on the island,” without giving any evidence or justification.\n“This election cannot change the basic situation and the direction of cross Strait relations, nor can it change the common desire of compatriots on both sides to get closer and closer, nor can it stop the general trend that the motherland will eventually and inevitably be reunified,” Chen said.\nThe United States, which is bound by its laws to provide Taiwan with the weapons needed to defend itself, had pledged support for whichever government emerges, reinforced by the Biden administration’s plans to send an unofficial delegation made up of former senior officials to the island shortly after the election.\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken congratulated Lai on his victory.\n“We also congratulate the Taiwan people for once again demonstrating the strength of their robust democratic system and electoral process,” Blinken said in a statement.\nLai won nearly 5.6 million votes, amassing just over 40 percent, while Hou claimed 33.5 percent. Ko garnered 26.5 percent.\nTags:\n#International\nKeywords:\nTaiwan Election\nLai Ching-te\nChina-Taiwan Tension\nSHARE\nURL berhasil di salin."

    "content": "Jakarta.\nIt can’t be helped for Indonesia to ask foreign investors to fund the collosal project of relocating the capital from Jakarta to Nusantara in East Kalimantan, but it is best for the government to not rely on one source of foreign investment, according to an analyst.\nPresident Joko “Jokowi” Widodo has been pursuing international funding for the Nusantara megaproject whenever he meets world leaders or business representatives. Jokowi recently said the total costs to build Nusantara amounted to a whopping $33 billion.&nbsp;\nGanewati Wuryandari, a researcher at the Research Center for Politics at the National Research and Innovation Agency (PRP-BRIN), said it was understandable that the government had been sparing no effort to attract foreign investors to help Indonesia build a city from scratch.&nbsp;\n“In an ideal world, it is best for us [Indonesia] to entirely fund the Nusantara project ourselves, but considering how huge the investment is needed, of course, that would be impossible. Especially since our economy has just recovered from the Covid-19 pandemic,” Ganewati told the 2023 Conference on Indonesian Foreign Policy in Jakarta over the weekend.\nAdvertisement\n“But one thing that we should keep in mind is we must diversify our sources of investment. We should minimize the risks by not relying on one single country,” Ganewati said.\nChina has been a major source of foreign direct investment (FDI) over the past years. Government data shows it consistently sits in the top 3 of Indonesia’s largest foreign investors in 2019-2022. China became Indonesia’s second-largest FDI source in January-September 2023. FDI from China amounted to $5.6 billion over the said period.\nGanewati directed the forum’s attention to the China Index which captured Chinese influence across several domains, including the economy, in other countries. The 2022 China Index placed Indonesia in 16th place out of 82 countries with the economy becoming one of the most Chinese-influenced domains. Indonesia ranks just behind Kazakhstan.\n“We ranked 16th on the China Index.&nbsp;This shows that there is a correlation between a country’s economic dependence on another country with the latter’s influence. Such indexes should be a warning,” Ganewati said.\nThe Nusantara Authority Body on Nov. 20 reported that the megaproject had received 305 letters of intent (LOIs) from domestic and foreign investors wishing to help build the new capital.&nbsp;\nData shows that 172 of those LOIs came from domestic institutions. Singapore emerged as the foreign country that showed the most interest in the Nusantara with 27 LOIs. Seconded by Japan (25 LOIs). Malaysia and China both ranked third place by submitting 19 LOIs, respectively. Even so, the submission of LOIs is only the first step before the actual investments take shape. Interested investors will still need to have 1-on-1 meetings and undertake feasibility studies, among others.\nPresident Jokowi not long ago made headlines for saying that the megaproject had not received foreign investments. According to the Capital City Authority Body, while it is true that no foreign investor has made an individual investment in the project, a number of foreign institutions have already partnered with Indonesian firms. For instance, local real estate developer Pakuwon Jati has partnered with American hospitality giant Marriott International to build hotels in Nusantara.\n“So some have partnered with domestic partners. This aligns with what President Jokowi wants, that foreign investors must partner with domestic firms,” Agung Wicaksono, the deputy for funding at the Nusantara Authority Body, told a press briefing on Nov. 20.\nRead More:\nKorea’s Daewoo, Hutama Karya Ink MoU on Immersed Tunnel in Nusantara\nTags:\n#Economy\nKeywords:\nnusantara\nNew Capital Project\nLOI Nusantara\nGanewati Wuryandari\nConference on Indonesian Foreign Policy\nChinese Investment in Indonesia\n2022 China Index\nSHARE\nURL berhasil di salin."

France became the fourth stop of OIC’s diplomatic tour that aimed to garner support from United Nations (UN) Security Council permanent members.&nbsp;\nAccording to a clip of the meeting shown on Macron’s official account on the social media platform X, he had told the OIC delegation about France’s stance on the war. The French president said Paris condemned militant Hamas’ attack against Israel on Oct. 7. While France recognizes Israel’s right to self-defend, the European country condemns the killing of civilians.\n“We condemn the bombing of civilians and civilian infrastructures. Because there are no double standards for France,” Macron said.\nAdvertisement\nIndonesia’s Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi revealed more details on the meeting -- which she said lasted for quite a while -- in a separate press statement.\n“The [OIC] ministers welcome President Macron’s statement on how ‘there are no double standards for France’. The ministers hope France will use its influence to persuade other countries not to have double standards on the Palestine issue. The OIC ministers also called for a permanent ceasefire and unhindered humanitarian assistance,” Retno said.\nThe OIC diplomats also held a separate meeting with their&nbsp;French counterpart Catherine Colonna.&nbsp;According to Retno, the group told Colonna that it wants to see the UN Security Council pass a resolution -- particularly on humanitarian assistance -- that is more powerful and comprehensive.&nbsp;\nFrench Foreign Affairs Minister Catherine Colonna hosts a visit by her Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) counterparts in France on Nov. 22, 2023.

However, France was the only country out of the four to have its president host the OIC ministers. In past meetings, the OIC representatives only met their fellow foreign ministers -- China’s Wang Yi, Russia’s Sergey Lavrov, and the UK’s David Cameron.

OIC Secretary-General Hissein Brahim Taha was also present during the meeting with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi.\n“Our visit to Beijing … is to amass support, particularly from the UN Security Council permanent members, better known as the P5.

The resolution mandated the foreign ministers of Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Egypt, Qatar, Turkiye, Indonesia, and Nigeria to help initiate an international action to stop the Gaza war.\n“The OIC hopes China can support what the OIC foreign ministers are doing as the UN Security Council plans to hold a ministerial meeting on the Gaza situation later this month,” Retno said.\nThe minister revealed that the OIC diplomats were planning to visit Russia’s Moscow for the same reason the following day.&nbsp;\nAn Indonesian hospital in Gaza recently came under Israeli attack which killed at least a dozen people.

All countries, particularly those who have close relations with Israel, must use all of its influence and capabilities to urge Israel to stop their atrocities,” Retno said.\nThe UN Security Council just last week passed a resolution calling for urgent and extended humanitarian pauses in the Gaza Strip. The resolution also asked for the unconditional release of hostages held by Hamas. Twelve members voted in favor, while Russia, the US, and the UK&nbsp;abstained. China during the UN Security Council meeting said that the body should have adopted a more robust resolution earlier. Beijing also urged Israel to end hostilities against civilian facilities.\nTags:\n#International\nKeywords:\nCeasefire in Gaza\nOrganization of Islamic Cooperation\nOIC\nWang Yi\nChina and Gaza\nRetno Marsudi\nUN Security Council\nSHARE\nURL berhasil di salin."

    "content": "Taipei\n. The first time China faced Donald Trump in the White House, it endured a trade war, a protocol breach with Taiwan, and a \"bromance\" between presidents that soured. Now, as President-elect Trump gears up for a second term, China is bracing for a volatile relationship with the United States and renewed tensions over trade, technology, and Taiwan.\nA New Tariff War Looms\nThe most significant impact for China could be Trump’s campaign pledge to impose a blanket 60 percent tariff on all Chinese exports to the US. Such a tariff could deal a heavy blow to China's already shaky economy, which is burdened by high youth unemployment, a prolonged property slump, and mounting government debt. UBS analysts estimate that a 60 percent&nbsp;tariff could trim 2.5 percentage points, or nearly half, from China’s projected economic growth.\nIn Trump’s previous term, the US&nbsp;imposed tariffs on over $360 billion of Chinese goods, compelling Beijing to negotiate. A 2020 trade deal included commitments from China to improve intellectual property protections and purchase an additional $200 billion in American goods. However, studies later showed China fulfilled few of these promises. President Joe Biden retained most tariffs and recently added new duties on imports, including steel, solar cells, and electric vehicles.\nTariffs could again serve as leverage to bring Beijing to the negotiating table, said Henry Gao, an international trade law professor at Singapore Management University. “Given China’s weaker economic position now, there’s likely more willingness to talk,” he said. “While tariffs might have short-term impacts on China, the situation could improve once they reach an agreement.”\nAdvertisement\nFactoring into trade talks could be Trump’s appeal to Chinese President Xi Jinping to help negotiate peace in Ukraine, a feat Trump has claimed he could accomplish quickly, without specifying how. This echoes Trump’s past requests for Xi's help in managing North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong Un. Trump could similarly balance trade grievances with soliciting China’s assistance in global crises, according to Wang Huiyao, founder of the Beijing-based think tank Center for China and Globalization.\nGoing 'Crazy' Over Taiwan\nTrump has threatened to impose even higher tariffs — 150 percent&nbsp;to 200 percent&nbsp;— if China invades Taiwan, a self-governing democracy that Beijing claims as its own. While the US&nbsp;doesn’t formally recognize Taiwan as a country, it remains Taiwan’s strongest backer and largest arms supplier.\nTrump caused a stir in 2016 by accepting a congratulatory call from Taiwan’s then-President Tsai Ing-wen, breaking diplomatic protocol. No US&nbsp;president had spoken directly to a Taiwanese leader since US-China relations were established in 1979. Trump ultimately stuck with supporting the status quo between Taipei and Beijing, a stance China expects him to maintain, said Zhu Feng, dean of the School of International Relations at Nanjing University.\nMeanwhile, Trump told\nThe Wall Street Journal\nhe would avoid military force to prevent a blockade of Taiwan because Xi “respects me and he knows I’m (expletive) crazy.” On the campaign trail, Trump sometimes highlighted his personal rapport with Xi, which soured over trade disputes and the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, Trump has also argued that Taiwan should “pay” the US&nbsp;for its protection, likening it to an insurance arrangement. Taiwan allocates about 2.5 percent&nbsp;of its GDP to defense and recently purchased hundreds of millions in US&nbsp;weapons.\nTrump’s unpredictable stance on China keeps Beijing on edge, said Da Wei, director of the Center for International Security and Strategy at Tsinghua University. “We understand the challenges,” he said. “As for opportunities, we’re yet to see them clearly.”\nDisputes over Chips\nIn his first term, Trump targeted Chinese tech firms over security concerns, including telecom giant Huawei. Biden expanded this focus by restricting China’s access to advanced semiconductors, essential for strategic industries like artificial intelligence.\nHowever, Trump has criticized Biden’s CHIPS and Science Act, a bipartisan initiative allocating $53 billion to boost domestic semiconductor manufacturing. Currently, Taiwan produces nearly 90 percent&nbsp;of the world’s advanced chips. Taiwan’s largest chipmaker, TSMC, has expanded production in Arizona to comply with the CHIPS Act and mitigate potential US&nbsp;protectionist measures, said Shihoko Goto, Indo-Pacific Program director at the Wilson Center.\nTrump has vowed to dismantle the CHIPS Act, a move critics say could weaken his reindustrialization campaign. He has also accused Taiwan of “stealing” the US&nbsp;chip industry decades ago. “Rather than providing a silicon shield, Taiwan’s chip dominance could actually spark tension with Trump, as it could be seen as a result of the US being taken advantage of,” Goto said.\nTags:\n#International\nKeywords:\nDonald Trump\nXi Jinping\nUS election\ntrade war\nSHARE\nURL berhasil di salin."

    "content": "Jakarta.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;To advance the regional value chains, ASEAN countries need to invest in semiconductor capabilities and collaborate, with each nation specializing\n&nbsp;in different supply chain aspects for a more resilient industry.\nThe global semiconductor industry is a cornerstone of modern technology, driving innovation across a wide array of sectors such as consumer electronics, computers, automotive, information and communication technologies (ICT), digital technologies, and artificial intelligence (AI). As the demand for semiconductors continues to surge, the ASEAN region has been gaining recognition for its pivotal role in this field. The growth of the semiconductor industry in ASEAN has been partly driven by rising tensions between the US and China, as well as the well-established semiconductor sectors in Southeast Asia, particularly in Singapore and Malaysia.\nThe US-China tensions in trade, technology, and security have positioned ASEAN as an alternative for the diversification of input imports and for FDI relocation. In terms of trade diversification, total exports of goods from ASEAN increased by 26.1 percent, from USD 1.43 trillion in 2018 to USD 1.81 trillion in 2023. In 2023, ASEAN exports to the US surged by 68.4 percent, from USD 142.4 billion in 2018 to USD 269.8 billion, while exports to Europe rose by 11 percent, from USD 141.1 billion in 2018 to USD 156.6 billion. During the same period, while FDI into China dropped by 91.5 percent, FDI into ASEAN increased by 58 percent (aseanstats.org, accessed on 30 July 2024).\nIn 2023, ASEAN’s top export categories by value to the world included electrical machinery and equipment, fuels and oils, and mechanical appliances. Notably, the region saw significant growth in semiconductor exports, which increased by 41.6 percent, rising from USD 189.9 billion in 2018 to USD 268.8 billion in 2023. This growth highlights ASEAN’s substantial role in the global semiconductor market. In 2023, the total value of the world’s semiconductor exports reached USD 1.14 trillion, with ASEAN contributing USD 268.8 billion, accounting for 23.6 percent of the global semiconductor exports (ITC Database, accessed on 31 July 2024).\nAdvertisement\nTo further develop the semiconductor industry in ASEAN, the success stories of Taiwan and South Korea —two of the world’s semiconductor powerhouses—can offer valuable lessons that ASEAN countries can learn from and apply.\nStrategic Investments\nOne of the fundamental factors behind the success of Taiwan and South Korea in the semiconductor industry is the proactive role of their governments in developing not only hard infrastructure, but also soft infrastructure. In Taiwan, the government laid the groundwork for the semiconductor industry as early as the 1980s by establishing the Hsinchu Science Park, a hub for technology and innovation. This initiative was complemented by\nsubstantial government investment in research and development\n(R&amp;D), creating a fertile environment for companies like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) to thrive. Today, TSMC is the world’s largest contract chipmaker, accounting for over 50 percent of the global semiconductor market share.\nSimilarly, the South Korean government played a crucial role in the rise of its semiconductor industry. The ‘Miracle on the Han River,’ a term that describes\nSouth Korea\n’\ns rapid industriali\nz\nation and economic growth, was partly fuelled by substantial government support\nfor key industries, including semiconductors. The South Korean government provided tax incentives and developed infrastructure to bolster semiconductor firms. Companies like\nSamsung Electronics and SK Hynix benefitted\nfrom these policies, enabling them to become global leaders in semiconductor manufacturing and memory chips.\nFor ASEAN, the lesson is that government support is crucial. Countries like Singapore, Malaysia, and Vietnam have recognised this by offering incentives to attract semiconductor investments. However, it is important to ensure that these incentives are focused on providing infrastructure and encouraging innovation and R&amp;D, with a clear framework outlining how to obtain these incentives and a defined exit strategy. This approach will prevent governments from being trapped in a cycle of providing endless incentives without any evident outputs and/or outcomes. Additionally, a more coordinated regional approach could further strengthen ASEAN’s position. This initiative should be agreed upon and supported by all ASEAN countries, with\nSingapore and Malaysia\npotentially leading the effort, as they are relatively advanced in the semiconductor industry compared to their peers. Establishing semiconductor hubs, akin to Taiwan’s Hsinchu Science Park, and investing in R&amp;D are essential steps for ASEAN countries to develop a competitive edge in this high-tech industry.\nIndustry–Academia Collaboration\nAnother key factor in the success of Taiwan and South Korea’s semiconductor industries is the strong collaboration between industry and academia. In Taiwan, the\nIndustrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI)\nplayed a pivotal role in bridging the gap between research and industry. ITRI’s efforts in semiconductor R&amp;D provided the technical expertise that local companies needed to innovate and compete on a global scale. This collaboration has been instrumental in driving continuous innovation, enabling Taiwan to stay at the forefront of semiconductor technology.\nSouth Korea adopted\na similar approach\n, with both\nthe government and private sector investing\nheavily in education and training programs specifically tailored to the semiconductor industry. Universities, vocational training centers, and research institutions in South Korea work closely in collaboration with companies like\nSamsung and SK Hynix\nto ensure a steady pipeline of skilled engineers, researchers, and workers. This symbiotic relationship between academia and industry has been vital in maintaining South Korea’s competitive advantage in semiconductors.\nASEAN countries can learn from this model by fostering stronger ties between universities, research institutions, and the semiconductor industry. Developing specialized programmes focused on semiconductor technology and ensuring that academic research aligns with industry needs can help ASEAN build a workforce capable of driving innovation in this field. Countries like\nSingapore\n, which already have a robust education system and research infrastructure, can lead this effort by establishing centres of excellence dedicated to semiconductor research and innovation.\nBuilding a Robust Regional Supply Chain\nThe semiconductor industry is highly complex and demands a well-established supply chain that supports each stage of production, from the procurement of raw materials to the delivery of finished products. Taiwan and South Korea have successfully built robust supply chains, which have enabled them to maintain leading positions in the global semiconductor market.\nIn semiconductors, there are three main stages of production: R&amp;D, wafer fabrication, and assembly, testing, and packaging (ATP). In Taiwan, the semiconductor supply chain is tightly integrated, with companies like TSMC, ASE Technology, and MediaTek playing crucial roles at different stages of the production process.\nThis integration has enabled Taiwan\nto maintain high levels of efficiency and quality control, which are essential for producing advanced semiconductors. Likewise,\nSouth Korea has developed a strong supply chain, supported by its conglomerates\n, or\nchaebols\n, such as Samsung and LG. These conglomerates have vertically integrated their operations, controlling everything from semiconductor design to manufacturing and distribution. This level of integration not only ensures a steady supply of components but also fosters greater innovation and responsiveness to market demands.10\nIn the case of ASEAN, building a robust semiconductor supply chain presents a critical challenge. The region is already a significant player in wafer fabrication and ATP. Singapore and Malaysia are key contributors to the global semiconductor industry, with Vietnam also emerging as a notable player recently. Singapore specializes in wafer fabrication, accounting for about 11 percent of global production (ITC Database, accessed on 1 August 2024), while Malaysia focuses on ATP, contributing approximately 5.4 percent to global ATP (ITC Database, accessed on 1 August 2024). To advance up the regional value chains, ASEAN countries need to invest in developing capabilities across the entire semiconductor ecosystem, from wafer fabrication and design to R&amp;D. Collaboration among ASEAN countries is crucial, with each nation specialising in different aspects of the supply chain to create a more integrated and resilient regional semiconductor industry.\n---\nLili Yan Ing\n&nbsp;is Lead Advisor (Southeast Asia Region) at the Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia (ERIA) and also serves as Secretary General of the International Economic Association (IEA).\nRia Fortuna Wijaya\nis an independent consultant working on Southeast Asia.\nTags:\n#Trade\nKeywords:\nSemiconductor\nAsean\nTSMC\nSHARE\nURL berhasil di salin."

Indonesia exported $1.55 billion of coconuts that year, representing about 38.3 percent of the global market share. China, Malaysia, and Singapore were among the top Indonesian coconut buyers.\nPresident Joko “Jokowi” Widodo said Monday that there still remained room for growth for export, and capturing greater added value out of coconut through bioenergy could help Indonesia boost what it ships overseas annually. And Indonesia needs to take a look at coconut-based jet fuel as the green economy holds great potential for the country, according to Jokowi.&nbsp;\n“Creating greater added value is pivotal to job creation. Research is incredibly important. ... We need to make use of technologies, especially those related to the coconut downstream sector. I have seen coconut waste used for bioenergy. I think we really need to develop this. We can even turn coconuts into jet fuels,” Jokowi told an international coconut conference in Surabaya on Monday.&nbsp;\nAdvertisement\n“This is a huge task that we have to address. So we can promote the use [of sustainable or coconut-based aviation fuel] in other countries,” Jokowi said.\nIndonesia has begun using sustainable jet fuel, although its content derives from palm oil rather than coconuts. The state-run energy firm Pertamina produces this palm oil-based sustainable aviation fuel. Flag carrier Garuda Indonesia launched its first commercial flight using this type of jet fuel last October.&nbsp;\nJokowi’s successor Prabowo Subianto has spoken of sustainable aviation fuel in his campaign manifesto. According to the document, Prabowo -- who will rise to power this October -- seeks to carry on Jokowi’s biodiesel and sustainable jet fuel policies.

    "content": "In recent years, the number of cyber adversaries using hands-on tactics to achieve their objectives increased by\n50 percent globally in 2022\n. In particular, financially motivated cybercrime&nbsp;adversaries have matured and refined their tradecraft, with the underground economy thriving like never before in history.\n&nbsp;\nIt’s important to highlight, however, the barrier to entry to commit a cyber-attack has been dramatically reduced. It is not just the most highly skilled adversaries – often associated with nation-state activity - perpetrating interactive cyber-attacks.\nIn reality, the evolving ecosystem, including an increasing trend around access-broker activity, has opened the door to a whole new class of adversaries.&nbsp;\nIn fact, sophisticated cybercrime&nbsp;groups have built businesses off the sale of compromised credentials and pre-established access, as well as step-by-step playbooks enabling adversaries of all skill levels to conduct hands-on intrusions. This most often manifests itself through ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS).\n&nbsp;\nIn today's digital landscape, financial services have become one of the most targeted industries for cyber threats.\nPersistent data breaches and digital attacks targeting Indonesia’s banking industry in recent years – including the breach earlier this year that leaked personal information of 15 million customers and staff members of Bank Syariah Indonesia (BSI) – underscores this challenge.\nAdvertisement\nThe digital transformation including transitioning workloads and apps to the cloud has also contributed to the increased targeting of the financial services industry.\nThis, and the adoption of hybrid-work practices as a result of the pandemic, has expanded the attack surface for attackers to exploit, making customer data management and protection increasingly difficult. In addition, tighter regulatory compliance adds more pressure to already stretched financial services security teams.\n&nbsp;\nUnderstanding the Threat Landscape\n&nbsp;\nThe financial services industry, along with government and telecommunications sectors, frequently finds itself in the crosshairs of nation-state threat actors. These actors are driven by political or nationalistic motivations, shaping their objectives and strategies.\nFor instance, we’ve seen Chinese threat actors align their actions with China's five-year plan, as well as the Made in China 2025 initiative. Their goals range from economic espionage and intellectual property theft to foreign intelligence collection and, in rare cases, even physical infrastructure attacks.\nWhile nation-state actors from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea&nbsp;(DPRK) focus on their National Economic Development Plan, and currency generation, specifically targeting crypto-currency exchanges and financial technology (fintech) companies for financial gain.&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\nRecent observations by CrowdStrike's OverWatch Threat hunting team reveal a staggering surge of more than 130 percent&nbsp;in nation-state intrusions against financial services entities based in Asia Pacific and Japan (APJ) region&nbsp;in 2022.\nTo stay ahead of evolving threats and prevent breaches, it is crucial for financial institutions to fully appreciate the threats they face by understanding adversary tradecraft, while also deploying robust security solutions that offer critical visibility and prevention capabilities.\n&nbsp;\nMotivations and Targets\n&nbsp;\nNation-state threat actors target the financial services industry due to the sector's possession of highly sensitive data, including trade secrets and confidential communications. Moreover, they seek privileged access to industrial systems connected to the internet, expanding their attacks into critical infrastructure such as power plants.\n&nbsp;\nThe Vulnerable Sectors in Asia\n&nbsp;\nWithin Asia, financial, government, technology, and telecommunications are among the vulnerable sectors. Notably, intrusions by China-nexus adversaries accounted for nearly two-thirds of targeted intrusion activities confirmed in 2022, according to\nCrowdStrike’s Global Threat Report 2023\n.\nChina-nexus threat actors primarily focus on foreign intelligence collection rather than disruption. Telecommunications and technology organizations are especially high-priority targets due to ongoing economic espionage campaigns targeting research and development data, proprietary information, and trade secrets.\nIntrusions into telecommunications entities enable adversaries to enhance intelligence collection and surveillance efforts by gaining direct access to foreign telecommunications infrastructure.\n&nbsp;\nSafeguarding the Financial Services Industry\n&nbsp;\nTo defend against nation-state cyber threats, financial institutions must adopt a proactive approach. Here are the top five steps to enhance security and safeguard their operations:\n&nbsp;\nUse integrated, comprehensive endpoint protection: Deploy an integrated endpoint protection platform that includes anti-malware, application control, endpoint detection and response (EDR), vulnerability management, device control, and data protection.\nEmbrace cloud-native security: Leverage cloud-native security solutions that provide comprehensive visibility and protection across diverse environments, including on-premises and cloud infrastructure\nSecure the identity: Organizations should prioritize measures such as multi-factor authentication, privileged access management, and user behavior analytics to detect and prevent unauthorized access attempts\nFocus defensive efforts on adversary behaviors: By monitoring and correlating diverse data sources, such as network traffic, endpoint telemetry, and threat intelligence, organizations can identify patterns and anomalies associated with malicious activities. This proactive approach allows organizations to detect and respond to emerging threats before they can cause significant damage\nKnow your adversary: Understanding the motivations, techniques, and tactics employed by threat actors is crucial in building effective defense strategies. Organizations should invest in threat intelligence programs and resources that provide insights into the evolving threat landscape. This knowledge empowers organizations to make informed decisions, prioritize security investments, and enhance their overall cybersecurity posture\n&nbsp;\nAdditionally, organisations should foster collaboration and invest in employee education. By following these five steps, financial institutions can safeguard their operations and stay one step ahead of adversaries.\nScott Jarkoff is the director of intelligence strategy for Asia Pacific, Japan, Middle East, Turkey and Africa regions at&nbsp;CrowdStrike, an Austin-based cybersecurity technology company.\n&nbsp;\nTags:\n#Tech\nKeywords:\ncybercrime\nBSI\nCrowdStrike\nDPRK\nSHARE\nURL berhasil di salin."

    "content": "Jakarta.\nIn less than 24 hours, Indonesia’s outgoing leader Joko “Jokowi” Widodo will leave office after ruling the country for a decade. Jokowi's 10-year tenure has marked a series of significant milestones in infrastructure development, including the construction of Southeast Asia’s first high-speed railway.\nLast year, Jokowi inaugurated the China-funded Jakarta-Bandung High-Speed railway. The $7.3 billion rail, also known as Whoosh, has recorded over millions of passengers to this day. The project has caught the attention of other countries with fellow ASEAN member Vietnam mulling to build its very own high-speed rail.&nbsp;\n“Whoosh is the first of its kind in Indonesia and Southeast Asia. … It marks the modernization of our mass transport that is efficient, eco-friendly, and is integrated with other modes of transport,” Jokowi said when launching the high-speed rail project last October.\nThe high-speed railway enables people to travel from the capital Jakarta to Bandung city in just 45 minutes. A single trip starts at around Rp 300,000 ($19.39).&nbsp;\nAdvertisement\nAs of September, about 5.8 million passengers had tried riding the railway that can travel 350 kilometers in an hour, according to the project’s consortium Kereta Cepat Indonesia-China (KCIC) on Friday. Whoosh reported that it could now serve up to 22,000 passengers in a single day, a massive jump from just 8,000 passengers in Oct. 2023. Whoosh now serves 48 trips in a day, marking a 242 percent increase from just 14 trips when it first started.\nPresident Joko \"Jokowi\" Widodo and First Lady Iriana ride the Whoosh railway for a business trip to West Java on July 19, 2024.

This initiative, which is the centerpiece of Xi’s foreign diplomacy, sees China making colossal infrastructure investments across the globe. The China Development Bank covered 75 percent of the total costs to build Whoosh, while the rest of the money came from the consortium’s own funds.&nbsp;\nThe government is mulling extending the tracks to the East Javan capital of Surabaya. The time efficiency that the Whoosh project offers gave Jokowi a bonus point for his 10-year leadership. A recent survey by Indikator Politik Indonesia revealed that the public found the transportation to be satisfactory. The overall public transportation satisfaction index stood at 3.962 on a 1-5 scale with 5 being the highest.&nbsp;\nPassengers hop off the Jakarta-Bandung High-Speed Railway at Halim station in Jakarta on Oct. 7, 2024.

    "content": "Jakarta.\nPresident Joko “Jokowi” Widodo is about to wrap up his 10-year presidency with stronger economic ties between Indonesia and its trading partner China.&nbsp;\nSince taking the reins in 2014, Jokowi has grown closer ties&nbsp;with China’s President Xi Jinping, while also still maintaining Jakarta’s relations with the United States. Xi recently revealed that Jokowi flew to China 8 times and had met the Chinese leader 10 times over the past decade.&nbsp;\nBut the frequent visits were not the only proof of the stronger ties between Indonesia and China -- two countries that Jokowi believes will become “economic superpowers” in the future. Government data showed that bilateral trade has&nbsp;soared over the years, particularly in Jokowi’s second term.\nJokowi officially assumed his second consecutive term in Oct. 2019. The government reported that Indonesia-China trade amounted to almost $73 billion that year, and slightly dropped to $71.4 billion in the Covid-hit 2020. The figures then jumped to nearly $110 billion in 2021, and eventually $133.6 billion the following year. Indonesia-China trade totaled $127.8 billion in 2023, data showed. The bilateral trade already hit $84.8 billion in January-August 2024.\nAdvertisement\nJokowi’s presidency saw Indonesia finally signing the world’s largest trade pact Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) in 2020. Indonesia and China -- together with 13 other countries -- are part of this deal that aims to significantly cut import tariffs of the goods between the members. The RCEP came into effect in Indonesia early last year, while it already entered into force for China in 2022. ASEAN -- of which Indonesia is a member -- already has a free trade agreement with China, which is currently undergoing upgrades to include a green economy in its areas of cooperation.&nbsp;\nChina has also become a major investor in Indonesia. Countless Chinese firms are also participating in building Indonesia’s electric vehicle (EV) ecosystem. As a case in point, Jokowi launched the manufacturing plant of Chinese anode battery material giant BTR a few months ago. The government recently revealed that China had invested approximately $5.8 billion in January-September 2024. This made China Indonesia’s third largest source of foreign direct investment that period.&nbsp;&nbsp;\nPresident Joko 'Jokowi' Widodo launches the groundbreaking ceremony of Delonix Nusantara on Sep. 25, 2024. (Photo Courtesy of Presidential Press Bureau)\nDuring a visit to Beijing in 2023, Jokowi told Xi that “Indonesia hopes China can be a strategic partner in the construction of the future capital Nusantara.” Fast forward to September 2024, China’s Delonix Group began the construction of Delonix Nusantara -- a Rp 500 billion mixed-use project that will include office and apartment towers, among others.\nAs Jokowi gets closer to retirement, China’s Xi talked to Indonesia’s outgoing leader to bid a farewell by phone. “China highly appreciates Joko Widodo's important contribution to the China-Indonesia friendship,” the Chinese government wrote on its official website, commenting on Xi’s call with Jokowi.\nXi also talked of the $7.3 billion Jakarta-Bandung High-Speed Railway -- popularly known as Whoosh -- during the phone conversation. The railway construction is part of the Belt and Road Initiative -- Xi’s brainchild that sees China making mammoth infrastructure investments across the globe. China Development Bank’s loans covered 75 percent of the costs needed to construct Whoosh. Xi told Jokowi that Beijing was “ready” to partner with Indonesia for a high-quality Belt and Road cooperation, as well as the “sustainable operations” of the high-speed train.\nJokowi has laid the foundation for his successor Prabowo Subianto to take the economic ties and beyond to greater heights. Prabowo has said that he wanted to adopt a good neighbor policy in his diplomacy, saying that “1,000 friends are too few, but one enemy is too many”. Xi also appears to be upbeat about the diplomatic ties with Jakarta under Prabowo, saying that Beijing believes Indonesia will continue its friendly policy towards China.\nPresident Joko 'Jokowi' Widodo shakes hands with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping on the G20 Summit Gala Dinner in Bali on Nov. 15, 2024.

He said the attackers also fired rockets and lobbed grenades at the coal mine and damaged the machinery used for the mining before fleeing.\nMost of the men attacked were from Pashtun-speaking areas of Balochistan. Three of the dead and four of the wounded were Afghan. Angered over the attack, local shop owners pulled their shutters down to observe a daylong strike against the killing.\nAdvertisement\nNo group claimed immediate responsibility for the attack, but the suspicion is likely to fall on the outlawed Baloch Liberation Army, which often targets civilians and security forces.\nAuthorities say police and paramilitary forces are searching for the attackers.\nThe group committed multiple attacks in August that killed more than 50 people, while authorities responded by killing 21 insurgents in the province. Those killed included 23 passengers, mostly from eastern Punjab province, who were fatally shot after being taken from buses, vehicles and trucks in Musakhail district in Baluchistan.\nPrime Minister Shehbaz Sharif expressed his deep sorrow over the killings and vowed to eliminate terrorism.\nSarfraz Bugti, the chief minister in Balochistan said “terrorists have once again targeted poor laborers.\" He said the attackers were cruel and had an agenda to destabilize Pakistan. “The killing of these innocent laborers would be avenged,” he said in a statement.\nInterior Minister Mohsin Naqvi also said those who killed the laborers would not be able to escape from the grip of the law.\nThe province is home to several separatist groups who want independence. They accuse the federal government in Islamabad of unfairly exploiting oil- and mineral-rich Balochistan at the expense of locals.\nOn Monday, a group called the Baloch Liberation Army said it carried out an attack on Chinese nationals outside Pakistan's biggest airport. The bodies of the two slain Chinese engineers were sent to Beijing by a plane Thursday night, according to security officials.\nThere are thousands of Chinese working in the country, most of them involved in Beijing’s multibillion-dollar Belt and Road Initiative.\nThe explosion, which the BLA said was the work of a suicide bomber, also raised questions about the ability of Pakistani forces to protect high-profile events or foreigners in the country.\nIslamabad is hosting a summit next week of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, a grouping founded by China and Russia to counter Western alliances.\nAuthorities have beefed up security in the capital by deploying troops to prevent any acts of terrorism.\nThe Ministry of Interior this week alerted the country's four provinces to take additional measures to enhance security as the separatist groups and Pakistani Taliban could launch attacks at public places and government installations.\nThe killings of miners came hours after Saudi and Pakistani businessmen signed 27 memorandums of understanding valued at $2 billion for investment across various sectors, including mining in oil and gas-rich Balochistan. Pakistan’s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif attended the signing of the memorandums in the capital, Islamabad.\nSaudi Arabia also wants to invest in Reko Diq, district in Balochistan which famed for its mineral wealth, including gold and copper. Baluchistan’s Gwardar port is an anchor in the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, part of Beijing’s vast Belt and Road infrastructure initiative, and BLA has asked the Chinese to leave the province to avoid attacks.\nTags:\n#International\nKeywords:\nPakistan militants\nPakistan militants\nSHARE\nURL berhasil di salin."

In a recap of his recent meeting with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, Luhut said that the extension came up in the discussions.\n“Regarding the Jakarta-Surabaya high-speed train, we have agreed to form a team soon,” Luhut said on his official Instagram account over the weekend.\nThe Jakarta-Bandung high-speed railway, also known as Whoosh, has seen its ridership rising since it entered commercial operations in October 2023, and even soared in the recent Eid holiday, according to Luhut. The government estimates that hundreds of millions of Indonesians traveled during the long Eid holidays. The Eid break lasted for 10 days, lasting from April 6 to April 15. Whoosh reported that its ridership peaked on April 15, reaching approximately 21,500 passengers.&nbsp;\nAdvertisement\n“[Whoosh’s] ridership continues to grow since its launch, even during the peak of the Eid homecoming exodus.

According to Nusantara’s capital authority body, the railless tram&nbsp;will likely involve a Chinese firm. However, the body chose to keep the Chinese tech provider anonymous for the time being.\n“The [traditional] trams usually have rails, but this [automated rail transit] does not. It uses sensors and follows road markings. So it will not interfere with other modes of transportation,” Mohammed Ali Berawi, the deputy for digital and green transformation at the Nusantara authority body, told reporters in Jakarta on Friday.\n“We will work with a foreign technology provider.

Indonesia is also one of the beneficiary countries of Beijing’s colossal infrastructure project: the Belt and Road Initiative. Next year, as many as 204.8 million Indonesians will vote for the next president.\nThis raises the question of whether Indonesia-China ties will remain solid despite the change in presidencies. Questions also arise about whether foreign investors are in \"wait-and-see\" mode before making their investment&nbsp;as they wish to have a better picture of how Jokowi's successor plans on leading Indonesia.\nChinese Ambassador to Indonesia Lu Kang commented on the bilateral economic ties ahead of the presidential race. According to Lu Kang, the memoranda of understanding (MoU) related to Chinese investment in Indonesia have been on the rise. As long as development remains a focus, it is likely that Indonesia-China ties will remain robust.\nAdvertisement\n“We have already seen the enthusiasm from the Indonesian people about the benefits brought from the investment cooperation. Whatever the election’s election, the vast majority of Indonesians and statesmen have already seen that what is of utmost importance is a focus on development,” Lu Kang told B-Universe reporters on the sidelines of the 2023 China-Indonesia Media Forum in Jakarta on Wednesday.\n“If that does not change, I don't have any doubt in the prospect of the future and brighter prospects of the cooperation between China&nbsp;and Indonesia in trade, investment, and many other fronts,” Lu Kang said.\nBelt and Road Initiative\nThe Belt and Road Initiative -- Chinese President Xi Jinping’s brainchild – sees Beijing investing massively across the globe, spanning over 150 countries and more than 30 international organizations. One of the key Belt and Road Initiative projects is the $7.3 billion Jakarta-Bandung high-speed train, popularly known as Whoosh.&nbsp;\nThe Beijing-funded Whoosh project was constructed by the Kereta Cepat Indonesia-China (KCIC) consortium. China Development Bank’s loans covered 75 percent of the costs, while the remaining 25 percent of the financing came from the consortium’s own funds, the Associated Press reported.\n“Everybody today is excited about the Jakarta-Bandung, but that is just one of the projects of our cooperation. Commuting time has been shortened from 3.5 hours to 30 minutes. In the long run, this will create more points of economic growth along the line, maybe throughout Java or the country as a whole,” Lu Kang said.\nLu Kang also commented on the government’s plans to expand the high-speed train to Surabaya.&nbsp;\n“Whether [the project] will be extended to Surabaya or somewhere else, that is definitely up to the government and the people of Indonesia to make the decision. But whenever they make the decision, I personally get many of the Chinese corporations who will be interested in discussing with their partners in Indonesia,” Lu Kang said.\nGovernment data shows Chinese investment in Indonesia totaled $5.6 billion in January- September 2023. This made China Indonesia’s second-largest foreign investor after Singapore ($12.1 billion). Indonesia-China’s trade reached $133.6 billion in 2022.\nChief Investment Minister Luhut Binsar Pandjaitan said in June that the project could be expanded to Surabaya, and he had also talked to Lu Kang about extending the high-speed train. The minister said he had prepared a preliminary study on the expansion.\nThis year marks the 10th anniversary of the Belt and Road Initiative.\nTags:\n#Economy\nKeywords:\nBelt and Road Initiative\nLu Kang\nChinese Ambassador to Indonesia\nChinese Investment in Indonesia\n2024 Election\nSHARE\nURL berhasil di salin."

An example of China’s Belt and Road projects in Indonesia is the $7.3 billion Jakarta-Bandung high-speed railway.&nbsp;\nAside from bilateral talks with Xi, Jokowi will also meet Chinese Premier Li Qiang and the country’s top legislator Zhao Leji.\n“We will put forward several priority issues in our meeting with China, among others, on the increase of Indonesian exports, investments, as well as food security,” Jokowi told reporters at the Soekarno-Hatta International Airport shortly before his flight.\nAdvertisement\nTotal trade between Indonesia and China rose from almost $110 billion in 2021 to $133.6 billion the following year. Indonesian exports to China grew from $53.8 billion to $65.8 billion over the same period. Jakarta, however, posted a $1.9 billion deficit with China in 2022.&nbsp;\nChinese investments in Indonesia totaled $8.2 billion in 2022. This puts China as Indonesia’s second-largest foreign investor, ranking just behind Singapore ($13.3 billion).\nOn the food security front, ASEAN and China vowed to strengthen agricultural cooperation when the leaders gathered in Jakarta in September.&nbsp;Both sides agreed to deepen cooperation in agricultural supply chains, among others, by making full use of the existing free trade deals. Chinese Premier Li attended the ASEAN-China Summit.\nSaudi Arabia Visit\nJokowi will immediately head to the Saudi Arabian capital of Riyadh on Wednesday following his Beijing trip. He is set to co-chair the ASEAN-Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) Summit.&nbsp;\nThe GCC is a political and economic alliance made of&nbsp;the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Qatar, and Kuwait. Jokowi will also be meeting the Saudi Crown Prince and Prime Minister Mohammed bin Salman.\n“I will discuss the strengthening of economic and investment cooperation, halal products, energy security, and the establishment of a supreme coordinating council,” Jokowi said, commenting on his plans for the Riyadh visit.&nbsp;\nThe government reported that Indonesia-Saudi Arabia trade was on the rise. Indonesia posted $7.5 billion in bilateral trade with Saudi Arabia last year, up from $5.6 billion recorded in 2021. However, Jakarta’s trade deficit with Riyadh also widened from $2.4 billion (2021) to $3.5 billion (2022).

    "content": "Jakarta.\nPresident Joko “Jokowi” Widodo is scheduled to attend China's Belt and Road Forum next week, according to the Foreign Affairs Ministry spokesperson Lalu Muhammad Iqbal.\nChina will host its third Belt and Road Forum in Beijing on Oct. 17-18. The event marks one decade of the Belt and Road Initiative, in which China invests in the infrastructure development program across the globe. This colossal program has now stretched&nbsp;across over 150 countries, including Indonesia. Projects under this initiative include the recently launched&nbsp;$7.3 billion Jakarta-Bandung high-speed railway or Whoosh.\n“President [Jokowi] is confirmed to attend [the Belt and Road Forum],” Lalu told reporters in Jakarta on Friday.&nbsp;\n“To Indonesia, this forum is related to our domestic infrastructure development. We want to build the best possible infrastructure in the country, but that would not be possible without partnering with other stakeholders, be it at home or abroad,” Lalu said.\nAdvertisement\nAccording to Lalu, a bilateral meeting between Jokowi and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping is still under discussion. Jokowi is expected to bring some of his ministers and business delegates on his Beijing trip. However, Lalu did not say the names of the business delegates or ministers who would tag along with Jokowi.\nThe Beijing-funded Whoosh project was constructed by Kereta Cepat Indonesia-China (KCIC) consortium. China Development Bank’s loans covered 75 percent of the costs, while the remaining 25 percent of the financing came from the consortium’s own funds, the Associated Press reported.\nWhoosh also becomes Southeast Asia's first high-speed train.\nThe Jakarta-Bandung high-speed train Whoosh is parked at Padalarang Station on October 2, 2023.
