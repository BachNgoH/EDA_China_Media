As the green beam pierced the darkness, one could almost imagine it as an unorthodox holiday greeting, albeit one that could potentially blind our sailors.\nIncidents like these remind us of the challenges faced by our courageous men and women guarding the waters of the West Philippine Sea. Hasa-Hasa Shoal, a part of our exclusive economic zone (EEZ), isn\u2019t just a spot on the map\u2014it\u2019s a resource-rich area teeming with marine life, a haven for Filipino fishers, and a symbol of our national identity.\nWhile the laser incident might sound like a scene from a sci-fi movie, it\u2019s a stark reminder of the reality we face: a need to assert our sovereign rights without losing sight of diplomacy and peace. Let us not be intimidated by these bright displays; instead, let them serve as a spotlight on the pressing need for unity\u2014both domestically and internationally.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThe Philippines has always been a nation that values dialogue, justice, and mutual respect. We have demonstrated our commitment to these principles through the legal and diplomatic avenues we\u2019ve pursued, most notably the 2016 arbitral ruling that affirmed our rights in the West Philippine Sea.\nFEATURED STORIES\nOPINION\nUrgent action needed vs online piracy as Congress session nears end\nOPINION\nLife has shortened\nOPINION\nThe gift of second chances\nYet, these rights are not just about us. They resonate with all nations that believe in the rule of law and the importance of maintaining peace and stability in international waters. Our maritime zones are part of a larger network that supports global trade, biodiversity, and climate resilience. Protecting these waters is a shared responsibility.\nWe call on our friends in the international community to shine a light of their own on this issue. This is not merely a bilateral matter between the Philippines and China; it\u2019s a question of respecting international law and ensuring that no nation can claim what isn\u2019t theirs through coercion or force.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nFrom Asean partners to the broader global family, we urge you to amplify your voices. Support initiatives that uphold peace and the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (Unclos). Stand with us in asserting that the future of these waters lies in sustainable development, not conflict.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nTo our fellow Filipinos, let this serve as a rallying cry\u2014not to war, but to unwavering vigilance and unity. Every fisher who sails these waters, every soldier who guards our outposts, and every citizen who supports our claim, strengthens our stance. Together, we are a nation that believes in fairness, peace, and sovereignty.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nAnd to the unidentified vessel that brought a light show to Hasa-Hasa Shoal, let this be our message: the Philippines does not stand in darkness. We are guided by the light of our laws, our allies, and our indomitable spirit.\nSo, let us steer forward, navigating these contested waters with confidence.

Porcelain, silk and various spices made their way to the Philippines via the Manila Galleon trade starting at Quanzhou, a crucial hub in the ancient Maritime Silk Road.\nFEATURED STORIES\nBUSINESS\nMore foreign brands seen coming to PH shores in 2025\nBUSINESS\nGlobal Dominion: Simplifying financing to empower every Filipino\nBUSINESS\nInternational group kicks off infrastructure investment drive for PH\nPer a quick history from Wilson Flores, Federation of Filipino Chinese Chambers of Commerce and Industry, Inc. (FFCCCII) board member, the wave of Chinese migration, which began in the 19th century, was triggered by the \u201ccorrupt and bad governance of the late Qing Dynasty, combined with Western and Japanese colonial wars and Opium Wars, causing the once rich Chinese empire to suffer economically.\u201d\nLIVING FOSSIL Three Lanes and Seven Alleys in Fuzhuo was once a residential block where intellectuals, politicians and anyone of importance lived Photos by Ira Pedrasa.\nGeographical proximity lured a number of ethnic Chinese from Fujian to cross the seas and settle in the Philippines. Quoting the \u201cChristmas in Our Hearts\u201d singer, whose late father was sugar tycoon Antonio Chan, Flores says they were \u201cthe first overseas workers.\u201d\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nFlores, who acquired and restored the 85-year-old Kamuning Bakery, says his own forebears were from Fujian.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nElephant in the room\nAgainst this backdrop, the FFCCCII hosted a three-city familiarization trip in Fujian for a number of journalists that began in Xiamen early this month. Indeed, the conflict raging over the West Philippine Sea was not lost on anyone, including this author, but calmed by an almost familiar setting replete with Filipino culture and traditions\u2014that, perhaps, showcase that there are no distinctions to be set aside.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\n\u201cFujian people have been having business with the Philippines since more than a thousand years ago. They know our country and they have had intermarriages with our people, so that they are more comfortable with us,\u201d says George Chua Cham, FFCCCII government liaison committee chair, whose ancestors also hail from the China province.\n\u201cIt seems these controversial border disputes came about only in modern times, especially with the onset of colonialism. In the past, fisherfolk, traders and seafarers of all nations interacted with each other without passports, with the vast expanse of the sea actually uniting them in camaraderie, kinship and brotherhood,\u201d adds Flores.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nCROWNING GLORY A tiny shop near Kaiyuan Temple in Quanzhou offers traditional wear for rent, including this headpiece, to tourists. The belief is that when one wears a floral crown, called Zanhuawei, \u201cin this life, you\u2019ll also be pretty in the afterlife.\u201d\nFrom Xiamen airport, a mall with an all-too-familiar logo of the SM group greets guests upon their entry into the city. Manicured gardens and parks are found in every corner, as a major highway provides unobstructed view of the sea, a la Manila Bay.\nIn early December, temperature usually drops to the mid-teens\u2014just the right formula for a long walk for those accustomed to the tropics. Around the same time this year, Beijing had to endure its longest cold wave in modern history.\nAccording to Fujian officials interviewed, aside from the weather, Filipinos will take a liking to the connectivity that the city and the province, in general, have to offer.\nInterprovince, a bullet train will cut by more than half passengers\u2019 travel time to Fuzhou, the provincial capital, to just over an hour. The CR Fuxing is only the third fastest train in the world, with the first two also belonging to China.\nTHIRD FASTEST TRAIN At a speed of 350 kilometers per hour, the CR Fuxing is just the third fastest in the world. The first and second spots also belong to China.\nRunning at a speed of 350 kilometers per hour, a seat by the window gives a spectacular\u2014at times dizzying\u2014alternate views of the sea, tree-lined mountains and buildings of various shapes and sizes. It\u2019s a showcase of how the Fujian government would describe its advantage over the more popular cities of China: the province offers \u201cmarine culture, ecological civilization and multiculturalism.\u201dA crisscross of modern and ancient\nAside from the rich cuisine\u2014think oyster omelette, spring rolls, fish balls and an array of soup varieties (including \u2018Buddha Jumps Over the Wall,\u2019 a collagen-filled soup of abalone, sea cucumber and various meats so-called because even Buddha would be tempted to splurge on it)\u2014on offer, Fujian also provides an ancient vibe that can easily comingle with the modern.\nSanFangQiXiang, or the Three Lanes and Seven Alleys in Fuzhou, is an Instagram-ready residential block regarded by scholars as a \u201cliving fossil of ancient city street system.\u201d Once an area that housed intellectuals and officials of important standing in the Ming and Qing dynasties, it is now a major tourist spot with a side street offering various curios and food.\nA stone\u2019s throw away is Lin Zexu Memorial, a mix of temple and museum in remembrance of China\u2019s anti-opium hero, whose policies precipitated the Opium War and continued to inspire modern China\u2019s endeavors in the narcotics war.\nNOT TIRESOME One of two five-story pagodas that flank Kai- yuan Temple in Quanzhou, a crucial port on the ancient Mari- time Silk Road, where various beliefs and religions flourished.\nA consistent theme in China\u2019s history is perhaps the pride that its peoples have grown to evolve with in response to subjugation and humiliation over the centuries.\nNot only in Fujian, Luckin outlets are now scattered across China. It was the country\u2019s response to the dominance of Starbucks, which currently numbers around 6,000 versus the homegrown coffee brand\u2019s 10,000 branches.\nIn Quanzhou, which is two hours by bus from Fuzhou, a museum houses the 32-year-old history of Anta, the country\u2019s biggest sportswear company and the world\u2019s third largest in terms of market capitalization (next only to Nike and Adidas). Founded in Fujian, Anta has gained popularity in recent years after signing up big names in world sports while tapping a burgeoning predilection among the young for anything homegrown rooted in national pride.\nPH hero in China\n\u201cMulticulturalism\u201d is another big theme in Fujian\u2019s tourism banner.\nNOT LUNETA The tallest Rizal monument, at 18.61 meters representing the Philippine hero\u2019s birth year, can be found in Jinjiang, Quanzhou.\nWhere else is this most reflected than in Quanzhou, one of the most important ports in the Maritime Silk Road, a sea route that modern China wants to revisit through its Belt and Road Initiative.\nWowing the likes of explorers Marco Polo and Ibn Battuta, Quanzhou was an important trading hub that allowed various religions and beliefs to flourish.\nEven FFCCCII\u2019s Cham could only quip they had no concept of racism and discrimination in those days. A tombstone unearthed in recent years showed Buddha with angel wings and a mix of other religious elements, such as Hinduism surrounding it. Meanwhile, in the middle of the city is a 1,000-year-old mosque built for Muslim traders and not far from it is the Taoist temple, Guandi.\nFilipinos will also do a double take when they visit Rizal Park in Zhangguo village also in Quanzhou for its similarities to the one in Manila. The Fujian monument commemorates the Philippine hero while acknowledging his Chinese connection. Rizal\u2019s great-grandfather was Domingo Lam-co (Chinese name: Ke Yinan) who adopted the surname Mercado.\nA case for Mandarin\nBack in Fuzhou, about 50 Filipino students and teachers are studying Mandarin at 116-year-old Fujian Normal University. Some have been living in China for a couple of years now and are supported by the FFCCCII.\nLindsey Reyes, who hails from Bataan, believes studying the language will be a big advantage when she graduates. \u201cKnowing a foreign language is an advantage, what more if it\u2019s Mandarin?\u201dReyes and her companions say the language will make Filipinos more competitive in an increasingly globalized world. Knowledge of the language also becomes an imperative with China\u2019s growing impact across economies.\nIn the Philippines, teachers who can teach Mandarin are few and far between. While a campaign for the inclusion of Mandarin in the curriculum has yet to take root, students like Reyes will have to content themselves with scholarships that will allow them to \u201cgive back\u201d to their mother country in the near future.\nAdjusting in a foreign country like China was not difficult for Christian Dayson of Pampanga. He was more surprised that all his perceptions of China were shattered when he started studying there.\n\u201cTheir personalities are not that different from Pinoys. Like us, they are very much willing when we need help,\u201d he says.\nAs run-ins on disputed waters continue, so too must trade and cultural exchanges, according to Cham. Fujian today also remains a commercial center of trade for Filipino products such as durian, banana chips and other agricultural products.\nBased on data from the Fujian government, exports to the Philippines grew 16 percent in 2021 to $10.43 billion, while imports increased almost 41 percent to $1.2 billion in the same year.\nTRAFFIC-FREE Xiamen\u2019s roads are free of heavy traffic even at peak hours due to pedestrian-friendly sidewalks and e-bikes scattered all over the city, ready for renting using e-wallets.\nFFCCCII president Cecilio Pedro says it\u2019s high time for a \u201creset\u201d in Philippine-China relations in the direction of \u201cmore cooperation and dialogues.\u201d\nIn a follow-up email correspondence with the Inquirer, the Fujian government says the dispute at sea is \u201crooted in the intersection of history, law and geopolitics, and there is currently no universally accepted solution.\u201d\nYour subscription could not be saved.

        "content": "Who\u2019s more valuable to Southeast Asia: its immediate neighbor China, or the other superpower across the Pacific, the United States?\nThere\u2019s an undeniable rivalry between the two in their multifaceted relations with the region, and for good reason. The Switzerland-based World Economic Forum describes Asean\u2014the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations\u2014as the world\u2019s \u201ceconomic dark horse.\u201d Its combined population of 685 million makes it the third-largest market in the world, next to India and China. It thus wields demographic power and is now acknowledged as a driver of the global economy.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThe Asean countries share a common geography and ethnicities, but the economic disparities among them are wide. Average income in the richest member Singapore ($91,100 in 2023) is 77 times that in the poorest member Myanmar ($1,180). Price stability ranges from very stable (with Brunei\u2019s and Thailand\u2019s annual inflation rates of 0.4 and 1.2 percent, respectively) to hyperinflationary (Laos with 31.2 and Myanmar with 27.1 percent). The jobs situation ranges from virtual full employment in Cambodia and Thailand, with unemployment rates of 0.5 and 1.0 percent this year, to Indonesia\u2019s 5.3 percent. Exports-to-GDP ratio ranges from dynamic Singapore\u2019s 108.9 percent to inward-looking Philippines\u2019 measly 12.7 percent (regional average is 55.9 percent). Education outcomes range from globally top-ranked Singapore to bottom-dwellers Philippines and Cambodia (77th and 81st, respectively) in the 2022 Programme for International Student Assessment or Pisa. With such wide disparities, it would be ideal if the US and China help the region with a \u201crising tide that lifts all boats\u201d so that the wide inequalities both across and within countries in Asean could somehow be narrowed.\nFEATURED STORIES\nOPINION\nUrgent action needed vs online piracy as Congress session nears end\nOPINION\nLife has shortened\nOPINION\nThe gift of second chances\nI was invited last week to a candid dialogue in Thailand on how China and the US are helping Southeast Asia. My assigned focus was on their economic contributions to the region. These come via trade, investment, economic assistance, tourism, labor migration, and more. I focused on the first three, which are the most prominent elements in the relationship, and for which data are readily available.\nChina is Asean\u2019s largest trading partner, which is not surprising being right next door. Even so, the US actually took the lead from China early this year as the biggest buyer of Asean\u2019s exports, even from the other side of the world. Trade balance with the US has consistently been in Asean\u2019s favor, with a $200-billion trade surplus; that is, Asean sells more to the US than it buys from it, by that much. The reverse is true with China, which sells more to Asean than it buys, by about $100 billion, and this Asean trade deficit with China has grown tenfold since 2010, in an increasingly lopsided trade.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nAs to foreign direct investments, the US is Asean\u2019s largest source, with $74.4 billion in FDI inflows in 2023. China comes in fourth with FDI flows of $17.3 billion, behind the European Union\u2019s $24.9 billion and Asean cross-investments of $21.9 billion. American investments have been shifting to Asean since the US-China trade war and the COVID-19 pandemic led American manufacturers in China to shift out or add back-up factories in Asean, to the great benefit of the region.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nChina\u2019s economic assistance comes mainly as soft loans for large infrastructure projects under the Belt and Road Initiative. In 2021, it pivoted to a Global Development Initiative promoting \u201cpeople-centered, high-quality, green, and innovation-driven development.\u201d The US Agency for International Development delivers a smaller but comprehensive package of grant assistance covering a wide range of areas including governance, education, health care, agriculture, manufacturing, renewable energy, digital economy, trade facilitation, and workforce development\u2014all aimed to support economic growth, poverty reduction, and sustainable development in Asean. US grants and soft loans uphold labor and environmental standards, transparency, accountability, and human rights, which some see as intrusive conditionalities. While Chinese soft loan projects have no such \u201cstrings\u201d attached, they provoke concerns about a lack of labor and environmental safeguards, looming \u201cdebt traps,\u201d and the prospect of giving up state assets in the event of default. Their assistance with connectivity infrastructure is also feared to carry the risk of data security, cyber-espionage, and over-dependence.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThere are pros and cons on each side. But rather than see it as a contest for the region, the dialogue agreed that complementation or even cooperation, rather than competition, would be in the best interest of Southeast Asia, and in turn, the world. However, current geopolitical realities make this little more than wishful thinking.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\ncielito.habito@gmail.com\nYour subscription could not be saved.

As the green beam pierced the darkness, one could almost imagine it as an unorthodox holiday greeting, albeit one that could potentially blind our sailors.\nIncidents like these remind us of the challenges faced by our courageous men and women guarding the waters of the West Philippine Sea. Hasa-Hasa Shoal, a part of our exclusive economic zone (EEZ), isn\u2019t just a spot on the map\u2014it\u2019s a resource-rich area teeming with marine life, a haven for Filipino fishers, and a symbol of our national identity.\nWhile the laser incident might sound like a scene from a sci-fi movie, it\u2019s a stark reminder of the reality we face: a need to assert our sovereign rights without losing sight of diplomacy and peace. Let us not be intimidated by these bright displays; instead, let them serve as a spotlight on the pressing need for unity\u2014both domestically and internationally.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThe Philippines has always been a nation that values dialogue, justice, and mutual respect.

Our maritime zones are part of a larger network that supports global trade, biodiversity, and climate resilience. Protecting these waters is a shared responsibility.\nWe call on our friends in the international community to shine a light of their own on this issue. This is not merely a bilateral matter between the Philippines and China; it\u2019s a question of respecting international law and ensuring that no nation can claim what isn\u2019t theirs through coercion or force.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nFrom Asean partners to the broader global family, we urge you to amplify your voices.

Every fisher who sails these waters, every soldier who guards our outposts, and every citizen who supports our claim, strengthens our stance. Together, we are a nation that believes in fairness, peace, and sovereignty.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nAnd to the unidentified vessel that brought a light show to Hasa-Hasa Shoal, let this be our message: the Philippines does not stand in darkness.

As the green beam pierced the darkness, one could almost imagine it as an unorthodox holiday greeting, albeit one that could potentially blind our sailors.\nIncidents like these remind us of the challenges faced by our courageous men and women guarding the waters of the West Philippine Sea. Hasa-Hasa Shoal, a part of our exclusive economic zone (EEZ), isn\u2019t just a spot on the map\u2014it\u2019s a resource-rich area teeming with marine life, a haven for Filipino fishers, and a symbol of our national identity.\nWhile the laser incident might sound like a scene from a sci-fi movie, it\u2019s a stark reminder of the reality we face: a need to assert our sovereign rights without losing sight of diplomacy and peace. Let us not be intimidated by these bright displays; instead, let them serve as a spotlight on the pressing need for unity\u2014both domestically and internationally.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThe Philippines has always been a nation that values dialogue, justice, and mutual respect.

Our maritime zones are part of a larger network that supports global trade, biodiversity, and climate resilience. Protecting these waters is a shared responsibility.\nWe call on our friends in the international community to shine a light of their own on this issue. This is not merely a bilateral matter between the Philippines and China; it\u2019s a question of respecting international law and ensuring that no nation can claim what isn\u2019t theirs through coercion or force.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nFrom Asean partners to the broader global family, we urge you to amplify your voices. Support initiatives that uphold peace and the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (Unclos). Stand with us in asserting that the future of these waters lies in sustainable development, not conflict.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nTo our fellow Filipinos, let this serve as a rallying cry\u2014not to war, but to unwavering vigilance and unity. Every fisher who sails these waters, every soldier who guards our outposts, and every citizen who supports our claim, strengthens our stance. Together, we are a nation that believes in fairness, peace, and sovereignty.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nAnd to the unidentified vessel that brought a light show to Hasa-Hasa Shoal, let this be our message: the Philippines does not stand in darkness.

        "content": "Indonesia\u2014Since their invention in the early 20th century, plastics have been omnipresent in our daily life, and have become a global choice due to their durability, flexibility, and low production cost. Industries ranging from food to electronics have been relying for decades on plastics, their primary material for product packaging. Plastic serves as protection, marketing and information tool, and a convenient way to transport products. For optimal performance, plastic is often combined with other materials, making it difficult to recycle.\nDespite the ample benefits, plastic\u2019s versatility may pose risks to health and the environment. Since the 1950s, plastic consumption has surged, reaching 400.3 million tons in global production in 2022 alone, much of them for single-use packaging to preserve food and protect fragile items.\nBut environmental alarms are sounding. Researcher Hannah Ritchie and colleagues estimate that 0.5 percent of plastics end up in the ocean, harming marine ecosystems. Traces of plastic also pollute mountains, forests, and waterways.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nTo deal with the problem, businesses and governments have been showing a stronger commitment. The fifth Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee (INC-5) on Plastic Pollution from Nov. 25 to Dec. 1 in Busan, South Korea, was meant to draft an international legally binding instrument to tackle the plastic pollution problem.\nFEATURED STORIES\nOPINION\nUrgent action needed vs online piracy as Congress session nears end\nOPINION\nLife has shortened\nOPINION\nThe gift of second chances\nThe momentum is building as over 260 businesses, from multinationals to local enterprises, have joined the Business Coalition for a Global Plastics Treaty (BCGPT), urging governments at INC-5 to adopt an ambitious, full-lifecycle plastics treaty. This collective effort also aims to foster awareness, innovation, and a sustainable ecosystem with the prospect of global regulations under a treaty.\nIndustry has also been exploring solutions like optimizing and harmonizing packaging (Reduce), reusable packaging, and design for recycling. It has also been increasing recycled content along with developing bioplastics and paper-based options to reduce virgin plastic use. These innovations require comprehensive life cycle assessments and suitable waste management for bio-based plastics to ensure sustainable impact.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nAs well, food and beverage packaging must meet strict safety and compliance standards to protect consumers. Key guidelines include Food and Drug Monitoring Agency Regulation No. 20/2019, and international standards like those from the United States Food and Drug Administration, the European Medicines Agency, and the European Food Safety Authority, detailing permitted, limited, and banned substances. Additionally, packaging should be environmentally safe, functional, competitively priced, and of high quality.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nLeading producers of fast-moving consumer goods have also optimized packaging size, increased recycled content and used easier-to-recycle materials. They\u2019ve introduced reusable designs and innovations as well, like paper straws.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nBut are these alternatives enough to address the plastic crisis?\nRecycling is important, but not enough. In fact, less than 10 percent of plastic waste is currently recycled globally. The remaining waste often ends up being incinerated in landfills.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThen there\u2019s the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) program, which requires companies to manage their products\u2019 end-of-life, which is now gaining traction, especially in developed countries with advanced waste management. However, for EPR to be effective globally, stronger waste management systems are essential, particularly in developing countries where they remain inadequate and poorly managed, leading to high rates of plastic leakage into rivers and oceans.\nI\u2019d strongly suggest maximizing our efforts for waste collection, waste segregation, and building the infrastructure to process related waste. We must ensure greater quantity and better quality feedstock for secondary raw materials to increase the recycling rate and recycled content. For packaging, we can work on nonfood contact material if the food contact material is not yet available.\nWe also need stricter but more conducive regulations to prevent plastic leakage and to promote and encourage the use of sustainable materials, given the higher costs incurred when industry switches to easy-to-recycle materials or to recycled-content materials. Waste management systems should not create new problems, such as improper disposal of hazardous byproducts.\nThe plastic crisis requires multiple solutions. Global rules can unify multi-stakeholder efforts to phase out problematic plastics, but consumer behavior change is also essential. Now is the time to advocate for stronger regulations, better waste management, and a collective shift in consumption and production. Plastics were considered a \u201cmiracle\u201d when they were first introduced for packaging. They now pose challenges and are perceived as a symbol of unsustainability.\nIt is time to rethink our relationship with plastics for the sake of the planet. The Jakarta Post/Asia News Network\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\nPutut Pramono is the education and sustainability director of Indonesian Packaging Federation.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\nYour subscription could not be saved.

The opposition claims to have collected records from more than 80 percent of the 30,000 polling booths nationwide showing it won.\nMaduro announced Saturday that the government has arrested 2,000 opponents and at a rally in Caracas he pledged to detain more people and send them to prison. The post-electoral uprising has also claimed at least 11 deaths, according to Foro Penal, a Caracas-based human rights group.\nThe Venezuela-based human rights organization Provea, in a report issued Monday analyzing the post-election climate, concluded that the government\u2019s response to silence people\u2019s discontent has been \u201cthrough the disproportionate use of force\u201d that has resulted in the deaths of protesters, \u201cthe open coordinated action between security forces and groups of armed civilians in favor of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro to calm the protests, and the exponential increase in arbitrary arrests.\u201d\nREAD:\nLeaders worldwide express concern over increasing arrests in Venezuela\nThe organization reported that based on figures announced by the Attorney General\u2019s Office last week, the number of arrests against real or perceived government opponents is equivalent to about 42 percent \u201cof the total number of arbitrary arrests recorded by Provea between April and August 2017, the most important cycle of protests in the country since 1989.\u201d\nGonz\u00e1lez and Machado in their missive called on Venezuelans with family members serving in the security forces to urge their loved ones not to attack protesters and obey illegal orders. It said it would offer \u201cguarantees\u201d to soldiers who follow the constitution even while promising there would be no impunity for those behind abuses and following illegal orders.\nBoth Gonz\u00e1lez, a former diplomat, and Machado \u2014 who was barred by the government from running \u2014 have gone into hiding, saying they fear they will be arrested or killed.
