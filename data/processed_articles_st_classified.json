        "content": "ROME  -     Italy has officially informed China that it is quitting the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), dismissing fears the move might sour relations and damage the Italian economy, government sources said on Wednesday.\nItaly in 2019 became the first and so far only major Western nation to join the trade and investment programme, ignoring warnings from the United States that it might let China take control of sensitive technologies and vital infrastructure.\nHowever, when Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni took office last year, she said she wanted to withdraw from the deal, which was championed by President Xi Jinping, saying it had brought no significant gains to Italy.\nThe 2019 accord expires in March 2024 and an Italian government source said Rome had sent Beijing a letter \"in recent days\" informing China that it would not be renewing the pact.\nThere was no immediate comment from China.\n\"We have every intention of maintaining excellent relations with China even if we are no longer part of the Belt and Road Initiative,\" a second government source said.\n\"Other G7 nations have closer relations with China than we do, despite the fact they were never in (the BRI),\" he added.\nST Asian Insider: Malaysia Edition\nGet exclusive insights into Malaysia in weekly round-up\nThank you!\nSign up\nBy signing up, I accept SPH Media's\nTerms &amp; Conditions\nand\nPrivacy Policy\nas amended from time to time.\nYes, I would also like to receive SPH Media Group's\nSPH Media Limited, its related corporations and affiliates as well as their agents and authorised service providers.\nmarketing and promotions.\nItaly will assume the presidency of the G7 in 2024.\nMore than 100 countries have signed agreements with China to cooperate on BRI infrastructure and building projects since the scheme was launched in 2013. The then Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte hoped for a trade bonanza when he signed up in 2019, but Chinese firms seemed to be the main beneficiaries.\nItalian exports to China totalled 16.4 billion euros ($17.7 billion) last year from 13 billion euros in 2019. By contrast, Chinese exports to Italy rose to 57.5 billion from 31.7 billion over the same period, according to Italian data.\nItaly's main euro zone trading partners France and Germany exported significantly more to China last year, despite not being part of the BRI, which is modelled on the old Silk Road that linked China to the West.\nLooking to maintain strategic ties, Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani visited Beijing in September and President Sergio Mattarella is due to visit China at some stage next year.\nMeloni herself has said she wants to go to Beijing, but no date has been fixed.\nDespite being part of the BRI, successive governments in Rome signalled their doubts about the pact by vetoing some proposed takeovers or limiting the sway of Chinese companies over their Italian counterparts.\nIn June, Meloni's cabinet curbed the influence of Chinese shareholder Sinochem on Italian tyremaker Pirelli, using \"golden power\" rules designed to protect strategic assets.\nMeloni, who heads a conservative coalition, has been keen to burnish her credentials as a committed pro-NATO leader and a government source said that she had assured U.S. President Joe Biden earlier this year that Italy would quit the BRI.

        "content": "SINGAPORE \u2013\nOpera buffs can look forward to an unusual double bill of Giacomo Puccini\u2019s Gianni Schicchi and a light-hearted Chinese work, A Story Of Growing Up, at Singtel Waterfront Theatre on Dec 8 and 9.\nThe shows are presented by the China National Centre for the&nbsp;Performing Arts (NCPA) and the Asean-China Centre in&nbsp;collaboration with the Singapore Metropolitan Festival Orchestra, under the baton of Singapore Cultural Medallion recipient Yeh Tsung.&nbsp;\nThe productions mark the 10th&nbsp;anniversary of the Belt and Road initiative. The Chinese government introduced this global infrastructure development scheme in 2013 to invest in countries and international organisations.\nMs Iris Lanfen Wei, director of the NCPA\u2019s department of production and artistic administration, tells The Straits Times: \u201cNCPA has always emphasised both Chinese original creations and world classics in its repertoire production.\n\u201cOn the one hand, it develops and promotes Chinese culture, especially traditional culture. On the other hand, it also actively introduces world classics.\u201d\nGianni Schicchi is the only opera buffa composed by opera&nbsp;master Puccini.&nbsp;\nThe comic opera in one act, about a witty fight for a family\u2019s fortune, was an immediate hit when it was first performed&nbsp;at New York\u2019s Metropolitan Opera&nbsp;in December 1918.&nbsp;\nIt garnered rave reviews&nbsp;and the score has been praised for its creativity and imagination.&nbsp;The aria,&nbsp;O Mio Babbino Caro (\u201cO My Dear Daddy\u201d), is one of the most famous lyric soprano arias in opera.&nbsp;\nNCPA first performed the work&nbsp;in China in 2021, following its productions of other famous works such as Turandot, Tosca and La Fanciulla del West by the same composer.&nbsp;\nA Story Of Growing Up is based on a 1956 fairy tale by Ren Rongrong, a famous Chinese&nbsp;translator and writer of children\u2019s literature.\nThe production with bright and breezy music tells the story of two boys with bad habits \u2013&nbsp;Meitounao (\u201cFool\u201d) and Bugaoxing (\u201cUnhappy\u201d). After&nbsp;a dreamlike trip through time, they finally understand that their foibles could result in terrible mistakes.\nThough different in culture and background, both shows&nbsp;are full of humour and vitality.\nThe NCPA, inaugurated in December 2007, is a state-level art institution in Beijing whose facilities include an opera house, a concert hall, a theatre and an art museum.&nbsp;\nSince NCPA produced its first opera Turandot in 2008, it has put on more than 100 productions, covering opera, drama, dance drama, Peking opera and other\ngenres.&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\nMs Wei says of the double-bill programme for Singapore: \u201cWith his distinctive personal style and highly mature opera-writing techniques, Puccini presented a portrait of Italian society.&nbsp;As for the children\u2019s opera,&nbsp;A Story\nOf\nGrowing Up, it has not only become a classic in the history of children\u2019s literature, but also a common childhood memory for generations.\n\u201cWe hope that these two representative works can leave a deep impression on Singaporean audiences.\u201d\nMaestro\nYeh\n, who is also Singapore Chinese Orchestra\u2019s conductor emeritus, says: \u201cThough these two operas are shorter in length and lighter in style, they show important aspects of human nature with a good sense of humour.\u201d &nbsp;\nA Story Of Growing Up is a lively and witty production adapted from a fairy tale of the same title.\nPHOTO: CHINA NATIONAL CENTRE FOR THE PERFORMING ARTS\nBook It/Puccini Opera Gianni Schicchi\nWhere:\n&nbsp;Singtel Waterfront Theatre\n,&nbsp;Esplanade \u2013 Theatres on the Bay, 8 Raffles Avenue\nWhen:\nDec 8, 7.30pm\nAdmission:\n$58, $78\nInfo:\nThe performance\nis in Italian, with surtitles in English and Chinese.

Moscow says this does not mean a military alliance, however.\nShared outlook\nBoth leaders share a broad world view, which sees the West as decadent and in decline just as China challenges US supremacy in everything from technology to espionage and military power.\nTrade between Russia and China soared 30 per cent in the first half of this year and will rise to more than US$200 billion (S$272 billion) in 2023, Russian Economy Minister Maxim Reshetnikov said on a visit to China.\n\u201cWe are actively developing investments, including in our large gas and petrochemical projects, where we actively use Chinese technologies,\u201d Mr Reshetnikov said.\n\u201cWe are strongly interested in transforming technological cooperation into investment cooperation, so that Chinese companies actively enter into these projects, invest in capital, and lend money, because the projects are capital-intensive and not all of them can be fully provided for by the Russian financial system.\u201d\nThe United States sees China as its gravest long-term \u201cstrategic competitor\u201d and Russia as an \u201cacute threat\u201d.\nChina has refrained from condemning Russia\u2019s operation against Ukraine or calling it an invasion, in line with the Kremlin, which casts the war as a \u201cspecial military operation\u201d.\nEarlier this year, CIA Director William Burns said Russia was becoming more and more dependent on China and was even at risk of becoming its \u201ceconomic colony\u201d in time.

        "content": "BEIJING\n-\nChina on Tuesday unveiled its blueprint for a better world, raised by President Xi Jinping in 2013, through a policy paper on building a global community of shared future.\nBeijing also said it will continue to push for\ngreen development in Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) projects,\nrejecting claims that it has outsourced its environmental pollution,\na senior official from the country\u2019s top economic planner\nsaid at a press conference on the wide-ranging policy paper about China\u2019s global vision.\nThe White Paper titled \u201cA Global Community of Shared Future: China\u2019s Proposals and Actions\u201d comes a decade after the vision was first proposed by Mr Xi, and has been presented as his alternative to the current Western-led world order, with an emphasis on what it calls Chinese-style diplomacy and various global initiatives.\nThis year\nalso\nmarks the 10th anniversary of the BRI, and China will host the third Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation&nbsp;in\nOctober\n, with leaders and representatives from some 130 countries set to attend,\nincluding Russian President Vladimir Putin.\nBy July 2023, more than three-quarters of countries in the world and over 30 international organisations had signed agreements on Belt and Road cooperation with China, the White Paper said.\nIssued by the State Council Information Office, the White Paper said the vision rises above the exclusive rules of bloc politics, the notion of \u201cmight makes right\u201d and the \u201cuniversal values\u201d defined by a handful of Western countries.&nbsp;\nChina has contributed to building a global community of shared future with actions including promoting high-quality Belt and Road cooperation, state news agency Xinhua said on Tuesday.&nbsp;\nST Asian Insider: Malaysia Edition\nGet exclusive insights into Malaysia in weekly round-up\nThank you!\nSign up\nBy signing up, I accept SPH Media's\nTerms &amp; Conditions\nand\nPrivacy Policy\nas amended from time to time.\nYes, I would also like to receive SPH Media Group's\nSPH Media Limited, its related corporations and affiliates as well as their agents and authorised service providers.\nmarketing and promotions.\nAt the press conference, in a rare appearance beyond his usual annual press conference in March, Foreign Minister Wang Yi said that by putting forward the creative idea, President Xi has shown \u201cthe correct path for the world\u201d, building a strong consensus for international cooperation.\nChina has also proposed solutions to major global challenges in fields such as health, climate change and cyber security, Mr Wang added.&nbsp;\nHe said Beijing was willing to play a \u201cconstructive\u201d role in the success of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) summit in November in San Francisco.\nIt paves the way for a possible meeting between Mr Xi and US President Joe Biden \u2013 both presidents last met on the sidelines of the Group of 20 (G-20) leaders\u2019 summit&nbsp;in November\n2022\nin Bali.\nMr Xi did not attend the G-20 summit in India earlier in September, missing an opportunity to meet Mr Biden, and prompting the US to say China was \u201cgiving up\u201d on the G-20 and building an alternative world order.\n\u201cOf course, we and all parties also hope that the United States will realise its responsibilities as a host, show due openness, fairness, tolerance and responsibility, and create better conditions for the smooth holding of the meeting,\u201d Mr Wang said, referring to the Apec summit.\nMore on this Topic\nChina Vice-President says country committed to opening itself wider to the world\nChina\u2019s foreign policy is viewed negatively, but its investments are welcome: Pew report\nEarlier on Tuesday, Hong Kong Chief Executive John Lee said he had\nyet to receive any invitation to the November meeting.\nIt follows US media reports in July that he had been barred from the meetings after being sanctioned by Washington for what it calls his role in cracking down on civil liberties in the Asian financial hub.\nMr Wang repeated a frequent Chinese warning that China opposes \u201cwanton expansion of military alliances\u201d and the squeezing of the security space of other countries.\nBeijing has been critical of Washington\u2019s continued attempts to increase military cooperation in the Indo-Pacific region, including the Quad and the Aukus groupings. It particularly disagrees with bases that are being built by the US in the north of the Philippines.\nDialogue between China and the US has been gradually resuming despite continued tensions, with several high-level\nvisits to Beijing in recent months by top US officials,\nincluding Secretary of State Antony Blinken,\nTreasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo.\nMeanwhile, not all is rosy with China\u2019s BRI, which has been criticised for causing environmental destruction in project areas, including building coal-fired power plants overseas despite a national commitment domestically to reach peak carbon output by 2030, and to be carbon-neutral by 2060.\nEarlier in 2023, a report in The Jakarta Post said the Batang Toru hydropower project, which is 70 per cent owned by Chinese-owned State Development and Investment Corporation\u2019s subsidiary SDIC Power, had encroached on the habitat of the endangered Tapanuli orangutan, forcing them to intrude on nearby farms and villages.\n\u201cThe joint construction of the \u2018Belt and Road\u2019 projects is carried out based on\nthe principle of\nextensive consultation, joint construction and shared benefits,\u201d Mr Cong Liang, deputy director of the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), said in response to a question from The Straits Times at the press conference.\n\u201cWhether the development is green or not, I think the (partner country) knows best, the local people have the most say, and facts are always more convincing than words.\u201d\nMore on this Topic\nAs America\u2019s influence in Asia wanes, Asian economies are integrating\nChinese-funded railways bring tourists to SE Asia, but they also cause tensions\nIt is \u201cnot worth refuting\u201d the voices that slander the Green Silk Road \u2013 an initiative to make BRI projects more ecologically sustainable \u2013 and those who attempt to smear and interfere with joint projects will not succeed, he added.\nTouting the BRI\u2019s success, officials said projects such as the high-speed rail between Jakarta and Bandung, the Phnom Penh-Sihanoukville Expressway, and the Greek port of Piraeus have increased connectivity, rejuvenating the local economies with jobs and trade.\n\u201cIn the next step, the NDRC will work with relevant departments\u2026 (and) continue to build high-quality landmark projects, promote \u2018small but beautiful\u2019 projects, deepen cooperation in key areas such as infrastructure and people\u2019s livelihood projects to achieve complementary advantages, mutual benefits and win-win results,\u201d Mr Cong&nbsp;said.\nAlready a subscriber?&nbsp;\nLog in\nOur 12.12 Sale is here!\nStay informed with ST One Digital at $0.99/month for the first 6 months\nST One Digital Plan\n$9.90/month\n&nbsp;\n$0.99/month\nNo contract\nBilled at $0.99/month for the first 6 months, $9.90/month thereafter.

Big improvers India were thrilled to finish fourth with a national record 28 golds, and smashed their target of 100 medals overall.\nBreakdancers competed at the Games for the first time in a preview of the discipline's Paris Olympic debut.\nEsports' debut as a medal event proved a hit. Local fans  flocked to see star South Korean gamer Lee Sang-hyeok, better known as \"Faker\", in the \"League of Legends\" category.\nRested from the final, Lee joined his teammates in winning gold and a coveted exemption from South Korea's compulsory military service.\nParis St Germain midfielder Lee Kang-in can also skip military service, with South Korea beating Japan 2-1 in the men's soccer final.\nQatari high jump great Mutaz Barshim cruised to a third Asian Games gold, but the athletics was marred by controversy and official blunders.\nAn official suffered a broken leg and serious bleeding after being hit by a misthrown hammer.\nOlympic and world champion Neeraj Chopra won the javelin but had to re-take his first effort after a long and confusing hiatus, with officials having failed to record his mark.\nThe women's 100m hurdles descended into farce when China's Wu Yanni had a clear false start only for officials to disqualify Indian rival Jyothi Yarraji.\nEventual silver medallist Yarraji, who was a step behind Wu, protested and officials corrected their decision, but Wu was allowed to run under protest before finally being disqualified.\nThe men's kabaddi final between India and Iran was halted for an hour over an officiating dispute that saw both teams stage sit-down protests.\nAfghanistan, however, had no recourse when their men's cricket final against India was abandoned because of rain.\nWith no spare day allocated for the weather and no provision to share the medal, India were awarded the gold purely by virtue of their higher world ranking.\nNorth Korea were sore losers after falling 2-1 to Japan in the men's soccer quarter-finals. Security staff intervened after several of their players mobbed and manhandled the referee on field after the match ended.\nThe Games' drug testers reported seven athletes had been banned for positive tests, including a Turkmenistan athlete who took silver in kurash, the central Asian wrestling event.\nBacked by the OCA and the IOC, women represented Afghanistan in cycling, volleyball and athletics, in defiance of the Taliban, which has halted women's sport in the country.\n\"Nowadays, they are looking for hope,\" said Afghan volleyballer Mursal Khedri of women athletes in the nation. \"By seeing us here they can find hope.\"\nREUTERS\nAlready a subscriber?&nbsp;\nLog in\nOur 12.12 Sale is here!\nStay informed with ST One Digital at $0.99/month for the first 6 months\nST One Digital Plan\n$9.90/month\n&nbsp;\n$0.99/month\nNo contract\nBilled at $0.99/month for the first 6 months, $9.90/month thereafter.

        "content": "BRASILIA  -     Since he returned to office in January, Brazil's President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has traveled to 21 countries and met with more than 50 heads of state, including two kings and the Pope.\nThe globe-trotting leftist leader, the first head of state to address the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday, has prioritized foreign trips in his third term so far, as he strives to restore his country as a global player.\n\"Brazil is back,\" he repeats in speeches across five continents, in contrast with the growing isolation that came with his predecessor Jair Bolsonaro's hard-right political stance and dismal environmental record.\nBut diplomats and foreign policy experts say Lula is far from restoring the \"soft power\" status Brazil enjoyed after his first two terms, from 2003 to 2010, when the country became a voice for the rising global south while remaining independent from both the U.S. and China.\nIn part, that reflects the choppier waters the 77-year-old Brazilian leader now navigates, as Beijing and Washington flirt with a new Cold War while war rages in Ukraine. Brazil has also become increasingly dependent on Asian markets, which buy half of its exports. China alone, Brazil's main trading partner, buys 37% of its farm exports.\n\"This is a very tricky balancing act and Lula so far has not been able to find the right equilibrium,\" said Oliver Stuenkel, an associate professor of international relations at the FGV think tank in Sao Paulo. \"There is a perception in Brazilian society now that he is tilting towards the Sino-Russian axis more than the West.\"\nOn Wednesday, Lula is scheduled to meet U.S. President Joe Biden to discuss the climate crisis on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly, focusing where the Brazilian leader has shined.\nST Asian Insider: Malaysia Edition\nGet exclusive insights into Malaysia in weekly round-up\nThank you!\nSign up\nBy signing up, I accept SPH Media's\nTerms &amp; Conditions\nand\nPrivacy Policy\nas amended from time to time.\nYes, I would also like to receive SPH Media Group's\nSPH Media Limited, its related corporations and affiliates as well as their agents and authorised service providers.\nmarketing and promotions.\nLula has helped to restore Brazil's central role in climate diplomacy, leading a regional rainforest summit, drawing global contributions to protect the Amazon and overhauling policies to bring down deforestation sharply.\nEven before he took office, Lula was greeted like a rock star last November at the U.N. climate change conference in Egypt. His polices have helped to nearly halve deforestation of the Brazilian Amazon through August, compared to the first eight months of last year, rebuilding Brazil's credibility for climate talks.\nBut his comments about the war in Ukraine - he has said both sides are responsible for the conflict as he sought to broker a peace deal - have angered U.S. and European allies, who have accused him of parroting Russian rhetoric.\nLula's penchant for off-the cuff remarks have occasionally made matters worse.\nDuring a G20 meeting in India this month, he said there was \"no way\"&nbsp;Russian President Vladimir Putin would be arrested if he attended next year's summit in Rio de Janeiro. When reporters probed him on Brazil's commitments to enforce an arrest warrant issued by the International Criminal Court, he rowed back his comments but suggested Brazil could leave the ICC.\n\"There have been some bruising moments. The whole Russia -Ukraine issue was a lesson learned,\" said Thomas Shannon, a former U.S. ambassador to Brazil who is now senior international policy advisor at Arnold &amp;amp; Porter.\nAt last month's BRICS summit in South Africa, where the group of leading emerging economies expanded its membership as China called for, Brazil got Chinese backing for a permanent U.N. Security Council seat it wants. But that is unlikely to happen any time soon, according to Shannon.\nThe closer ties to Beijing could complicate Brazil's relationship with Washington, including access to key technology, Shannon added.\n'OUTDATED AGENDA'\nCloser to home, Lula has reaped little in concrete terms from Latin America's broad left-of-center alignment. The Mercosur trade bloc took nearly half a year to respond formally to a new European position on a trade deal now on the ropes.\nAnd Lula's longstanding sympathies with leftist governments in Nicaragua and Venezuela accused of human rights abuses have him looking out of step with a new generation of progressive Latin American leaders.\nLula rolled out the red carpet for Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro in Brasilia at a regional summit in May, helping to bring the socialist leader out of isolation. Other leaders, including Chile's leftist President Gabriel Boric, criticized Maduro's presence.\nImpressions of ideological bias may hurt Brazil's image as the country returns to the international spotlight, putting Lula at odds sometimes with his Foreign Ministry, said Rubens Barbosa, a former Brazilian ambassador to London and Washington.\n\"Where is Brazil the defender of human rights? It's not clear what Brazil stands for today when it picks Putin and Maduro as allies,\" said a South American ambassador in Brasilia, who asked not to be identified.\n\"Brazil is rapidly wasting its soft power by trying to be an international player with an outdated agenda,\" he said.

        "content": "HANOI/WASHINGTON\n-\nUS President Joe Biden on Sunday secured deals with Vietnam on semiconductors and minerals as the strategic South-east Asian nation lifted Washington to Hanoi's highest diplomatic status alongside China and Russia.\nThe US has been pushing for the upgrade for months as it sees the manufacturing dynamo as a key country in its strategy to\nsecure global supply chains from China-related risks.\nA half-century after a lengthy and brutal Cold War-era conflict, Mr Biden arrived in Hanoi to a ceremony organised by the ruling Communist Party that included school children waving American flags and honour guards carrying bayoneted rifles.\nHe noted the strides that had been taken towards improved ties.\n\"We can trace a 50-year arc of progress between our nations, from conflict to normalisation, to this new elevated status,\" he said.\nThe partnership with Vietnam is part of the Biden administration\u2019s push\n\u201cto demonstrate to our  Indo-Pacific partners and to the world, the United States is a Pacific nation and we\u2019re not going anywhere\u201d, Mr Biden told reporters after the meeting in Hanoi.\nVietnam is navigating frosty relations between Washington and Beijing as the tech and textile exporter seeks its own foothold in the international competition to be a low-cost manufacturing hub.\nTop Chinese officials, possibly including President Xi Jinping, are expected to visit Vietnam in the coming days or weeks, officials and diplomats said, as Hanoi seeks to maintain good relations with all super powers.\nMr Biden also said in Hanoi he had talked with Mr Xi's deputy at the G-20, and that the two discussed  stability.\nCommunist Party General Secretary Nguyen Phu Trong, 79, remarked on the 80-year-old US president\u2019s appearance inside party headquarters, saying: \u201cYou have nary aged a day and I would say you look even better than before.\u201d\nRussian arms talks&nbsp;\nVietnam's longstanding relationship with Russia faces tests over the war in Ukraine, including talks with Moscow over a new arms supply deal that could trigger US sanctions.\nReuters has seen documents describing talks for a credit facility that Russia would extend to Vietnam to buy heavy weaponry, including anti-ship missiles, anti-submarine aircraft and helicopters, anti-aircraft missile systems and fighter jets.\nOne of them, a letter sent in May by Vietnam\u2019s Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh to the Russian government, showed interest in the possible new deal.\nMore on this Topic\nUS and China to discuss export controls but analysts do not expect breakthroughs\nUS\u2019 Raimondo raises chip issues with China officials; working group set up to discuss trade tensions\nA Vietnamese military officer confirmed the authenticity of the letter and the talks for a new US$8 billion (S$11 billion) credit facility to buy heavy weaponry.\nA spokesman for Vietnam's foreign ministry did not respond to multiple requests for comment on the documents, which show Moscow pushing for months for a loan deal that would bypass Western sanctions on Moscow.\nHanoi is in similar talks with multiple arms suppliers, including the United States. In recent weeks, Vietnam has engaged in several high-level defence meetings with top Russian officials.\nThe US-Vietnam upgrade will include a security dimension, Mr Jon Finer, the US principal deputy national security adviser, told reporters on Sunday, while on the plane with Mr Biden to Vietnam from a Group of 20 summit in India.\nHe said he had no arms deals to announce at this stage but stressed that the US and its partners could offer Vietnam help to diversify away from Russian military supplies, an offer which he said Vietnam was receptive to.\nThat would help Vietnam reduce military reliance on Moscow, \u201ca relationship we think they are increasingly uncomfortable with\u201d, Mr Finer said.\nChips, rare earths\nMr Biden's visit comes as bilateral trade and investment ties are growing and a long-simmering territorial dispute between Vietnam and China heats up in the South China Sea.\nVietnam Airlines is expected to sign an initial agreement to buy about 50 Boeing (BA.N) 737 Max jets in a deal valued at US$10 billion, timed to the trip.\nHighlighting Vietnam\u2019s growing importance as a \u201cfriend-shoring\u201d destination for US technology companies, executives from Google, Intel, Amkor, Marvell, GlobalFoundries and Boeing are expected to meet on Monday with Vietnamese tech executives and Secretary of State Antony Blinken in Hanoi.\nStill, semiconductors are the centrepiece of an action plan adopted during Mr Biden\u2019s visit, US officials said.\nBesides possible announcements by US corporations, it is unclear what else the the partnership could mean. The US government has US$100 million a year for five years available under the Chips Act to support semiconductor supply chains globally. A large part of it could go to Vietnam, officials said.\nMore support to train skilled workers is also part of the deal, as Vietnam faces a major shortage of engineers in the chips sector.\nAnother key issue is strengthening supply chains of critical minerals, especially rare earths, of which Vietnam has the world's largest deposits after China, according to US estimates, officials said.\nTwo people familiar with the plans said an agreement on rare earths was expected during Mr Biden's visit, which ends on Monday when he flies back to America.\nDetails, however, are scant. Past attempts by US companies to partner with Vietnamese rare earth firms have not succeeded, according to a person involved in one recent plan.\nHuman rights remain a controversial issue, with US officials regularly criticising Hanoi for jailing activists and limiting freedom of expression. Vietnam may show goodwill, with diplomats suggesting activists could be freed.\nREUTERS\nMore on this Topic\nUS\u2019 Raimondo raises chip issues with China officials; working group set up to discuss trade tensions\nChip companies, top US officials discuss China policy\nAlready a subscriber?&nbsp;\nLog in\nOur 12.12 Sale is here!\nStay informed with ST One Digital at $0.99/month for the first 6 months\nST One Digital Plan\n$9.90/month\n&nbsp;\n$0.99/month\nNo contract\nBilled at $0.99/month for the first 6 months, $9.90/month thereafter.

Since then, Xi and Putin have deepened relations.\nXi and Putin believe the U.S-dominated post-Cold War era is crumbling. The U.S. casts China as its biggest competitor and Russia as its biggest nation-state threat. U.S. President Joe Biden says this century will be defined by an existential contest between democracies and autocracies.\nAt last year's virtual summit, the group criticised what it called the negative impact of \"unilateral and unlimited expansion of global missile defence systems by certain countries or groups of countries\", without directly referring to NATO expansion or Western military assistance to Ukraine.\nIn a move that highlighted Beijing's pragmatic economy- driven approach, Xi presided over a ceremony on Wednesday with his Kazakh counterpart just hours before meeting Putin, to mark the departure of a fresh batch of cargo along the Trans-Caspian International Transport Route.\nThe route, also known as the Middle Corridor, starts in southeast Asia and China, runs through Kazakhstan, the Caspian Sea, Azerbaijan, Georgia and further to Europe. It has been heavily promoted by the West as an alternative to Asia-Europe land transit via Russia.\nBelarus will attend the Astana summit for the first time as a full member of the SCO, the Kremlin said.

        "content": "Hong Kong\n\u2013\nTen years ago almost to the day, while checking out a handful of luxury sedans from one of China\u2019s largest automakers, SAIC Motor, President Xi Jinping gave a pivotal speech that would set China on the course to dominate the electric vehicle (EV) industry.\nThe path to becoming a strong automaking nation lies in developing new energy vehicles, Mr Xi said, according to a Xinhua report in 2014. Claiming a head start, or \u201chigh ground\u201d, in this sector is key to the global competition, he said.\nIn 2014, China sold around 75,000 EVs and hybrids, and exported about 533,000 cars. The domestic market was dominated by international manufacturers such as Volkswagen and General Motors, which were allowed to enter by forming joint ventures with local players in the 1980s and 1990s.\nThis helped China transform from a bike-riding nation to a car-driving one. Home-grown carmakers and brands that did not work with foreign partners were seen as inferior and lagging behind in engine and other automotive technologies.\nTo get ahead and tackle environmental challenges, Beijing bet on fuel-efficient and alternative energy vehicles. The state had published a guideline in 2012 that established ways to develop the industry by setting sales goals, providing subsidies and allocating resources for building EV charging infrastructure, among other things.\nMr Xi\u2019s speech two years later signalled China\u2019s determination to use this as a way to leapfrog traditional Western and Asian auto powerhouses, in particular Japan, home to Toyota Motor.\nWith the stage set, China needed a catalyst to spur consumer interest in EVs, which in the early 2010s were mostly cheap cars with short ranges. That ended up being Tesla, which became the first foreign automaker to set up a wholly owned operation in China.\nGet tips to boost your career, money and lifestyle\nThank you!\nSign up\nBy signing up, I accept SPH Media's\nTerms &amp; Conditions\nand\nPrivacy Policy\nas amended from time to time.\nYes, I would also like to receive SPH Media Group's\nSPH Media Limited, its related corporations and affiliates as well as their agents and authorised service providers.\nmarketing and promotions.\nWith that special permission, Tesla completed its Shanghai factory in 2019. Its entry into the market motivated local players to come up with better EVs with longer ranges.\nFast-forward to 2024, China has become the world\u2019s largest auto market and sells more electrified vehicles than any other country, with 9.5 million cars delivered\nin 2023\n. It also controls the majority of the battery supply chain.\nHome-grown champion BYD dethroned Volkswagen to become the best-selling brand in China and, in the last quarter of 2023, surpassed Tesla as the world\u2019s largest producer of EVs. China also overtook Japan as the largest auto exporter, sending 4.14 million units abroad, with 1.55 million of them being EVs or plug-in hybrids.\nThe achievements prove that\nBeijing\u2019s industrial policy and investments have paid off. But they are also adding to tensions with the West. China\u2019s success in EVs, which could disrupt traditional auto supply chains that employ millions of people, has become a key source of discomfort in Washington and Brussels.\nAs a price war at home and slowing growth drive Chinese automakers to search for buyers for its affordable and tech-laden EVs elsewhere, they are running into trade barriers, especially in the European Union and the US, which are meanwhile trying to develop their own EV supply chains. Both have accused China of exporting its excess capacity.\nThe US has quadrupled import tariffs on Chinese cars to more than 100 per cent, while the EU is investigating Chinese EVs to see if there has been an unfair advantage from government subsidies.\nBrazil recently removed a tax break on imported EVs and even Russia, arguably Beijing\u2019s strongest ally and the largest destination for Chinese auto exports since the war with Ukraine, has asked Chinese carmakers to consider localising production.\nBeijing has threatened to hit back, with the China Chamber of Commerce to the EU saying on May 22 that the import tariffs on cars with large engines may be raised to 25 per cent from 15 per cent. There is a June 5 deadline for the EU to inform Chinese EV exporters of preliminary findings and whether tariffs will be imposed.\nSAIC\n, the state-owned manufacturer whose facility Mr Xi visited 10 years ago,\nhappens to be one of three Chinese automakers, along with BYD and Zhejiang Geely Holding Group, selected for further scrutiny by the EU in its anti-subsidy investigation. SAIC owns British-origin MG, which is one of the top-selling EV brands in Europe.\nAt an event on\nMay 24\nmarking the 10th anniversary of Mr Xi\u2019s speech, SAIC officials, including chief engineer Zu Sijie, said they have remembered the President\u2019s instructions well, and the company has consistently innovated around technologies like smart driving and connected cars.\nMr Li Zheng, co-founder of SAIC Qingtao New Energy Technology, a battery start-up backed by SAIC, took the opportunity to promise that executives will not be complacent\nas EV competition rises\n, noting that progress in solid-state batteries, which have a higher energy density and reduced fire risk, will be one way for China to maintain its edge.\n\u201cNew energy vehicles have become a strategic industry, fiercely contested by countries around the world,\u201d Mr Li said. \u201cThey\u2019re a key supporting force to our country\u2019s revitalisation of green sectors.\u201d\nA lot can happen in 10 years, but with SAIC having invested about 150 billion yuan (S$28.5 billion) in research and development over the past decade alone, even despite trade wars, 2034 looks bright.\nBLOOMBERG\nMore on this Topic\nChina EV makers taking longer to pay bills amid rising stress\n\u2018Bloodbath looms\u2019 in China\u2019s overcrowded EV industry\nAlready a subscriber?&nbsp;\nLog in\nOur 12.12 Sale is here!\nStay informed with ST One Digital at $0.99/month for the first 6 months\nST One Digital Plan\n$9.90/month\n&nbsp;\n$0.99/month\nNo contract\nBilled at $0.99/month for the first 6 months, $9.90/month thereafter.

In the biggest divergence, USDA expects soya bean imports to rise 39 per cent.\nThe USDA also expects growth in demand for animal feed, a key user of soya beans and corn, to outpace domestic corn output expansion and spur imports of sorghum and barley.\nNational security\nFood security has long been a priority for China, which has a painful history of famine and must feed nearly 20 per cent of the global population with less than 9 per cent of its arable land and 6 per cent of its water resources.\nThe urgency to cut dependence on imports grew after China faced supply chain disruptions during the Covid-19 pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine conflict.\nA trade war with the US, its No. 2 agriculture supplier after Brazil, and climate shocks such as heavy rain in 2023 that damaged China\u2019s wheat harvest have added to the challenge.\nOn June 1, China will implement a food security law that calls for absolute self-sufficiency in staple grains and requires local governments to include food security in their economic and development plans.\nThat will add to other efforts to bolster food production, including stepped-up grains insurance cover for farmers to protect their income, announced this week.\nIn April, Beijing launched a drive to raise grain output by at least 50 million tonnes by 2030, spotlighting upgraded farmland and investments in seed technology for higher crop yields and quality.\nMore on this Topic\nThe rich, black soil that fed a growing China is washing away\nChina floods hit rice, corn crops and trigger food inflation worries\nSoil changes\nChina increased production of corn, soya beans, potatoes and oilseeds in 2023 after expanding planting on previously uncultivated land and encouraging farmers to switch from cash crops to staples.\nHowever, even as the world\u2019s No. 2 corn producer harvested a record 288.84 million tonnes in 2023, imports surged to a near-record 27.1 million tonnes, driven by traders\u2019 preference for corn from overseas that is often higher quality and cheaper.\nProduction growth has hit a bottleneck due to insufficient arable land, small production scale and a lack of farmers and agriculture technology, state media reported.\nChina\u2019s arable land per capita is less than one-third the level in Brazil and one-sixth the level of the US, World Bank data from 2021 shows.\nDegraded and polluted soil in a country where a significant share of land is either rocky mountains or desert leave it with little space for expansion.\nThe government, which has increasingly called for protection of its fertile black soil, is set to complete a four-year soil survey in 2025. The last survey, in 2014, found that 40 per cent of its arable land was degraded from overuse of chemicals and heavy metal contamination.\nTo compensate, China is pouring millions of dollars into research of farming water-intensive crops such as rice in the deserts of Inner Mongolia and Xinjiang.\nBy turning sand into soil and breeding saline-tolerant crops, it aims to develop more farmland, a strategy industry executives say will take time and heavy investments in fertiliser, irrigation and biotechnology.\nOne obstacle is China\u2019s predominance of small farms, run by ageing owners who may not be able to afford or operate machinery such as drone sprayers, more productive seeds and technology such as big data and AI.\nFarms in China average 0.65ha, compared with 187ha in the US and 60ha in Germany. China is gradually shifting towards a consolidation of its fragmented farms.\nAfter decades of hesitation, it is slowly adopting genetically modified crops, in 2024 approving the planting of corn and soya bean varieties that are higher yielding and insect resistant, as well as gene-edited, disease-resistant wheat in hopes of accelerating production growth.\nChina\u2019s soya bean yields, at 1.99 tonnes per hectare, lag the 3.38 and 3.4 tonne yields in Brazil and the US, which have embraced genetically modified soya beans.\nBut analysts say the government\u2019s target for cutting soya bean imports is unrealistic. At best, China could ease its dependence on soya bean imports to 70 per cent from more than 80 per cent now, said Professor Carl Pray at Rutgers University in the US.\nAlmost all of China\u2019s soya beans are high protein varieties to produce tofu, and to replace imports it would need to rapidly expand production of high-oil producing varieties for cooking oil, which he said would be hard, even with research.\n\u201cTo produce enough soya beans to replace the Brazilian and US imports, there is just not enough land,\u201d Prof Pray said.\nREUTERS\nMore on this Topic\nChina probes agriculture minister for suspected disciplinary violations\nVillage vloggers in China cash in on live streaming\nAlready a subscriber?&nbsp;\nLog in\nOur 12.12 Sale is here!\nStay informed with ST One Digital at $0.99/month for the first 6 months\nST One Digital Plan\n$9.90/month\n&nbsp;\n$0.99/month\nNo contract\nBilled at $0.99/month for the first 6 months, $9.90/month thereafter.

I have fulfilled my dream.\u201d\nThe sprint weekend schedule has changed this season, with Shanghai\u2019s 19-lap sprint race on April 20 morning followed by main qualifying in its normal afternoon slot to determine the grid for the 56-lap race on April 21.\nVerstappen has won three out of the four grands prix this season with Sainz taking the chequered flag in the other, in Melbourne. The Spaniard too has concerns about this weekend.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s going to be a tough weekend for everyone. With how tricky one bump could make the car, I think it\u2019s not a good choice to choose to put the sprint after four or five years\u2019 absence,\u201d said Sainz.\n\u201cMaybe for people watching at home it\u2019s exciting, but for engineers and drivers, it\u2019s something that, in my opinion, we shouldn\u2019t take the risk and (we should) have a normal weekend.\u201d\nMercedes were previously the dominant force on the 5.451km Shanghai circuit, winning six times from 2012. But the Silver Arrows have struggled again this season.\nBoth Lewis Hamilton, who won the 2019 Shanghai race, and George Russell failed to finish in Melbourne and in the last race, the Japanese GP, they were ninth and seventh respectively.\nIt was a Red Bull one-two at Suzuka and Mercedes were also well beaten by both Ferraris, with the McLaren of Lando Norris and Aston Martin\u2019s Fernando Alonso finishing ahead of Russell as well.\nFerrari\u2019s Charles Leclerc and Sainz look the most likely to challenge the dominance of Verstappen and Red Bull teammate Sergio Perez again this weekend.\nLeclerc said Ferrari\u2019s race pace was not the issue \u2013 it was qualifying they needed to improve on.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had some difficulties putting the tyres in the right window on the out laps in qualifying,\u201d said the Monegasque.\n\u201cSo we really have to focus on that to make sure we can put it all together in China.\u201d\nAFP, REUTERS\nMore on this Topic\nLewis Hamilton ready for \u2018emotional\u2019 farewell season with Mercedes\nRed Bull\u2019s Max Verstappen dominates F1\u2019s Bahrain season-opener\nAlready a subscriber?&nbsp;\nLog in\nOur 12.12 Sale is here!\nStay informed with ST One Digital at $0.99/month for the first 6 months\nST One Digital Plan\n$9.90/month\n&nbsp;\n$0.99/month\nNo contract\nBilled at $0.99/month for the first 6 months, $9.90/month thereafter.

Many are former city-dwellers in search of an elusive prize in authoritarian China: Space for open discussion and exchange of ideas.\nIn one co-working space, a group of young adults asked questions about the effect of Trump-era populism on US media during a discussion led by a Chinese journalist about the American position on the Israel-Gaza conflict. In a nearby cafe, others discussed art, sexual harassment and the listlessness of China's youth.\nAs President Xi Jinping tightens his grip on the restricted personal freedoms of Chinese citizens and the economy stutters, exacerbating a youth unemployment crisis, Dali in Yunnan province has become a haven for those seeking to escape the pressure.\nThey are drawn by the cheap rents, mild climate, stunning scenery and a history of relative tolerance, which were popularised by a television drama this year about a digital nomad.\nDali's Old Town district, administratively part of a city of 650,000, has attracted culture workers since the late 1990s, said\nDr\nMinhua Ling, an expert on Chinese migration at the Geneva Graduate Institute, adding that the normalisation of remote work and Dali's less restrictive policies during\nChina's zero-Covid crackdown\nalso increased its appeal.\nIn November, searches for \u201cDali\u201d on WeChat were up 7\nper cent\nfrom a year ago, having surged some 290\nper cent\non one day in late July, when many Chinese were booking summer trips.\nReuters interviewed 13 Chinese migrants to Dali, who described a refuge on the fringes of mainstream society, but also one that implicitly challenges Xi\u2019s \u201cChina Dream\u201d of a prosperous nation ideologically loyal to the Communist Party.

But the message does not appear to resonate with urban youths who grew up with expectations of prosperity but now find social mobility hard to attain.\nDali, where several of the people interviewed by Reuters said they found an escape from the conservative social values of rural China, is an exception to the flight of youth to large cities that has occurred since China's economic modernisation.\nVisitors take pictures at a tower overlooking the old town of Dali in Yunnan.\nPHOTO: REUTERS\nMs\nBai moved to Dali in September, quitting her government job to give online astrology readings.

Staff at the latter business say they sometimes\nhave dozens of couples on busy days.\nPart of the appeal, experts studying the phenomenon say, is that it gives young women a way to perform an idealised heteronormative relationship.\nConservative social attitudes towards women remain widespread in China, often reinforced by state media and popular culture.\nAside from assuaging safety concerns, hiring a female cosplayer ensures a level of equality and understanding not necessarily guaranteed in a real-life relationship.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s important what gender the person being commissioned is,\u201d said Fudan University\u2019s Tian Qian.\n\u201cWhat is important is that (the cosplayer) is a vessel, because the client needs a vehicle for their emotions.\u201d\nAnother academic, Ms Zhou Zixing, wrote that cos commissioning allows women \u201cto gain a voice that is fully respected by the opposite sex... responding to, breaking, and reconstructing the gender rules of the real world\u201d.\nCosplayer Xu Yunting (right) and Ms Feng Xinyu making a cake at a pastry shop during their \u201ccos commissioning\u201d date in Shanghai.\nPHOTO: AFP\n\u2018Low-quality guys\u2019\nAt the cake-decorating class, Ms Feng leaned over the table, fondly watching Ms Xu pipe generous amounts of icing onto a sponge cake.\nAfterwards, Ms Xu gently helped Ms Feng remove her apron, modelling Jesse\u2019s gentlemanly behaviour.\n\u201cThe guys in the games are all quality guys,\u201d said Ms Xu. \u201cI think (clients) will be able to improve their requirements in real life in terms of what they want from a man, so that they don\u2019t settle for low-quality guys.\u201d\nMs Xu\u2019s mother Fang Xiuqing admitted her initial reaction when she learnt what\nher daughter\nwas doing was: \u201cHow could this happen to\nher\n?\u201c\nBut she has since come around to the idea. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a profession, it\u2019s a hobby,\u201d said Madam Fang. \u201cShe gets enjoyment from it, and she also brings joy to others.\u201d\nFudan University\u2019s Ms Tian said cos commissions can act as \u201cemotional sustenance\u201d.\n\u201cAlthough this is a paid interaction, it still gives a sense of being seen, which has a certain healing effect to it.\u201d\nAFP\nMore on this Topic\nEmployees in China given time off to play new Black Myth: Wukong video game\nCosplay \u2018angel\u2019 wins praise in China for saving a man who blacked out in the rain\nAlready a subscriber?&nbsp;\nLog in\nOur 12.12 Sale is here!\nStay informed with ST One Digital at $0.99/month for the first 6 months\nST One Digital Plan\n$9.90/month\n&nbsp;\n$0.99/month\nNo contract\nBilled at $0.99/month for the first 6 months, $9.90/month thereafter.

        "content": "PARIS - The Chinese dream team came to Paris on a mission to claim every gold medal on offer, after missing out on one in Tokyo - the inaugural mixed doubles title.\nUnder enormous pressure they duly delivered, securing Ma Long a spot in history as the only six-time gold medalist in table tennis and China's most decorated Olympian.\nChina's dominance in the sport speaks for itself. They have earned 37 gold medals out of the 42 contested so far at the summer Olympics. The women's singles final was between two Chinese players, a replay of Tokyo. In the best-of-five team competitions, neither the Chinese men's nor women's teams dropped a single match.\nEven with the best team, however, the golden sweep wasn't achieved without twists and turns. The biggest surprise happened when Sweden's 19th seed Truls Moregard knocked out China's world number one Wang Chuqin in the round of 32.\nThat boosted the confidence of 22-year-old Moregard, who went on to clinch the first silver for Sweden in the event since 2000.\n\"I didn\u2019t plan for this when I came here and it feels surreal. I really felt I should just let it all go and really believe in myself and play the table tennis that I like,\" said Moregard.\nThe sport also had its moment in France thanks to the sensational Lebrun brothers. With football legend Zinedine Zidane among the fans, 17-year-old Felix Lebrun won several thrilling deciding games and eventually clinched bronze.\nHe then led the French team, with his brother Alexis and Simon Gauzy, to add another bronze for France after overcoming the Japanese team.\n\"He is a champion, we will try to make him a legend,\" said French team coach Nathanael Molin of Lebrun, the youngest ever to win a table tennis singles Olympics medal.\nWhile Sweden and France's performance marked the first time two European nations climbed on the podium for the teams event, beating the Chinese remains the Everest of table tennis.\nFan Zhendong, with a powerful backhand serve and steady performance under pressure, beat Japan's Tomokazu Harimoto after a 9-9 tie in the seventh game in singles, and then survived a showdown with Moregard a second time in a deciding game in the team event.\nChinese duo Chen Meng and Wang Manyu were 9-5 behind in the last game of the doubles match against Japan but managed to fight back and claim the match.\n\"Since the last point hadn't been decided, there was still a chance to come back. Our intense desire to win, with the unwavering belief that we could do it, kept us going,\" said Chen, who has four gold medals.

        "content": "PARIS - Table tennis player Zeng Zhiying said her \u201cdream came true\u201d on June 27 after making her Olympic debut aged 58, despite suffering defeat for her adopted Chile.\nZeng represented China, the country of her birth, as a young player, but retired at 20 and moved to Chile, where she has lived for the past 35 years.\nShe did not touch a table tennis bat for decades until she began playing again during the pandemic, and she quickly rose through the ranks to become one of South America\u2019s best players.\nHer comeback has taken her all the way to Paris, where she lost 4-1 to Lebanon\u2019s Mariana Sahakian - herself 46 - in the preliminary round.\nPlaying in front of a full house and with extra support from a small but noisy group of Chilean fans, Zeng said the experience had been a rewarding one.\n\u201cAfter 30 years I came back to table tennis, and now that I have been able to play at the Olympics, my dream came true,\u201d Zeng said, in comments translated from Spanish, which she speaks with a Chilean accent.\n\u201cI gave my best in every competition and that\u2019s how I managed to get here.\u201d\nZeng was born in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou and began playing from an early age under the tutelage of her table tennis coach mother.\nShe was chosen for China\u2019s national team at 16 but her career hit the skids before table tennis made its Olympic debut in 1988 and she quit the sport.\nShe moved to Chile to coach schoolchildren but then drifted away from table tennis and stopped playing to focus on her business.\nSedate pace\nNow, she is back on the scene and refuses to rule out another Olympic appearance after getting her first taste of the big time.\n\u201cIt will be a little difficult but I will always keep playing until my body says stop,\u201d said Zeng, who will be 62 by the time of the next Games, in Los Angeles.\nZeng\u2019s match against Sahakian, another veteran, played out at a noticeably more sedate pace than the other matches being played at the South Paris Arena.\nZeng took the first game but then fell out of contention as her opponent began to take control of the match.\nZeng Zhiying\u2019s opponent, Mariana Sahakian of Lebanon, is herself 46 years old.\nPHOTO: REUTERS\n\u201cMy opponent was very patient,\u201d said Zeng.\n\u201cIn the first game she was a bit anxious but she settled down as the match went on and it was quite hard to beat her from then on.\n\u201cI gave everything in the game. Of course there are regrets, but it\u2019s fine that I didn\u2019t manage to win.\u201d\nZeng is not even the oldest player in the women\u2019s tournament at the Paris Games - Luxembourg\u2019s 61-year-old Ni Xialian takes that title.\nNi was also born in China before switching allegiance to another country.\nZeng believes the nation of her birth will continue to produce champions.\n\u201cThe system of repetition and timing is unique,\u201d she said.\n\u201cWhat makes the difference is how many times the young players play \u2013 all day, every day, over and over.\u201d AFP\nMore on this Topic\nIn Pictures: The Olympic Games opening ceremony in Paris\nParis Olympics 2024: Get the latest updates, TeamSG highlights and visual stories\nAlready a subscriber?&nbsp;\nLog in\nOur 12.12 Sale is here!\nStay informed with ST One Digital at $0.99/month for the first 6 months\nST One Digital Plan\n$9.90/month\n&nbsp;\n$0.99/month\nNo contract\nBilled at $0.99/month for the first 6 months, $9.90/month thereafter.

        "content": "WASHINGTON\n-\nMr Jeff Bezos, the billionaire owner of The Washington Post, whose decision to\nend presidential endorsements at the paper\nset off a firestorm inside and outside the paper last week, said on\nOct 28\nin his first comments about the change that it had been done to improve the newsroom\u2019s credibility, not to protect his own personal interests.\n\u201cPresidential endorsements do nothing to tip the scales of an election,\u201d Mr Bezos wrote in an essay published on The Post\u2019s website.\nHe added: \u201cWhat presidential endorsements actually do is create a perception of bias. A perception of non-independence. Ending them is a principled decision, and it\u2019s the right one.\u201d\nThe paper had announced the decision to end endorsements on\nOct 25\n, in a note put out by Mr Will Lewis, its chief executive, who said it was \u201ca statement in support of our readers\u2019 ability to make up their own minds\u201d about the election.\nBut at the time, the company said nothing about Mr Bezos\u2019 motivation for the decision.\nSome speculated without evidence that Mr Bezos, the founder of Amazon, who has owned the paper since 2013, was trying to gain favor with a potential Trump administration. The paper\u2019s editorial board had already drafted an endorsement of Vice-President Kamala Harris.\nMr Bezos said on\nOct 28\nthat he had not and would not pursue his personal interests through his ownership of the Post, and that \u201cno quid pro quo of any kind is at work here\u201d.\n\u201cYou can see my wealth and business interests as a bulwark against intimidation, or you can see them as a web of conflicting interests,\u201d he added.\n\u201cOnly my own principles can tip the balance from one to the other. I assure you that my views here are, in fact, principled, and I believe my track record as owner of the Post since 2013 backs this up.\u201d\nMr Bezos said that while he wished his decision had come earlier than it did, less than two weeks before the election, the timing was because of \u201cinadequate planning, and not some intentional strategy\u201d.\nAfter the announcement on\nOct 25\n, some of the paper\u2019s best-known journalists spoke out about the decision and thousands of readers complained about it in comments on the Post\u2019s website.\nMr Marty Baron, the recent editor of the Post who led the paper through a period of editorial and business success, called the decision \u201ccowardice, with democracy as its casualty\u201d, in a post on the social platform X.\nLegendary Post journalists Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein said in a statement that the decision ignored \u201cThe Washington Post\u2019s own overwhelming reportorial evidence on the threat Donald Trump poses to democracy\u201d.\nThe paper\u2019s news coverage of Trump has continued to be aggressive in recent days.\nEarlier on\nOct 28\n, three journalists said they were stepping down from the Post\u2019s 10-person editorial board. All three are staying at the paper in other roles.\nThe three \u2013 Mr David Hoffman, who has worked at the Post since 1982; Ms Molly Roberts; and Ms Mili Mitra, the director of audience for the opinion department \u2013 all said during a mid-morning meeting of the editorial board that they were stepping down, according to a person with knowledge of the discussion.\nIn online statements, Mr Hoffman and Ms Roberts said publicly that they felt it was important for the paper to endorse Ms Harris because they considered Trump a danger to the country. Ms Mitra did not respond to requests for comment.\n\u201cI believe we face a very real threat of autocracy in the candidacy of Donald Trump,\u201d Mr Hoffman said in his letter announcing his intent to step down to the editor of the opinion department, Mr David Shipley.\n\u201cI find it untenable and unconscionable that we have lost our voice at this perilous moment.\u201d\nMr Hoffman received a Pulitzer Prize for editorial writing at a ceremony on\nOct 24\nfor a series on authoritarian regimes suppressing dissent.\nHe said he would continue working on several projects he had under way, \u201cincluding the expanded effort to support press freedom around the world\u201d.\nMs Roberts said in a post on X: \u201cThe mission of an editorial board is simpler than it may seem: We want to make the country and the world a better place by supporting the best candidate or the best policy, and condemning the worst. We want to change minds. But above all else, we want to write with moral clarity. If we can\u2019t do that, what are we doing at all?\u201d\nMs Roberts said the imperative on the editorial board to endorse Ms Harris over Trump was \u201cabout as morally clear as it gets\u201d.\nMr Bezos ended his essay by saying that he would not allow the paper to \u201cfade into irrelevance\u201d, and that to regain trust among readers the paper needed to exercise \u201cnew muscles\u201d.\n\u201cSome changes will be a return to the past, and some will be new inventions,\u201d he continued. \u201cCriticism will be part and parcel of anything new, of course.\u201d\nNYTIMES\nMore on this Topic\nOver 200,000 people cancel Washington Post subscriptions after it blocks Harris endorsement: NPR\nDaughter of LA Times owner says decision not to endorse Kamala Harris stems from stance on Gaza war\nJoin\n&nbsp;\nST's Telegram channel\n&nbsp;\nand get the latest breaking news delivered to you.\nUS presidential election 2024\nJournalism\nJeff Bezos\nNewspapers\nThanks for sharing!",

        "content": "At 20, a devastating car accident left Ms Fathimah Zohra paralysed from her neck down. Despite facing chronic pain seven years on, which she manages through medication, she is determined to overcome every challenge in her second chance at life.&nbsp;\n\u201cLife can change in seconds. But what you make of the new life you have is what matters,\u201d says the 27-year-old, who\u2019s better known as Zoe Zora.&nbsp;\nOnce an athletic teenager who played soccer and participated in track and field, Zora has learned to thrive in her new reality.\nIt took about one year of intensive rehabilitation and exercise before she regained enough movement in her arms to carry out tasks independently \u2013 from doing her own make-up to completing a strength-training workout.&nbsp;\n\u201cExercising gives me the physical and mental strength to live each day to the best of my ability, whether it\u2019s to work or do the things I love.\u201d\nAnd one of the things that she has directed this strength to is to help empower others with disabilities. Two years ago, she joined Inclus, a social enterprise that enables people with disabilities to pursue gainful employment and independence\n.\n\u201cAt 25, I felt like I wanted to do more for the community,\u201d she recalls. \u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to contribute to the inclusive employment space and help other individuals with disabilities live sustainable and independent lives.\u201d\nWatch this video to find out how Zoe Zora is making society more inclusive:\nFinding newfound purpose through inclusive employment\nAs an inclusive employment recruiter, Zora works closely with employers to promote disability inclusion. For instance, she helps them break away from outdated stereotypes and stigmas about people with disabilities through initiatives such as inclusivity training and workshops.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\u201cThe challenge is often changing preconceived notions,\u201d Zora explains. \u201cIt takes a lot of education and awareness to shift mindsets.\u201d\nDespite the challenges, she has found purpose and deep satisfaction in her work. \u201cSupporting someone through their employment journey and seeing them secure a job is incredibly rewarding. It\u2019s exciting to know I\u2019ve played a part in helping someone achieve what they\u2019ve been striving for.\u201d\nZora advocates for more inclusive workplaces, speaking at events to empower employers to embrace diversity.

She aims to inspire others while managing her disability and living life to the fullest.\n\u201cSocial media is where everyone spends their time these days and many are negatively impacted by it,\u201d she says.&nbsp;\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I try to be real and vulnerable on my page instead of just showing a highlight reel. It\u2019s important to remind people that they\u2019re not alone, especially when it comes to mental health.\u201d\nThis stems from her own experiences of receiving criticism online, often from people accusing her of faking her disability or seeking attention. In fact, she used to feel so insecure and ashamed of her disability that she stayed off social media for about a year after being an active user for four years.&nbsp;\nToday, Zora has even resumed modelling for sports and beauty brands on an adhoc basis \u2013&nbsp; something she used to do in her teens \u2013 and speaks at events such as the Enabling Lives Festival.\n\u201c\nShowing up and advocating for disabled bodies was more important to me (than the negative comments),\u201d she says.\nMore on this Topic\nIndie films, live gigs, fun events: How she\u2019s giving audiences a \u2018mental breathing space\u2019\nChanging society\u2019s perceptions\nWhen Zora became paralysed, it was not just the physical difficulty of going out and about with her activities that she had to cope with. Even now, she has to deal with how strangers tend to stare and feel pity for her, or tell her she would walk again one day.\nShe says: \u201cWhile I understand their good intentions, being disabled is the reality of my life and I\u2019ve come to terms with it. Although I do struggle at times, I can also be happy. So don\u2019t feel bad for me because I sit in a wheelchair.&nbsp;\n\u201cWhen you pity someone with a disability, you take away our power. Instead, acknowledge our experiences, and support and encourage us.\u201d\nZora shares her life candidly on social media, showing the realities of managing disability while living life to the fullest. PHOTO: COURTESY OF ZOE ZORA\nZora wants society to understand that how someone looks does not always reflect how they feel.&nbsp;\n\u201cI might look confident, but I could be battling internal struggles,\u201d she explains. \u201cMany people with mental struggles feel the need to hide them, and that\u2019s why I believe it\u2019s so important to advocate for mental health. It\u2019s okay not to be okay.\u201d\nShe believes in the power of compassion and understanding, especially when dealing with what she calls \u201cinvisible disabilities\u201d.&nbsp;\n\u201cSome people don\u2019t know how to share their struggles, so be kind and give them space to be themselves. I share my experiences because I don\u2019t want others to feel alone.\u201d\nThe encouragement Zora gives to those in her community has given her strength to continue to make a difference for them. Private messages of gratitude and positive feedback from strangers also motivate her to continue to lift the hopes of those who feel helpless and \u201cunseen\u201d.\nLending her support in this journey are her loved ones, especially her parents, five brothers and two sisters, who were her \u201chands and legs\u201d and helped her build emotional strength to fight against all odds.&nbsp;\n\u201cI learnt that you can't always do things alone, and it's okay to get help and accept support from others. There\u2019s so much good in the world, we need to stop focusing only on the bad,\u201d she says.\nThis article was first published on\nherworld.com\nas part of the\nHer World, Her Spark\nseries.\n&nbsp;\nIn partnership with\nJoin&nbsp;\nST's WhatsApp Channel\n&nbsp;and get the latest news and must-reads.\nBranded content\nThanks for sharing!",

        "content": "NEW YORK \u2013 Former US president Donald Trump is expected to spend the morning of March 25 in the courtroom of a New York judge who might soon preside over his criminal trial and, ultimately, throw him behind bars. And that is not even the legal predicament that worries Trump most that day.\nThe hearing for his Manhattan criminal prosecution \u2013 in which he is accused of covering up a sex scandal to pave his way to the presidency \u2013 comes as he\nraces to fend off a financial crisis\narising from a US$454 million (S$613 million) judgment in another case. New York Attorney-General Letitia James, who brought that civil fraud suit against the former president and his family business, might begin to collect as soon as March 25.\nTo avoid a mortal threat to the Trump Organisation, Trump must persuade another company to post a bond on his behalf, promising that it will cover the judgment if he loses a pending appeal and fails to pay. Yet, Trump\u2019s lawyers said in court papers that securing the bond would be a \u201cpractical impossibility\u201d because he would need to pledge about US$550 million in cash and liquid investments as collateral to the bond company \u2013 an admission that laid bare Trump\u2019s cash crunch.\nUnless Trump strikes an eleventh-hour deal, Ms James could freeze his bank accounts, and begin the long and complicated process of seizing some of his properties. And barring Trump\u2019s lawyers achieving an improbable legal triumph, the judge in his criminal case could set a trial date for as soon as in\nApril\n.\nThe twin threats \u2013 on the same day, in the same city \u2013 crystallise two of Trump\u2019s greatest and longest-held fears: a criminal conviction and a public perception that he does not have as much cash as he claims.\nFor decades, Trump employed a broad array of tactics to keep those fears at bay, learning from his well-connected father and his own ruthless lawyer and fixer Roy Cohn. After fending off local and federal investigations, not to mention financial ruin, Trump came to believe that any problems could be solved by personal connections \u2013 and a whole lot of money.\n\u201cIf Trump uses one thing to score the game, it has always been money,\u201d said Mr Jack O\u2019Donnell, a former casino executive who worked for Trump in the early 1990s and wrote a tell-all book about him. \u201cIf he has more money than someone, he is winning and the other person is losing. And if someone has more money than Trump, he has the fear that someone will say he is losing to that person.\u201d\nTrump has also described the shame of becoming a criminal defendant four times over. Even as his advisers used the indictments to great effect in fund raising and galvanising his Republican base, Trump has conceded that the charges pained him.\n\u201cNobody wants to be indicted,\u201d Trump told reporters aboard his airplane last June. \u201cI don\u2019t care that my poll numbers went up by a lot. I don\u2019t want to be indicted. I\u2019ve never been indicted. I went through my whole life, now I get indicted every two months.\u201d\nIt was a massive shock for a man who, until then, had navigated a wary path around law enforcement scrutiny throughout his long public life.\nHe was investigated criminally over a land acquisition in the mid-1970s, yet escaped unscathed. A federal special counsel examined possible ties between the Trump 2016 campaign and Russia, as well as his effort to obstruct the investigation as president, and recommended no charges. He was twice impeached by a Democrat-led House, but twice the Senate did not convict him.\nBefore 2023, nothing stuck.\n\u201cHe\u2019s been so lucky, and nobody\u2019s ever had worse adversaries than this guy,\u201d said Mr Ty Cobb, a lawyer who worked in the Trump White House during the special counsel investigation and has become sharply critical of the former president.\nSome of it was luck, but his public relations strategy paid off as well. Trump deployed a mix of bare-knuckle tactics \u2013 attacking prosecutors as \u201ccorrupt\u201d and guilty of the same conduct of which he was suspected \u2013 and arm-twisting charm.\nMore on this Topic\nTrump media merger is approved, providing fresh source of cash\nWhy no one will lend to Trump\nAmong Trump\u2019s prized relationships was with Mr Robert Morgenthau, the Manhattan district attorney for decades.\nWhile Mr Morgenthau was in office, he would joke privately that his pet charity, the Police Athletic League, was the only one to which Trump routinely donated. And when Trump supported Mr Morgenthau politically, some Trump Organisation officials were told they needed to write cheques of their own to the district attorney\u2019s campaign, according to two people familiar with what took place. (People who worked with Mr Morgenthau, who died in 2019, said there was nothing directly involving Trump that crossed their desks that would have required investigation.)\nThe district attorney\u2019s office, now held by Mr Alvin Bragg, was the first to indict Trump in\n2023\nbefore other prosecutors followed suit. The former president privately reacted with disbelief that his hometown district attorney had dared to come after him.\nIn 2021, when the office was intensifying its investigation, Trump told an interviewer that \u201cBob Morgenthau would not have stood for this\u201d.\nMr Bragg\u2019s case concerns a personally embarrassing episode for Trump: a\n$130,000 hush-money payment to porn actress Stormy Daniels,\nmeant to bury her story of a sexual encounter with Trump. His fixer at the time, Mr Michael Cohen, made the payment. Trump, who has denied the affair, is accused of falsifying business records on his reimbursement of Mr Cohen.\nTrump\u2019s lawyers, as they do in each of his legal entanglements, are seeking to delay the trial past Election Day. If Trump is re-elected, the cases against him would probably grind to a halt.\nThe New York judge presiding over the case, Mr Juan Merchan, recently delayed the trial for three weeks, until April 15, and the hearing on March 25 will determine whether he postpones it further.\nDespite the best efforts of Trump\u2019s lawyers to delay or scuttle the case, it is the indictment that his advisers are the least concerned. They argue it is the least politically damaging to the presumptive Republican nominee, despite the personally mortifying details.\nHowever, the New York Attorney-General\u2019s civil fraud case, which accuses Trump of wildly exaggerating his net worth, has struck a particularly sensitive nerve with the former president.\nTrump measures his wealth in the billions, a sum that largely stems from the value of his properties. Although valuing real estate is more of an art than a science, the Attorney-General disputed some of Trump\u2019s purported estimates as wildly exaggerated, concluding that he\ninflated his net worth by as much as US$2 billion.\nMore on this Topic\nTrump under oath: Assets are \u2018Mona Lisas\u2019, his name worth $4 billion\n\u2018Sorry, Donald\u2019: Biden trolls Trump over campaign cash lead\nAnd then there\u2019s his cash. Trump argues that he is relatively liquid for a real estate developer, stating in a deposition in\n2023\nthat he had more than US$400 million in cash.\nAlthough The New York Times was unable to verify the precise number, records and interviews show he recently had more than US$350 million in cash as well as stocks and other investments he can sell in a hurry. While significant, it is not enough to secure the appeal bond.\nTypically, when facing outsize financial troubles, Trump has refused to concede that anything is wrong, dating back to when his business nearly collapsed in the early 1990s. People who have known him for many years say he has become accustomed to believing he can give the appearance of waiting out problems until circumstances change, banking on some sort of rescue at the last minute.\nIn the 1990s, banks bailed him out, even though he had massively overextended himself with a costly development of the Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey.\nWith Ms James poised to begin enforcing the US$454 million fraud judgment, Trump appeared to be hoping for similar twists of fate. He could, for example, try to secure a loan from a private equity firm or a hedge fund. He is also hoping an appeals court will pause the judgment.\nAnd then there is the windfall he could reap from his social media company, whose shares start trading on the stock market as early as on March 25. His stake is currently valued at roughly US$3 billion, but it might come too late: He is prohibited from selling for six months. Although Trump could find ways around that restriction that enable him to use his stake to raise cash for the appeal bond, no such deal appears imminent.\nA post on Trump\u2019s Truth Social platform on March 22 captured his insecurities. He claimed (falsely) that he had almost US$500 million in cash, and also claimed (falsely) that he had been planning to use that money to fund his own campaign; in reality, he last spent money on his own candidacy in 2016, and the amount was still nowhere near what he had claimed he would spend.\nBut his post was honest about at least one thing: To him, the US$454 million judgment was a \u201cshocking number\u201d.

        "content": "DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. -- Overlooked and underappreciated. That's the perception that has driven newly crowned Daytona 500 champion William Byron to achievements beyond his imagination.\nByron learned how to race on a computer, and when team owner Rick Hendrick promoted him to the NASCAR Cup Series as a 20-year-old in 2018, there were plenty of skeptics who looked askance at the move.\nAt 26, Byron is the youngest driver in an organization that includes six-time most popular driver Chase Elliott, who won the 2020 series championship; and Kyle Larson, the 2021 champion who often is described as a generational talent across a multitude of racing platforms.\n\"I'm the other guy,\" Byron said on Monday night after doing what no other Hendrick driver has been able to do since Dale Earnhardt Jr. won the Daytona 500 in 2014.\nIn fact, Byron is the only current Hendrick driver who has ever won a Cup points event on the Daytona oval, where he claimed the first of his 11 career victories in the 2020 summer race.\nLast year, Byron won a series-best six races and qualified for the Championship 4, finishing third in the final standings. Nevertheless, despite his obvious flair for superspeedway racing, the driver of the No. 24 Chevrolet opened at disrespectful 18-to-1 odds for the Daytona 500 at DraftKings Sportsbook.\n\"Yeah, I use it all as fuel, so just keep it coming,\" Byron said. \"All the preseason predictions and everything. I just try to stay quietly focused. I feel like for me, I do well having my own space and being able to work through the things with my race team...\n\"I don't read too much into it. I'm never going to be the most vocal guy. I just enjoy getting in the race car and putting the helmet on and going to work. That's what I've always lived for.\"\nOne clear catalyst for Byron's career has been the pairing in 2021 with crew chief Rudy Fugle, who called the shots from the pit box when Byron broke into the NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series with a seven-win season with Kyle Busch Motorsports in 2016.\nTogether, Byron and Fugle have won 10 Cup races at Hendrick Motorsports.\n\"William puts in the work,\" team owner Rick Hendrick said in a Monday night post-race press conference. \"That's all he thinks about. He's in the simulator. He's watching tapes. He has worked so hard. People don't realize how much time he puts in.\n\"But bringing Rudy on gave him that confidence, because they were so successful in the Truck Series, and, man, they just picked up and clicked. And when you think about his age and how smart he is and how he races like a guy that's been doing it for a long time, doesn't make many mistakes, but he just eats and drinks and sleeps winning. He puts in the work.\"\nIn Monday's rain-delayed Daytona 500, the work paid off. Byron grabbed the lead after a restart with four laps left, took the white flag and was narrowly ahead of teammate Alex Bowman when NASCAR called the fifth and final caution for Ross Chastain's slide through the grass in the tri-oval.\nThe victory wasn't just a career-defining moment for Byron. It was the perfect kickoff for the year-long 40th anniversary celebration for Hendrick Motorsports, whose drivers, past and present, have amassed a series-best 302 victories since its founding in 1984. That was the season Geoff Bodine rescued a company on the brink of extinction with his win at Martinsville.\nIn breaking a decade-long DAYTONA 500 drought, Byron also gave Hendrick its ninth victory in the Great American Race, tying the organization with Petty Enterprises for most all-time.\n\"Tonight he told me, he said, \u2018I never thought I'd race here, and now I've won the Daytona 500,'\" Hendrick said. \"So pretty special.\"\nIn the post-race celebration, no one seemed happier than Hendrick vice chairman Jeff Gordon, who drove the No. 24 Chevrolet to 93 victories and four series championships.\n\"I try not to be biased, but William is making it hard on me,\" said Gordon, who won the Daytona 500 three times. \"It's 2024, and the 24 is always going to be very, very special to me. But what I loved the most is seeing him make it his number and building that fan base -- 24 fans have been around for a long time, but his own fans.\n\"A win like this, my gosh, this is going to elevate that up to the next level and bring a whole lot more new fans to the sport and for William. That's what I get excited (about) and look forward to.\"\nIt's also something Byron will have to get used to. And he may have to find a new source of motivation.\nHis days as \"the other guy\" are numbered.\n--By Reid Spencer, NASCAR Wire Service.

Rome will also propose creating a steering committee to ensure greater G7 coordination on AI.\nThe source said G7 leaders were \"pretty much on the same page\" over AI, adding that there was broad consensus on most of the major issues facing the wealthy-nation club, including on how to deal with China.\nThere was a determination on all sides to avoid tensions with Beijing, the source said, adding: \"Nobody wants to impede or put obstacles towards Chinese growth.\"\nThere was also agreement, the source said, on the need to develop economies in Africa and try to stem illegal immigration - a domestic priority for Meloni, who is struggling to honour an 2022 election pledge to stem migrant flows.

        "content": "LONDON\n-\nBritain\u2019s top climate change advisory body on Jan 30 accused Prime Minister Rishi Sunak of creating \u201cmixed signals\u201d and a perception of \u201cslowing UK climate ambition\u201d, as it demanded renewed action.\nThe Climate Change Committee (CCC) said the country\u2019s image as a leader on the issue had suffered since\na speech by Mr Sunak in September\nin which he pushed back the UK\u2019s net-zero initiatives by delaying the ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars and the phasing out of gas boilers.&nbsp;\nThe Conservative government has also approved a new coal mine and licensed new oil and gas production.\n\u201cThe international perception of the UK\u2019s climate ambition suffered from mixed messages following announcements on new fossil fuel developments and the prime minister\u2019s speech to soften some net-zero policies,\u201d the committee said.\nIt advises on government policy over how to reach Britain\u2019s net-zero aims, and on Jan 30 issued its latest report reviewing progress at the COP28 climate summit in Dubai in December.\nThe CCC added that Mr Sunak\u2019s September speech and the government\u2019s recent decisions \u201chave contributed to a perception of slowing UK climate ambition by members of the international community\u201d.\n\u201cStrong, consistent domestic policy and communications on climate that avoid mixed messaging are crucial to be able to robustly advocate for high climate ambition internationally,\u201d it added.\nThe report comes weeks after Mr Chris Stark quit as CCC head, following criticism of Mr Sunak\u2019s environmental policies. He has now called meeting the country\u2019s 2050 net-zero target \u201cwishful thinking\u201d.\nMr Stark\u2019s resignation came just days after Conservative MP and former energy minister Chris Skidmore announced he was quitting as a lawmaker in opposition to Mr Sunak\u2019s decision to grant hundreds of new oil and gas drilling licences.\nMr Sunak has defended the policies, saying the UK would pursue a \u201cpragmatic\u201d approach to achieving net-zero.\nThe UK leader has said policies have been imposed \u201cwithout having an honest conversation with the country about what\u2019s required to deliver them\u201d.\nThe government remained \u201ccommitted\u201d to those targets, he insisted, adding that he had \u201cabsolute confidence and belief that we will hit them\u201d.\nThe policy shift comes as British voters are facing a cost-of-living crisis that has seen food and housing costs spiral.\nSome within Mr Sunak\u2019s ruling Conservatives \u2013 in power since 2010 \u2013 have raised concerns over the potential financial cost of reaching net-zero.\nThe main opposition Labour Party \u2013 leading in the polls ahead of an expected general election later in\n2024\n\u2013 have joined environmental campaigners and others in criticising Mr Sunak\u2019s policy changes.

        "content": "NEW YORK \u2013 Salmon is good for you \u2013 that part people know.\n\u201cFish is one of the few animal foods consistently linked to health benefits, and salmon is at the top of my list when I recommend fish to people,\u201d said Dr Dariush Mozaffarian, a distinguished professor at Tufts University and director of its Food is Medicine Institute.\nBut choosing which type to eat for your health \u2013 sockeye or coho, wild or farmed \u2013 is not so obvious.\nResearchers have found that the nutritional value of salmon can vary depending on the species. And there is a consumer perception that farmed and wild-caught salmon differ in terms of their nutrients and levels of contaminants \u2013 beliefs that research partly supports.\nFrom healthy fats to heavy metals, here are answers to some salmon-related questions.\nWhat is so great about salmon?\nDr Mozaffarian highlighted omega-3 fatty acids \u2013 specifically DHA and EPA \u2013 as one of salmon\u2019s distinctive nutritional attributes. Salmon packs more DHA and EPA omega-3s than almost any other food, apart from other fatty fish such as herring and sardines.\nStudies have consistently linked the consumption of omega-3 fatty acids from seafood to lower rates of stroke and heart disease. Research suggests these fatty acids reduce arterial stiffness associated with high blood pressure. They may also have anti-inflammatory effects that could protect against obesity and Type 2 diabetes.\nDr Mozaffarian said that omega-3s are essential to early life brain development, and emerging evidence suggests that consuming them regularly may guard against age-related cognitive decline and neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer\u2019s.\nWhile the human body is able to make some DHA and EPA on its own, eating foods high in these omega-3s can help ensure the body and brain get what they need, he said.\nThe American Heart Association recommends eating\nan 85g\nserving of fish \u2013 particularly fatty fish, such as salmon \u2013 at least twice a week.\nWhile many supplements contain omega-3s, there is evidence that getting these fats from seafood may be superior, perhaps because there are compounds in fish meat that help prevent omega-3s from breaking down during digestion.\nExperts also say that salmon contains other nutrients \u2013 such as protein, selenium and iodide \u2013 that may support or augment the healthy effects of these fats.\n\u201cThe focus is usually on omega-3s, but it\u2019s the whole package that makes salmon so healthy,\u201d said Dr Matthew Sprague, a lecturer in nutrition at the University of Stirling Institute of Aquaculture in the United Kingdom.\nIs one type healthier than another?\n\u201cThere are so many different options in the marketplace, it can be confusing,\u201d said Dr Stefanie Colombo, an associate professor and research chair in aquaculture nutrition at Dalhousie University in Canada.\nIn an attempt to clear up some of that confusion,\nshe\nexamined the nutritional values of the types of salmon available to consumers. \u201cThe main finding of our work was that there\u2019s not much difference between wild and farmed,\u201d she said.\nSalmon packs more DHA and EPA omega-3s than almost any other food, apart from other fatty fish such as herring and sardines.\nPHOTO: NYTIMES\nWhile wild sockeye and wild chinook were the most \u201cnutrient dense\u201d, her study also found that farmed Atlantic salmon had only slightly lower levels of omega-3s, proteins and other healthful nutrients.\nPink salmon tended to have less of these nutrients than the other types, regardless if they were farmed or wild.\nThe nutritional figures in Dr Colombo\u2019s study were averages, however.\nDepending on factors such as the type of feed given to farmed salmon or the time of year a wild salmon is caught, she said, the levels of healthy fats or other nutrients can differ from fish to fish.\nShe\nadded that \u201call the salmon we looked at were very nutritious\u201d.\nWhat about mercury and other contaminants?\nMore on this Topic\nSelling fresh salmon from a farm built in a factory in New York\nUS conservationists, farmers unite to protect salmon habitat\nDr Colombo said her paper did find some differences. Farmed Atlantic salmon, for example, tended to have lower mercury levels than wild-caught varieties.\nHowever, all the samples contained levels of mercury far below international safety standards. \u201cEven if you ate salmon every day, mercury is not something you should be concerned about,\u201d she said.\nThe same can be said for polychlorinated biphenyls and other contaminants that sometimes turn up in seafood.\nResearch has found that salmon, whether wild or farmed, does not contain harmful levels of these toxins. That is partly because it does not live long enough to absorb a lot of them, Dr Mozaffarian said.\nFor those concerned about the ecological impact of their food choices, salmon comes with some baggage. The overfishing of wild species and farming-related pollutants are concerns.\nBut experts said that all types of salmon outperform most animal sources of protein, in terms of environmental footprint.\nWhen buying salmon, Dr Colombo recommended looking for label certifications from the Marine Stewardship Council or Best Aquaculture Practices.\n\u201cIf the salmon is certified, that should give you more confidence it has been sustainably and ethically sourced,\u201d she said.\nAbove all, the experts affirmed that all salmon is good for you, and agonising over a choice is not necessary. \u201cAssuming you like the flavour, it\u2019s really the perfect fish,\u201d Dr Mozaffarian said.\nNYTIMES\nMore on this Topic\nFreshwater fish swim into trouble as climate change increases threat: IUCN\nRaising standards of coastal fish farms in S\u2019pore with tilapia, the \u2018chicken of the sea\u2019\nAlready a subscriber?&nbsp;\nLog in\nOur 12.12 Sale is here!\nStay informed with ST One Digital at $0.99/month for the first 6 months\nST One Digital Plan\n$9.90/month\n&nbsp;\n$0.99/month\nNo contract\nBilled at $0.99/month for the first 6 months, $9.90/month thereafter.
