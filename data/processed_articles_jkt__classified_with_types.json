The most significant outcome of the meeting was the adoption of the resolution on further deepening comprehensive reform to advance Chinese modernization.\nAs President Xi Jinping pointed out, reform and opening up are an ongoing endeavor rather than a task to be completed. The resolution laid out more than 300 important reform tasks across the board and overall arrangements for both economic structural reform and reforms in other areas, which shall be completed by the time the People\u2019s Republic of China celebrates its 80th anniversary in 2029.\nThe resolution sends a strong message to both domestic and international audiences that Chinese modernization has been advanced continuously through reform and opening up, and it will surely embrace broader horizons through this process.\nAs Chinese ambassador to ASEAN, I would emphasize that the resolution not only has a profound impact on the future of China, but also pools of vast opportunities for the development of ASEAN countries. It thus will open broader prospects for the China-ASEAN community\u2019s shared future.\nFirst, China\u2019s reform will help China and ASEAN achieve common development. During the past 33 years, the two parties have joined hands to pursue modernization.\nChina has been ASEAN\u2019s largest trading partner for 15 consecutive years, while ASEAN has been China\u2019s biggest trading partner for the last four years. Two-way trade increased by 10.5 percent year-on-year (yoy) in the first half of 2024. In 2023, China\u2019s investment in ASEAN increased by 44.6 percent and two-way investment has accumulated to over US$380 billion.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nThe Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) projects such as the China-Laos Railway and the Whoosh Jakarta-Bandung High-Speed Railway have helped promote regional connectivity and economic development along the line. The successful and vibrant China-ASEAN relationship has brought tremendous tangible benefits to the 2 billion people in the region.\nLooking into the future, China will leverage the strengths of its enormous market to enhance its capacity for opening up while expanding international cooperation and developing new institutions for a higher-standard open economy. This will inject more positive momentum into the development of our region and beyond.\nAccording to an International Monetary Fund study, a 1 percent increase in China\u2019s gross domestic product growth would result in an average of 0.3 percent increase in growth for other economies. ASEAN, as China\u2019s closest neighbor and major partner, could benefit even more.\nCurrently, China and ASEAN are negotiating the upgraded Free Trade Agreement 3.0. With the new trade arrangement, more and more products from ASEAN countries are to enter the Chinese market. This will also contribute to the development and prosperity of ASEAN and the well-being of its people.\nSecond, China\u2019s further reform and opening up will inject new impetus to China-ASEAN relations. The resolution outlines plans for fostering new quality productive forces, nurturing new areas for international cooperation, including next-generation information technology, artificial intelligence, aviation and aerospace, new energy, new materials, high-end equipment, biomedicine and quantum technology.\nASEAN is drafting the ASEAN Community Vision 2045 and its strategic plans, and making great efforts in developing the digital economy, green economy and blue economy, as well as other emerging industries. With more and more confluence of interests, China and ASEAN can align their strategies to explore more potential cooperation in the future.\nChina-ASEAN cooperation on clean energy has continued to expand in recent years. Chinese brands account for 67 percent of electric vehicles sold in ASEAN, contributing to the energy transition in our region.\nAs China and ASEAN forge closer economic, trade and investment relations, more local communities in ASEAN countries will enjoy bigger development opportunities. These multiple economic and social effects will further consolidate the base of China-ASEAN relations. China stands ready to explore more cutting-edge growth drivers and mutually beneficial cooperation with ASEAN countries.\nThird, China\u2019s further reform and opening up will make more contributions to regional peace, stability and prosperity. The resolution emphasizes that China remains firm in pursuing an independent foreign policy of peace and is dedicated to promoting a community with a shared future for mankind.\nChina stays committed to fully implementing the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative and the Global Civilization Initiative, and calls for an equal and orderly multipolar world and universally beneficial and inclusive economic globalization. China will continue to implement the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) in a high-quality manner and promote regional economic integration. China will continue to unleash the opportunities of BRI cooperation to further enhance regional connectivity.\nChinese modernization means peaceful development. China strives for openness, inclusiveness and win-win cooperation in promoting its relations with other countries.\nChina will continue to firmly support ASEAN centrality and contribute to ASEAN-centered regional cooperation and work hand in hand with ASEAN countries to build a closer China-ASEAN community with a shared future to realize the Asian dream of lasting peace and common modernization.\n***\nThe writer is Chinese ambassador to ASEAN\n.\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nRelated Articles\nAssad's fall in Syria exposes limits of China's Middle East diplomacy\nXi says trade war with US will have 'no winners'\nIndonesia women's team reaches first-ever AFF Cup final\nUnraveling the complexities of human security in Papua\nThe future of primary and secondary education under new minister\nRelated Article\nAssad's fall in Syria exposes limits of China's Middle East diplomacy\nXi says trade war with US will have 'no winners'\nIndonesia women's team reaches first-ever AFF Cup final\nUnraveling the complexities of human security in Papua\nThe future of primary and secondary education under new minister\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nMore in Opinion\nView more\nAcademia\nThe bottom-up wave of democratic rejuvenation\nAcademia\nPolice brutality: Fundamental problems in the institution\nAcademia\nFree trade deals increase Indonesian imports more than exports\nHighlight\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEditorial\nNarrow margin\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nThe Latest\nView more\nEconomy\nRI identifies 29 potential nuclear power plant sites\nEconomy\nChinese authorities are considering a weaker yuan as Trump trade risks loom, sources say\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia commences evacuation of 37 citizens in Damascus\nTech\nUS finalizes $6.1 billion Micron chip-making subsidy\nArchipelago\nTwo foreign visitors killed in tree collapse in Monkey Forest\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEconomy\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources\nRegulations\nBullion bank to launch in first half of next year, Airlangga says",

How to make the world a better place? We need to, first and foremost, understand where we are right now.\nPresident Xi Jinping once quoted Charles Dickens as saying, \"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.\"\nIncreasing wealth and advancing technology take human civilization to a historic high. But the harsh reality is that humanity is also in the midst of daunting challenges and risks.\nGlobal growth is sluggish. Geopolitical conflicts are flaring up. A Cold War mentality and power politics still haunts us. Climate change, food insecurity, refugee crises, major infectious diseases \u2013 these are all serious challenges that we must face together.\nWe also see tragedies in Gaza and Ukraine. What is wrong with this world? What kind of world should we build? How to build such a world?\nAs a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council and a responsible major country, China's answer is to build a community with a shared future for mankind.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nIt was pointed out at the Central Conference on Work Relating to Foreign Affairs at the end of 2023 in Beijing that building a community with a shared future for mankind was a noble goal of our major-country diplomacy with Chinese characteristics for the new era.\nChina calls for a community with a shared future for mankind. We aim to build an open, inclusive, clean and beautiful world of lasting peace, universal security and shared prosperity.\nThe pathway is through promoting global governance that features extensive consultation and joint contribution for shared benefits, for a new form of international relations. This is neither the old thinking of confrontation and alliance, nor the old path of colonization and hegemony.\nEven less, the dead end of compromise under oppression. On the contrary, this is the gateway to peaceful development.\nWe the Chinese people always support world peace for all. This is also in line with the spirit of the Asia-Africa Conference 60 years ago in Bandung, West Java. China never pursues development at the cost of others. A zero-sum game is never our choice.\nWe have never resorted to invasion or colonization to become the second-largest economy. The Belt and Road Initiative (OBOR), the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative and the Global Civilization Initiative proposed by President Xi resonate well with the international community.\nChina welcomes all to join the cause toward a community with a shared future for mankind.\nChina calls for an equal and orderly multipolar world. As President Joko \u201cJokowi\u201d Widodo stated at the Group of 20 Summit in Bali in November 2022, peace and stability are important for regional and global development.\nAs major developing countries, China and Indonesia share common goals. How to maintain peace and stability and protect every individual, every company and every country?\nChina's solution is to build an equal and orderly multipolar world, in which all countries, regardless of size, are treated as equals. Hegemonism and power politics are rejected and democracy is truly promoted in international relations.\nThe purposes and principles of the UN Charter must be observed by all, the generally universally recognized, basic norms governing international relations must be upheld by all, and true multilateralism must be practiced by all.\nChina calls for a universally beneficial and inclusive economic globalization. This is especially important for the Asia-Pacific, the most dynamic place full of economic potential.\nA universally beneficial and inclusive economic globalization is one that opposes all forms of unilateralism, protectionism and decoupling, firmly promotes trade and investment liberalization and facilitation and makes economic globalization more open, inclusive, balanced and beneficial to all.\nFor China, Indonesia and other regional countries, the implementation of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) and mutually beneficial cooperation in supply chains are all part of our efforts for a universally beneficial and inclusive economic globalization.\nAn equal and orderly multipolar world, a universally beneficial and inclusive economic globalization, and greater democracy in international relations are the features of a better world.\nCurrently, China, together with Indonesia and an increasing number of friendly countries, are building a community-shared future. The Jakarta-Bandung high-speed train (Whoosh), the Suramadu Bridge, timely vaccine assistance from China, popular electric vehicles and Mobile Legends, are all real images of the China-Indonesia community of a shared future.\nPresident Xi quoted an Indonesian proverb during the G20 Bali Summit, \"Sugarcane and lemongrass grow in dense clumps.\" China is ready to work with Indonesia to implement the important consensus reached by our two presidents to build the China-Indonesia community with a shared future, strengthen exchanges and cooperation in all fields, promote peace, stability, development and prosperity for China, Indonesia, the region and the world and deliver a community with a shared future for mankind.\n***\nThe writer is Chinese ambassador to Indonesia.\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nRelated Articles\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nMore than 100 Rohingya refugees rescued off Indonesia: UN\nBeyond BRICS rhetoric\nRevisiting Indonesia\u2019s surprising BRICS plan\nThe main economic challenges for Prabowo\u2019s government\nRelated Article\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nMore than 100 Rohingya refugees rescued off Indonesia: UN\nBeyond BRICS rhetoric\nRevisiting Indonesia\u2019s surprising BRICS plan\nThe main economic challenges for Prabowo\u2019s government\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nMore in Opinion\nView more\nAcademia\nThe bottom-up wave of democratic rejuvenation\nAcademia\nPolice brutality: Fundamental problems in the institution\nAcademia\nFree trade deals increase Indonesian imports more than exports\nHighlight\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEditorial\nNarrow margin\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nThe Latest\nView more\nEconomy\nRI identifies 29 potential nuclear power plant sites\nEconomy\nChinese authorities are considering a weaker yuan as Trump trade risks loom, sources say\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia commences evacuation of 37 citizens in Damascus\nTech\nUS finalizes $6.1 billion Micron chip-making subsidy\nArchipelago\nTwo foreign visitors killed in tree collapse in Monkey Forest\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEconomy\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources\nRegulations\nBullion bank to launch in first half of next year, Airlangga says",

(Reuters/Willy Kurniawan)\nTime rolls on just like the flow of water. On Feb. 22, 2022, I came to the \u201cnation of archipelago\u201d as the Chinese ambassador to Indonesia on a glorious mission entrusted by my government. In the blink of an eye, the time has come for me to bid farewell.\nIn the past two years, I traveled around Java, and set foot on the islands of Sumatra, Kalimantan, Sulawesi, Bali and West and East Nusa Tenggara. From the sapphire-blue sky and sea of Bali to the emerald-green mountain and water of Lake Toba, from the Komodo dragon to the orangutan, from the Mahayana reliefs of Borobudur to the statue of Zheng He in Semarang, I have been deeply impressed by Indonesia\u2019s wonderful scenery, diverse and inclusive culture, kind-hearted and hospitable people and vibrant society.\nThe past two years have been rewarding. Together with Indonesian friends from all walks of life, I have made efforts to implement the important consensus reached by Chinese and Indonesian leaders to deepen cooperation in development strategy, promote practical cooperation and expand exchanges and mutual learning.\nChina-Indonesia relations have made great strides forward, delivering fruitful outcomes from this cooperation. Both important developing countries and emerging economies, our two countries share similar goals, uphold mutual respect and strive for mutual benefit from each other\u2019s comparative strengths.\nWe work hand in hand on the path toward modernization and bring tangible benefits to our two peoples. The giant ship of the China-Indonesia community with a shared future is setting sail for a new journey.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nI am pleased to see that under the strategic guidance of our two presidents, China-Indonesia relations are at a historical high. In the past two years, President Xi Jinping made the first overseas visit to Indonesia after the 20th Communist Party of China (CPC) National Congress. President Joko \u201cJokowi\u201d Widodo visited China three times. President-elect\nPrabowo Subianto\nmade his first visit to China soon after the election.\nI am pleased to see that our two presidents have charted the course of jointly building the China-Indonesia community with a shared future, and reached a new important consensus on turning the vision into a reality. Our two sides make full use of high-level dialogue and cooperation mechanism to promote practical cooperation in all areas. The 2+2 ministerial dialogue mechanism is in place and will set to inject new momentum into our Comprehensive Strategic Partnership.\nI am pleased to see that our two countries have become the pacesetters of successful Belt and Road cooperation based on the principle of designing together, building together and benefiting together. The Jakarta-Bandung High-Speed Rail (Whoosh) makes Indonesia the only country besides China to have a 350-kilometer/hour railway.\nWhoosh not only shortens the&nbsp;travel time, but also helps upgrade the industrial structure and empower economic development along the route. The Regional Comprehensive Economic Corridor and the \u201cTwo Countries, Twin Parks\u201d move forward steadily and are expected to become new flagship projects of our Belt and Road cooperation.\nI am pleased to see that our two-way trade is over US$100 billion every year. China has been Indonesia\u2019s largest trading partner for 11 consecutive years and among Indonesia\u2019s top three sources of foreign investment for eight years in a row. Our industrial and supply chain cooperation develops by leaps and bounds, a success for both sides.\nI am pleased to see the increasing number of flights and people-to-people exchanges between the two countries in the post-COVID era. Indonesian students return to campus in China. The performance of the folk music ensemble and Xinjiang art troupe from China amazed Indonesian friends. Delegations of Indonesian religious communities paid visits to China. Chinese language training courses are now open in Istiqlal Mosque.\nThe China-Indonesia joint scientific expedition set Indonesia\u2019s deepest dive record. Indonesia is one of the first destinations for China to resume outbound group tours after the pandemic. In 2023, 707,000 Chinese tourists came to Indonesia to enjoy sea views, volcano trekking and delicious food.\nI am pleased to see that our two countries work together closely on international and regional issues with similar positions. In the past two years, Indonesia successfully hosted the Group of 20 Bali Summit and Leaders\u2019 Meetings on East Asia Cooperation as the chair of the G20 and ASEAN. China fully supported Indonesia in fulfilling its duties. China appreciates Indonesia\u2019s support for the Global Development Initiative and its positive response to the Global Security Initiative and Global Civilization Initiative, and is ready to work with Indonesia to take the initiatives forward.\nChanges in the world, of our times and of historical significance are unfolding like never before, and the world has entered a new period of turbulence and transformation. Yet the overall direction of human development and progress will not change, the overall dynamics of world history moving forward amid twists and turns will not change and the overall trend toward a shared future for the international community will not change.\nAs long as China and Indonesia focus on building the community with a shared future, continue to promote high-quality Belt and Road cooperation, call for an equal and orderly multi-polar world and universally beneficial and inclusive economic globalization, respond to global challenges together and strive to achieve common prosperity, the bilateral relations will surely get better day by day. Our respective development goals will surely be achieved and we will surely have an even brighter future.\nAs an Indonesian proverb goes, \u201cMoney is easy to get, but friends are hard to find.\u201d I am glad that in the past two years, I have had the opportunity to get to know friends from the Indonesian government, political parties, parliament, business, religious and overseas Chinese communities, think tanks and media, other diplomatic missions in Indonesia and Chinese entrepreneurs, press and teachers. Thank you all for your valuable contributions to China-Indonesia relations and strong support for the work of the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia, and myself in particular.\nWords are never enough for bidding farewell. I will start a new journey with beautiful memories and deep friendships from Indonesia. And I will continue to follow the development of China-Indonesia relations and be an envoy of friendship between our two countries.\nMay China and Indonesia enjoy prosperity and the people\u2019s happiness. May China-Indonesia relations reach greater heights. May all our Indonesian friends enjoy good health.\n***\nThe writer is Chinese ambassador to Indonesia.\n&nbsp;\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nRelated Articles\nIndonesia\u2019s tourist sector: A new era of innovation and growth\nPhilippines agrees to transfer proposal for prisoner Mary Jane Veloso\nIndonesia should think twice about joining BRICS and OECD\nChina to curbs exports of key chipmaking components to US\nSemarang police shoot student allegedly involved in gang brawl\nRelated Article\nIndonesia\u2019s tourist sector: A new era of innovation and growth\nPhilippines agrees to transfer proposal for prisoner Mary Jane Veloso\nIndonesia should think twice about joining BRICS and OECD\nChina to curbs exports of key chipmaking components to US\nSemarang police shoot student allegedly involved in gang brawl\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nMore in Opinion\nView more\nAcademia\nThe bottom-up wave of democratic rejuvenation\nAcademia\nPolice brutality: Fundamental problems in the institution\nAcademia\nFree trade deals increase Indonesian imports more than exports\nHighlight\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEditorial\nNarrow margin\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nThe Latest\nView more\nTech\nUS finalizes $6.1 billion Micron chip-making subsidy\nArchipelago\nTwo foreign visitors killed in tree collapse in Monkey Forest\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEconomy\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources\nRegulations\nBullion bank to launch in first half of next year, Airlangga says\nMiddle East and Africa\nAirline pilots, crews voice concerns about Middle East routes\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nRegulations\nEY worker's death spotlights India's unprotected white-collar labor",

(Reuters/Willy Kurniawan)\nAt the invitation of President Xi Jinping, Indonesian President\nPrabowo Subianto\nwill begin a state visit to China tomorrow. Following his first overseas visit to China last April after the election, President Prabowo also chose China as the destination for his first visit after inauguration.\nThese two \"firsts\" reflect President Prabowo's friendship with China, and fully demonstrate the depth of the China-Indonesia Comprehensive Strategic Partnership. We hope and believe that this visit will further accelerate the fast-growing bilateral relations, upgrade practical cooperation in all fields and start a new journey toward the China-Indonesia community with a shared future.\nOver the past decade, our two presidents exchanged visits multiple times, having more than 10 meetings and phone calls. During President Prabowo\u2019s visit to China last April, President Xi and President Prabowo reached important consensus on deepening all-round strategic cooperation and building a China-Indonesia community with a shared future with regional and global influence.\nThe Chinese Embassy in Indonesia and the Indonesian team are working hard to implement the consensus. During this upcoming visit, President Xi will meet with President Prabowo to exchange views on significant issues regarding China-Indonesia relations.\nWe will work with the Indonesian side to implement the important consensus, continue to support each other firmly on issues related to our core interests and major concerns, elevate our comprehensive strategic partnership to new heights and make the building the China-Indonesia community with a shared future more substantive.\nIndonesia, where the \u201c21st Century Maritime Silk Road\u201d was raised, has left a distinctive \"Indonesian mark\" on the Belt and Road Initiative. Whoosh, as a flagship project of high-quality Belt and Road cooperation, has become a landmark of China-Indonesia mutually beneficial cooperation.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nSince its commencing over a year ago, Whoosh has carried more than 6 million passengers, with an average daily ridership of about 15,800 and a maximum daily seat occupancy rate of 99.6 percent.&nbsp; The name of the train, the high-speed \u201cWhoosh\u201d sound, is a testimony to Indonesian friends\u2019 recognition of the speed, efficiency and safety it offers.\nFor 11 consecutive years, China has been Indonesia's largest trading partner, with bilateral trade reaching US$139.42 billion in 2023. Both sides have made continuous progress in cooperation in minerals, industrial parks, digital economy, photovoltaic and electric vehicles (EVs).\nPeople-to-people exchanges are also a highlight. In 2023, nearly 790,000 Chinese tourists visited Indonesia, exploring volcanoes, islands and local cuisines. In the first half of 2024, the number reached around 570,000, making China one of Indonesia\u2019s most significant tourist source countries.\nWe look forward to reaching new important consensus on practical cooperation across various fields, creating more highlights out of win-win cooperation and contributing to Indonesia\u2019s economic and social development and the well-being of its people, thus enhancing the sense of gaining of both peoples in the China-Indonesia community with a shared future.\nAs key members of the Global South and emerging economies, China and Indonesia firmly uphold the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and promote the Bandung Spirit of unity, friendship and cooperation set forth in the 1955 Asia-Africa Conference.\nWe work closely together in international and regional affairs, advancing China-ASEAN cooperation, maintaining peace and stability in the South China Sea, supporting the Palestinian national liberation cause and defending the common interests of the Global South. Such cooperation highlights the nature of the pursuit of peace, development, fairness and justice in our bilateral relations.\nWe look forward to reaching new consensus on closer multilateral coordination, maintaining ASEAN centrality and strengthening coordination and cooperation in the United Nations, BRICS, the Group of 20, Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) and other multilateral fora, so as to jointly advance global governance reforms, showcase the responsibility of major developing nations and highlight the global significance of the China-Indonesia community with a shared future.\nOver the years, China\u2019s growth rate has been among the top in major economies, contributing about 30 percent global growth. In the first three quarters of 2024, China\u2019s economy grew by 4.8 percent.\nWe continue to expand high-level opening-up, being the world\u2019s second-largest recipient of foreign investment for three consecutive years. We are shortening the negative list for foreign investment and have eliminated all restrictions on foreign investment in the manufacturing sector.\nChina is accelerating technological innovation and green transformation, ranking 11th in the 2024 global innovation index. Its wind and solar energy products help reduce global emissions by 2.83 billion tonnes.\nChina is also actively expanding its network of high-standard free trade areas globally, signing 22 free trade agreements with 29 countries and regions. Trade with over 160 countries and regions, including Indonesia, keeps growing.\nChina's economy is scaling new heights and is full of potential. China will contribute more certainty and positive energy to the steady development of global economy, providing new opportunities for the development of all countries.\nThe China-Indonesia relationship has already embarked on a new journey. The blueprint is drawn, and the action is imminent. We are confident that, under the strategic guidance of our two presidents, the ship of China-Indonesia friendship will overcome all challenges and sail forward.\n***\nThe writer is Chinese ambassador to Indonesia.\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nRelated Articles\nFree trade deals increase Indonesian imports more than exports\nPresident Prabowo should make Indonesia a global champion of democracy\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nIndonesia should think twice about joining BRICS and OECD\nEurope\u2019s economy is stalling out\nRelated Article\nFree trade deals increase Indonesian imports more than exports\nPresident Prabowo should make Indonesia a global champion of democracy\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nIndonesia should think twice about joining BRICS and OECD\nEurope\u2019s economy is stalling out\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nMore in Opinion\nView more\nAcademia\nThe bottom-up wave of democratic rejuvenation\nAcademia\nPolice brutality: Fundamental problems in the institution\nAcademia\nFree trade deals increase Indonesian imports more than exports\nHighlight\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEditorial\nNarrow margin\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nThe Latest\nView more\nEconomy\nRI identifies 29 potential nuclear power plant sites\nEconomy\nChinese authorities are considering a weaker yuan as Trump trade risks loom, sources say\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia commences evacuation of 37 citizens in Damascus\nTech\nUS finalizes $6.1 billion Micron chip-making subsidy\nArchipelago\nTwo foreign visitors killed in tree collapse in Monkey Forest\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEconomy\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources\nRegulations\nBullion bank to launch in first half of next year, Airlangga says",

(Antara/KCIC)\nC\nhina on Tuesday unveiled its blueprint for a better world, raised by President Xi Jinping in 2013, through a policy paper on building a global community of shared future.\nChina also said it will continue to push for green development in Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) projects, rejecting accusations that it has outsourced its environmental pollution, a senior official from China\u2019s top economic planner said at a press conference on the wide-ranging policy paper about China\u2019s global vision.\nThe White Paper titled \u201cA Global Community of Shared Future: China\u2019s Proposals and Actions\u201d comes a decade after the vision was first proposed by Xi, and has been presented as his alternative to the current Western-led world order, with an emphasis on what it calls Chinese-style diplomacy and various global initiatives.\nThis year also marks the 10th anniversary of the BRI, and China will host the third Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation in October, with leaders and representatives from some 130 countries set to attend, including Russian President Vladimir Putin.\nBy July 2023, more than three-quarters of countries in the world and over 30 international organizations had signed agreements on Belt and Road cooperation with China, the White Paper said.\nIssued by the State Council Information Office, the White Paper said the vision rises above the exclusive rules of bloc politics, the notion of \u201cmight makes right\u201d and the \u201cuniversal values\u201d defined by a handful of Western countries.\nChina has contributed to building a global community of shared future with actions including promoting high-quality Belt and Road cooperation, state news agency Xinhua said on Tuesday.\nAt the press conference, in a rare appearance beyond his usual annual press conference in March, Foreign Minister Wang Yi said that by putting forward the creative idea, President Xi has shown \u201cthe correct path for the world\u201d, building a strong consensus for international cooperation.\nChina has also proposed solutions to major global challenges in fields such as health, climate change and cyber security, Wang added.\nHe said Beijing was willing to play a \u201cconstructive\u201d role in the success of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in November in San Francisco, US.\nIt paves the way for a possible meeting between Xi and US President Joe Biden \u2013 both presidents last met on the sidelines of the Group of 20 (G20) leaders\u2019 summit in November 2022 in Bali.\nXi did not attend the G20 summit in India earlier this month, missing an opportunity to meet Biden, and prompting the US to say China was \u201cgiving up\u201d on the G20 and building an alternative world order.\n\u201cOf course, we and all parties also hope that the United States will realize its responsibilities as a host, show due openness, fairness, tolerance and responsibility, and create better conditions for the smooth holding of the meeting,\u201d Wang said, referring to the APEC&nbsp;summit.\nEarlier on Tuesday, Hong Kong Chief Executive John Lee said he had yet to receive any invitation to the November meeting. It follows US media reports in July that he had been barred from the meetings after being sanctioned by Washington for what it calls his role in cracking down on civil liberties in the Asian financial hub.\nWang repeated a frequent Chinese warning that China opposes \u201cwanton expansion of military alliances\u201d and the squeezing of the security space of other countries.\nBeijing has been critical of Washington\u2019s continued attempts to increase military cooperation in the Indo-Pacific region, including the Quad and the AUKUS&nbsp;groupings. It particularly disagrees with bases that are being built by the US in the north of the Philippines.\nDialogue between China and the US has been gradually resuming despite continued tensions, with several high-level visits to Beijing in recent months by top US officials, including Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo.\nMeanwhile, not all is rosy with China\u2019s BRI, which has come under widespread criticism for causing environmental destruction in project areas, including building coal-fired power plants overseas despite a national commitment domestically to reach peak carbon output by 2030, and to be carbon-neutral by 2060.\nEarlier this year,\na report\nin\nThe Jakarta Post\nsaid the Batang Toru hydropower project, which is 70 percent owned by Chinese-owned State Development and Investment Corporation\u2019s subsidiary SDIC Power, encroached on the habitat of the endangered Tapanuli orangutan, forcing them to intrude on nearby farms and villages.\nRead also:\nChina\u2019s big firms put reputation at risk in Batang Toru power plant\n\u201cThe joint construction of the \u2018Belt and Road\u2019 projects are carried out based on the principle of extensive consultation, joint construction and shared benefits,\u201d Cong Liang, deputy director of the National Development and Reform Commission said in response to a question from\nThe Straits Times\nat the press conference.\n\u201cWhether the development is green or not, I think the [partner country]&nbsp;knows best, the local people have the most say, and facts are always more convincing than words.\u201d\nIt is \u201cnot worth refuting\u201d the voices that slander the Green Silk Road \u2013 an initiative to make BRI projects more ecologically sustainable \u2013 and those who attempt to smear and interfere with joint projects will not succeed, he added.\nTouting the success of the BRI, officials said projects such as\nthe high-speed rail between Jakarta and Bandung\n, the Phnom Penh-Sihanoukville Expressway, and the Greek port of Piraeus have increased connectivity, rejuvenating the local economy with jobs and trade.\n\u201cIn the next step, the NDRC will work with relevant departments\u2026 (and) continue to build high-quality landmark projects, promote \u2018small but beautiful\u2019 projects, deepen cooperation in key areas such as infrastructure and people\u2019s livelihood projects to achieve complementary advantages, mutual benefits and win-win results,\u201d Cong said.\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nRelated Articles\nAssad's fall in Syria exposes limits of China's Middle East diplomacy\nChina lifts final bans on Australian red meat as trade row nears end\nBiden out of the picture as world leaders meet\nXi, Biden attend APEC summit, prepare to meet\nPeru's Chancay: China's megaport of entry to South America\nRelated Article\nAssad's fall in Syria exposes limits of China's Middle East diplomacy\nChina lifts final bans on Australian red meat as trade row nears end\nBiden out of the picture as world leaders meet\nXi, Biden attend APEC summit, prepare to meet\nPeru's Chancay: China's megaport of entry to South America\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nMore in World\nView more\nMiddle East and Africa\nAirline pilots, crews voice concerns about Middle East routes\nAmericas\nLula 'stable' after emergency surgery\nAsia &amp; Pacific\nSouth Korea police raid president's office\nHighlight\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEditorial\nNarrow margin\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nThe Latest\nView more\nTech\nUS finalizes $6.1 billion Micron chip-making subsidy\nArchipelago\nTwo foreign visitors killed in tree collapse in Monkey Forest\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEconomy\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources\nRegulations\nBullion bank to launch in first half of next year, Airlangga says\nMiddle East and Africa\nAirline pilots, crews voice concerns about Middle East routes\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nRegulations\nEY worker's death spotlights India's unprotected white-collar labor",

Essentially, it serves as both a decade's report card and a visionary roadmap for the future of Belt and Road collaboration. From its ambitious inception to its execution, the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) has surpassed its early projections in remarkable ways over the past decade.\nIn terms of geographic reach, the BRI has garnered participation from more than 150 countries and over 30 international organizations, accounting for almost 75 percent of the world's population. Across the spectrum of its engagement, the BRI extends its influence into a diverse array of domains, spanning economics, culture, and ecology.\nWhether we're talking about the hard connectivity of land-based roads and sea routes, the soft connectivity entailing collaborative efforts to enhance rules and standards, or the people-to-people connectivity in various arenas like education, culture, sports, tourism, and archaeology, the BRI has woven a sprawling network of cooperation and shared gains across the world.\nThe BRI marked a defining moment in China's global involvement, signifying its ascent to a prominent position on the world platform. Throughout the past decade, it has ushered in a transformative era, leaving an indelible imprint on the global terrain and underscoring its far-reaching influence across the world.\nNumerous flagship projects, such as the Mombasa-Nairobi railway, the China-Laos railway, and the Jakarta-Bandung high-speed railway, are completed and operational. These milestones are poised to give a significant boost to emerging economies.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nAccording to World Bank estimates, by the year 2030, the BRI is expected to generate a staggering US$1.6 trillion in annual global revenue, equivalent to 1.3 percent of the global GDP. As this network of transport corridors and economic hubs continues to expand, there is immense potential for enhancing trade, spurring investment, and improving the quality of life for countless citizens across participating nations.\nSince the initiation of the BRI, the aspiration of forging a community with a shared future has evolved from mere conceptualization to concrete action and from visionary idealism to tangible achievement. An increasing number of nations have come to appreciate China's assertion that development is not the exclusive privilege of a select few Western countries, but rather an inherent right accessible to all nations.\nThe BRI has orchestrated a profound transformation on the world stage for five compelling reasons. First, it has elevated the discourse on development to a pivotal global concern. Second, it has fostered an unprecedented bond between China and developing nations.\nThird, it has paved the path toward a fresh global realignment and, by extension, a novel paradigm of global politics. Fourth, it has disseminated the fundamental tenets of Chinese philosophy on a global scale.\nLastly, it has given rise to a novel breed of international institution, offering a tantalizing glimpse into a world order where the welfare of the majority takes precedence over the interests of the few\u2014a truly remarkable reimagining of global dynamics.\nAlthough the initial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic temporarily slowed its progress, the BRI has since bounced back with renewed vigor as the world slowly returns to a semblance of normalcy. This resilience serves as a testament to the BRI's remarkable adaptability in the face of ever-shifting global conditions. Indeed, the BRI stands as a sturdy and agile force, mirroring the ever-changing contours of the world it engages with.\nA curious phenomenon emerges when we examine the spectrum of countries engaged in the BRI. Developing nations consistently exhibit a favorable stance toward BRI collaboration, whereas the sentiment among developed countries is not uniformly enthusiastic. It is essential to acknowledge that developing countries often bear more significant development burdens.\nNevertheless, it is important to note that the BRI's inclusive ethos extends to all nations, with a desire for the participation of as many countries as possible, including those that are more developed.\nEver since 2013 when China launched its magnanimous BRI, Western capitals have been viewing this monumental developmental project with skepticism; their response is tainted by an unwarranted wave of negativity and misinformation. It is quite evident that certain think tanks and media in the West, particularly within the United States, harbor certain political biases when it comes to their assessments of the BRI.\nIt is common to find these studies riddled with allegations of so-called debt traps, complaints of a lack of transparency and concerns about the environmental impact. It seems as though there is a concerted effort to cast a shadow over this monumental endeavor.\nThe BRI is not merely a vehicle for China's economic growth but a pathway to shared prosperity. It aims to bridge regional divides, boost trade, and foster sustainable development across Asia, Europe, Latin America and Africa.\nFrom 2013 to 2022, China's trade with BRI participant nations has surged to a whopping $19.1 trillion, marked by an annual growth rate averaging 6.4 percent. Impressively, the cumulative two-way investment between China and its partner countries has reached $380 billion, with China contributing $240 billion, as revealed in the white paper.\nThese numbers illuminate the transformative impact of the BRI, both as a catalyst for trade and as a source of significant investment in the participating nations, underscoring its pivotal role in shaping global economic dynamics.\nThe future of BRI cooperation is rich with possibilities. As highlighted in the white paper, the BRI is a profound, long-term, and systematic global endeavor of the 21st century, and it has embarked on an enduring journey. The original framework of BRI, while primarily focusing on partnerships with developing nations, has become the bedrock upon which the Global Development Initiative, Global Security Initiative, and Global Civilization Initiative have flourished.\nThese progressive offshoots represent an intentional expansion of the initial vision, offering a wide array of dynamic approaches to fortify global development and the accomplishments of the BRI.\nAs traditional infrastructure projects persist, the rising prominence of digital connectivity is set to drive substantial demand for digital infrastructure across the region. This digital frontier is poised to assume a central role in the next phase of BRI implementation.\nConcurrently, the green and blue economies are poised to emerge as twin drivers. These multifaceted developments paint a promising picture for growth, collaboration and shared prosperity.\n&nbsp;***\nThe writer is an international affairs observer based in Karachi.\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nRelated Articles\nGovt expects Apple to up investment commitment to $1 billion\nGovt halts big infrastructure in trade-off for food security: Minister\nMeaningful digital transformation for the Asia-Pacific region\nFor Indonesia, Trumponomics will be another headwind\nLiquidity challenges and growth expectations in the new government era\nRelated Article\nGovt expects Apple to up investment commitment to $1 billion\nGovt halts big infrastructure in trade-off for food security: Minister\nMeaningful digital transformation for the Asia-Pacific region\nFor Indonesia, Trumponomics will be another headwind\nLiquidity challenges and growth expectations in the new government era\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nMore in Opinion\nView more\nAcademia\nThe bottom-up wave of democratic rejuvenation\nAcademia\nPolice brutality: Fundamental problems in the institution\nAcademia\nFree trade deals increase Indonesian imports more than exports\nHighlight\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEditorial\nNarrow margin\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nThe Latest\nView more\nTech\nUS finalizes $6.1 billion Micron chip-making subsidy\nArchipelago\nTwo foreign visitors killed in tree collapse in Monkey Forest\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEconomy\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources\nRegulations\nBullion bank to launch in first half of next year, Airlangga says\nMiddle East and Africa\nAirline pilots, crews voice concerns about Middle East routes\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nRegulations\nEY worker's death spotlights India's unprotected white-collar labor",

This was President Xi Jinping\u2019s farsighted initiative for us to revisit these principles and how they are still useful in facing future challenges.\nThe Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence was a seminal proposal by Zhou Enlai and Jawaharlal Nehru, the respective prime ministers of China and India at the time. The fundamental tenet of this proposal is mutual respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all parties involved.\nFurthermore, it calls for a mutual nonaggression, noninterference in each other's internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit. Finally, it advocates for peaceful coexistence.\nThese enlightened principles encapsulated the wisdom of the two world's greatest and most ancient civilizations.\nThis year we also celebrate the 11th anniversary since China introduced the concept of Building a Community with a Shared Future for Mankind, which was first articulated by President Xi in 2013 and represents a modern approach to global governance and cooperation.\nIt emphasizes the interconnection of nations in an increasingly globalized world and advocates mutual respect, mutual benefit and win-win cooperation. At its core, the concept seeks to address the common challenges facing humanity, such as climate change, poverty and pandemics.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nThe two initiatives, though originating from different contexts and regions, share a common aspiration for global harmony, cooperation and progress.

(Reuters/Florence Lo)\nP\nresident\nPrabowo Subianto\n\u2019s inaugural visit to China underscores a pivot toward great power diplomacy, a strategic approach that may mark a significant departure from Indonesia\u2019s traditional stance more closely resembling what is now referred to and discussed as \u201cmiddle power diplomacy.\u201d\nOver the weekend, Prabowo met with key Chinese leaders, including Zhao Leji, chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Premier Li Qiang, and finally, President Xi Jinping. The visit yielded several notable agreements, such as a US$10 billion investment pledge between the countries and several memorandums of understanding related to water conservation, the blue economy and maritime resources, and mining.\nThe joint statement issued by the leaders, titled \u201cPromoting Comprehensive Strategic Partnership and Building a China-Indonesia Community with a Shared Future\u201d, reflects Prabowo\u2019s strategic framing of China as an essential partner.\nFrom the various statements expressed by Prabowo, we can take a glimpse of how he stressed a multipolar world order, guided by principles like strategic autonomy, mutual trust, fairness and win-win cooperation.\nSuch a worldview indeed reflects the argument of the erosion of moral leadership by the very pole that has led the current global order, the United States, from unilateral protectionist policies, lack of appetite for all things multilateral, all the way to the moral quandary in the conflict in the Middle East.\nYet one aspect of this trip has raised concerns both domestically and internationally.

It aims to bridge regional divides, boost trade, and foster sustainable development across Asia, Europe, Latin America and Africa.\nFrom 2013 to 2022, China's trade with BRI participant nations has surged to a whopping $19.1 trillion, marked by an annual growth rate averaging 6.4 percent. Impressively, the cumulative two-way investment between China and its partner countries has reached $380 billion, with China contributing $240 billion, as revealed in the white paper.\nThese numbers illuminate the transformative impact of the BRI, both as a catalyst for trade and as a source of significant investment in the participating nations, underscoring its pivotal role in shaping global economic dynamics.\nThe future of BRI cooperation is rich with possibilities. As highlighted in the white paper, the BRI is a profound, long-term, and systematic global endeavor of the 21st century, and it has embarked on an enduring journey. The original framework of BRI, while primarily focusing on partnerships with developing nations, has become the bedrock upon which the Global Development Initiative, Global Security Initiative, and Global Civilization Initiative have flourished.\nThese progressive offshoots represent an intentional expansion of the initial vision, offering a wide array of dynamic approaches to fortify global development and the accomplishments of the BRI.\nAs traditional infrastructure projects persist, the rising prominence of digital connectivity is set to drive substantial demand for digital infrastructure across the region. This digital frontier is poised to assume a central role in the next phase of BRI implementation.\nConcurrently, the green and blue economies are poised to emerge as twin drivers. These multifaceted developments paint a promising picture for growth, collaboration and shared prosperity.\n&nbsp;***\nThe writer is an international affairs observer based in Karachi.\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nRelated Articles\nGovt expects Apple to up investment commitment to $1 billion\nGovt halts big infrastructure in trade-off for food security: Minister\nMeaningful digital transformation for the Asia-Pacific region\nFor Indonesia, Trumponomics will be another headwind\nLiquidity challenges and growth expectations in the new government era\nRelated Article\nGovt expects Apple to up investment commitment to $1 billion\nGovt halts big infrastructure in trade-off for food security: Minister\nMeaningful digital transformation for the Asia-Pacific region\nFor Indonesia, Trumponomics will be another headwind\nLiquidity challenges and growth expectations in the new government era\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nMore in Opinion\nView more\nAcademia\nThe bottom-up wave of democratic rejuvenation\nAcademia\nPolice brutality: Fundamental problems in the institution\nAcademia\nFree trade deals increase Indonesian imports more than exports\nHighlight\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEditorial\nNarrow margin\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nThe Latest\nView more\nEconomy\nRI identifies 29 potential nuclear power plant sites\nEconomy\nChinese authorities are considering a weaker yuan as Trump trade risks loom, sources say\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia commences evacuation of 37 citizens in Damascus\nTech\nUS finalizes $6.1 billion Micron chip-making subsidy\nArchipelago\nTwo foreign visitors killed in tree collapse in Monkey Forest\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEconomy\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources\nRegulations\nBullion bank to launch in first half of next year, Airlangga says",

REUTERS/Adnan Abidi (Reuters/ADNAN ABIDI)\nVersi Bahasa Indonesia\n\u201c\nVasudhaiva Kutumbakam\u201d\n\u2013 these two words capture a deep philosophy. It means \u201cthe world is one family\u201d. This is an all-embracing outlook that encourages us to progress as one universal family, transcending borders, languages, and ideologies.\nDuring India\u2019s Group of 20 presidency, this has translated into a call for human-centric progress. As one Earth, we are coming together to nurture our planet. As one family, we support each other in the pursuit of growth. And we move together towards a shared future \u2013 one future \u2013 which is an undeniable truth in these interconnected times.\nThe post-pandemic world order is very different from the world before it. There are three important changes, among others.\nFirst, there is a growing realization that a shift away from a gross domestic product (GDP)-centric view of the world to a human-centric view is needed.&nbsp;\nSecond, the world is recognizing the importance of resilience and reliability in global supply chains.\nThird, there is a collective call for boosting multilateralism through the reform of global institutions.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nOur G20 presidency has played the role of a catalyst in these shifts.&nbsp;\nIn December 2022, when we took over the presidency from Indonesia, I had written that a mindset shift must be catalyzed by the G20. This was especially needed in the context of mainstreaming the marginalized aspirations of developing countries, the Global South and Africa.\nThe Voice of Global South Summit, which witnessed participation from 125 countries, was one of the foremost initiatives under our presidency. It was an important exercise to gather inputs and ideas from the Global South. Further, our presidency has not only seen the largest-ever participation from African countries but has also pushed for the inclusion of the African Union as a permanent member of the G20.\nAn interconnected world means our challenges across domains are interlinked. This is the midway year of the 2030 Agenda and many are noting with great concern that the progress on Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is off-track. The G20 2023 Action Plan on Accelerating Progress on SDGs will spearhead the future direction of the G20 toward implementing SDGs.\nIn India, living in harmony with nature has been a norm since ancient times and we have been contributing our share towards climate action even in modern times.&nbsp;\nMany countries of the Global South are at various stages of development and climate action must be a complementary pursuit. Ambitions for climate action must be matched with actions on climate finance and the transfer of technology.&nbsp;\nWe believe there is a need to move away from a purely restrictive attitude of what should not be done, to a more constructive attitude focusing on what can be done to fight climate change.\nThe Chennai HLPs for a Sustainable and Resilient Blue Economy focus on keeping our oceans healthy.&nbsp;\nA global ecosystem for clean and green hydrogen will emerge from our presidency, along with a Green Hydrogen Innovation Centre.\nIn 2015, we launched the International Solar Alliance. Now, through the Global Biofuels Alliance, we will support the world to enable energy transitions in tune with the benefits of a circular economy.\nDemocratizing climate action is the best way to impart momentum to the movement. Just as individuals make daily decisions based on their long-term health, they can make lifestyle decisions based on the impact on the planet\u2019s long-term health. Just like yoga became a global mass movement for wellness, we have also nudged the world with Lifestyles for Sustainable Environment (LiFE).\nDue to the impact of climate change, ensuring food and nutritional security will be crucial. Millets, or\nShree Anna\n, can help with this while also boosting climate-smart agriculture. In the International Year of Millets, we have taken millets to global palates. The Deccan High Level Principles on Food Security and Nutrition is also helpful in this direction.\nTechnology is transformative but it also needs to be made inclusive. In the past, the benefits of technological advancements have not benefited all sections of society equally. India, over the last few years, has shown how technology can be leveraged to narrow inequalities, rather than widen them.&nbsp;\nFor instance, the billions across the world that remain unbanked, or lack digital identities, can be financially included through digital public infrastructure (DPI). The solutions we have built using our DPI have now been recognized globally. Now, through the G20, we will help developing countries adapt, build, and scale DPI to unlock the power of inclusive growth.\nThat India is the fastest-growing large economy is no accident. Our simple, scalable and sustainable solutions have empowered the vulnerable and the marginalized to lead our development story. From space to sports, economy to entrepreneurship, Indian women have taken the lead in various sectors. They have shifted the narrative from the development of women to women-led development. Our G20 presidency is working on bridging the gender digital divide, reducing labor force participation gaps and enabling a larger role for women in leadership and decision-making.\nFor India, the G20 presidency is not merely a high-level diplomatic endeavor. As the mother of democracy and a model of diversity, we opened the doors of this experience to the world.\nToday, accomplishing things at scale is a quality that is associated with India. The G20 presidency is no exception. It has become a people-driven movement. Over 200 meetings will have been organized in 60 Indian cities across the length and breadth of our nation, hosting nearly 100,000 delegates from 125 countries by the end of our term. No presidency has ever encompassed such a vast and diverse geographical expanse.\nIt is one thing to hear about India\u2019s demography, democracy, diversity and development from someone else. It is totally different to experience them first-hand. I am sure our G20 delegates would vouch for this.\nOur G20 presidency strives to bridge divides, dismantle barriers, and sow seeds of collaboration that nourish a world where unity prevails over discord, where shared destiny eclipses isolation. As the G20 president, we had pledged to make the global table larger, ensuring that every voice is heard and every country contributes.\nI am positive that we have matched our pledge with actions and outcomes.\n&nbsp;***\nThe writer is Prime Minister of India.\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nRelated Articles\nThe fall and rise of American democracy\nIs the G77 the future of multilateralism?\nHealing our planet is now restoration, not just conservation\nRevolutionizing digitalization: The key to transforming Indonesia into a developed nation\nAfrican leaders in Beijing eyeing big loans and investment\nRelated Article\nThe fall and rise of American democracy\nIs the G77 the future of multilateralism?\nHealing our planet is now restoration, not just conservation\nRevolutionizing digitalization: The key to transforming Indonesia into a developed nation\nAfrican leaders in Beijing eyeing big loans and investment\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nMore in Opinion\nView more\nAcademia\nThe bottom-up wave of democratic rejuvenation\nAcademia\nPolice brutality: Fundamental problems in the institution\nAcademia\nFree trade deals increase Indonesian imports more than exports\nHighlight\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEditorial\nNarrow margin\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nThe Latest\nView more\nEconomy\nRI identifies 29 potential nuclear power plant sites\nEconomy\nChinese authorities are considering a weaker yuan as Trump trade risks loom, sources say\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia commences evacuation of 37 citizens in Damascus\nTech\nUS finalizes $6.1 billion Micron chip-making subsidy\nArchipelago\nTwo foreign visitors killed in tree collapse in Monkey Forest\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEconomy\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources\nRegulations\nBullion bank to launch in first half of next year, Airlangga says",

(Reuters/China Daily)\nNo one should underestimate the importance of president-elect\nPrabowo Subianto\n's visit to China and Japan this week.\nHis meetings with Chinese President Xi Jinping and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida demonstrate his intent to maintain an economic-heavy foreign policy but also to infuse global security and defense perspectives amid the growing tension between China and the United States.\nLike many other countries, including even some in the developed world, Indonesia cannot avoid a heavy dependence on China for trade, investment and government-to-government economic cooperation. Prabowo knows this and he has chosen to piggyback on Jokowi and Xi's personal relationship.\nPrabowo achieved a major diplomatic coup by securing a bilateral meeting with&nbsp;Xi, the supreme leader of the world's second-largest economy and Indonesia\u2019s most important economic partner.&nbsp;&nbsp;\nThe meeting with Kishida should also be seen as&nbsp;a victory for Prabowo, considering Japan's position as the fourth-largest economy and as a country that has invested in Indonesia for decades.&nbsp;\nThe feeling was mutual. Xi is certainly enthusiastic about Prabowo because he can expect a continuation of President Jokowi's policies.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nOne major subject that came up during the meeting was the Whoosh high-speed railway (HSR) from Jakarta to Bandung which Xi saw as an&nbsp;example&nbsp;of \"high-quality bilateral cooperation\" and that the project marked \"a new stage of building a community with a shared future.\"\nXi also told Prabowo, a former military general who was once considered a Washington protege,&nbsp;that \"the key to successful China-Indonesia relations is to adhere to strategic independence, mutual trust and mutual assistance, win-win cooperation and fairness and justice.\"\nAfter meeting Xi on Monday, in his capacity as defense minister, Prabowo held talks with several Chinese senior officials including his Chinese counterpart Dong Jun and&nbsp;Prime Minister Li Qiang.\nIn these meetings, Prabowo again reiterated his&nbsp;support for&nbsp;a closer relationship with China and pledged to continue Indonesia's friendly policies toward China\n.\nThe ties between Indonesia and China are not without problems.\nThere is a growing concern over the imbalanced economic ties between the two countries. But before blaming Beijing, the Indonesian government should make an honest assessment of its shortcomings on closing the gap. Too often we complain about unfair treatment from other countries without trying to fix our internal problems.\nAnd then, of course the issue of the&nbsp;Natuna islands, where China claims its fishermen have navigated for centuries. The United Nations has recognized Indonesia's exclusive economic zone (EEZ) rights on the resources-rich body of water, but&nbsp;the two countries must ensure the difference will not&nbsp;adversely impact their bilateral relationship.\nFrom the Beijing visit, we can also see that as the de-facto leader of ASEAN, Prabowo wants to maintain Indonesia's regional leadership while maximizing its position as a middle power in the Indo-Pacific. Indonesia is too important on the world stage to simply stick to one regional bloc.\nPrabowo is cognizant that US President Joe Biden has paid a special attention to him. We can see this from how he congratulated Prabowo soon after&nbsp;the General Elections Commission (KPU) announced the final tally last month.\nWe can also expect that Prabowo will go to Washington, DC before October to reaffirm Indonesia's free and active foreign policy and send a clear message that Indonesia and the region still needs a US presence.\nHis meeting with Kishida, a staunch ally of Biden in the region,&nbsp;and his Japanese counterpart Minoru Kihara should be seen as a precursor to that balancing act.\nThis is also a diplomatic coup for Prabowo, simply because of&nbsp;Japan's position as the world's fourth largest economy and one of Indonesia's most important trade and investment&nbsp;partners.&nbsp;\nThe Japanese government has welcomed Prabowo warmly. \"Indonesia is a comprehensive strategic partner [of Japan] that shares fundamental principles and values, \u201cchief cabinet secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi said on Monday.\nPrabowo's two-country trip this week is a very positive step in laying the groundwork for the larger diplomatic arena that he will navigate once he takes office in October.\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nRelated Articles\nPrabowo calls for more prudent government spending amid global tensions\nReengineering culture to sustain Prabowo\u2019s leadership\nGovt\u2019s pitch to foreign housing developers no easy sell\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nPLN Nusantara Power Showcases Solar PV projects at Japan RE Invest 2024\nRelated Article\nPrabowo calls for more prudent government spending amid global tensions\nReengineering culture to sustain Prabowo\u2019s leadership\nGovt\u2019s pitch to foreign housing developers no easy sell\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nPLN Nusantara Power Showcases Solar PV projects at Japan RE Invest 2024\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nMore in Opinion\nView more\nAcademia\nThe bottom-up wave of democratic rejuvenation\nAcademia\nPolice brutality: Fundamental problems in the institution\nAcademia\nFree trade deals increase Indonesian imports more than exports\nHighlight\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEditorial\nNarrow margin\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nThe Latest\nView more\nEconomy\nRI identifies 29 potential nuclear power plant sites\nEconomy\nChinese authorities are considering a weaker yuan as Trump trade risks loom, sources say\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia commences evacuation of 37 citizens in Damascus\nTech\nUS finalizes $6.1 billion Micron chip-making subsidy\nArchipelago\nTwo foreign visitors killed in tree collapse in Monkey Forest\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEconomy\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources\nRegulations\nBullion bank to launch in first half of next year, Airlangga says",

(AFP/Nhac Nguyen)\nT\nhe period from August to September marks a significant period for both Indonesia and Vietnam historically. After Sukarno proclaimed Indonesian independence on Aug. 17, 1945, Ho Chi Minh declared the independence of Vietnam on Sept. 2 of the same year.\nLooking back at the past decade, Indonesia and Vietnam have enjoyed strong economic cooperation. Driven by our strong partnership and rapid economic development, bilateral trade and investment have grown exponentially. In 2023, bilateral trade reached US$13.8 billion in 2023, exceeding the target of $10 billion set by the leaders of both countries. Two-way investment between the countries also reached unprecedented figures.\nThis year marks a milestone for Indonesia-Vietnam bilateral relations, with President Joko \u201cJokowi\u201d Widodo making a state visit to Hanoi in January. The key takeaway of the visit was the commitment to promote cooperation and collaboration to achieve the shared vision of becoming high-income countries by 2045.\nAs a follow-up to this visit, ministers of the two ASEAN countries have met to discuss the ways forward. This includes setting a new bilateral trade target of $18 billion by 2028 - reflecting our success in achieving the previous target.\nThe fulfillment of this new target lies in promoting cooperation on five key sectors that we consider the priority of Indonesia-Vietnam economic cooperation, namely agriculture, fisheries, renewable energy, the digital economy and high-tech industries.\nWith a combined population of more than 380 million, food security serves as a key foundation of economic development for both Indonesia and Vietnam.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nAs developing countries, agriculture and fisheries play important roles in ensuring national food security. In this sense, cooperation between the two countries should be focused on supporting each other and exploring ways to increase productivity. Moreover, being among the largest rice and fish producers in the world, cooperation between Indonesia and Vietnam is essential to not only ensure domestic sufficiency, but also regional food security.\nAmid rapid economic growth, however, Indonesia and Vietnam must be able to address the issues of sustainability.\nAs industrialization tends to jeopardize air quality and environmental sustainability, Indonesia has set a net-zero emissions target by 2060 and Vietnam by 2050. Both countries are currently exploring ways to reach this target, to accelerate the transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy.\nWhile commitments to reach these targets exist, their implementation remains a challenge. To this end, both countries need to double down on efforts in the energy transition, including exchanging best practices and sharing experiences, particularly on the implementation of the Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP) framework, in which Indonesia and Vietnam are partners.\nFurthermore, today the availability of renewable energy and efforts toward energy transition also become key elements in attracting quality investment, as investors now consider environmental, social, governance (ESG) issues a deciding factor for investment.\nGiven the strong demography of the working age population, cooperation in the digital economy is also a huge potential for both countries. Start-ups in both countries are rising at a rapid pace, and this positive momentum should be harnessed effectively.\nWith a more integrated digital economy, Indonesia and Vietnam can promote cross-border payments and transactions, which will speed up economic activities between both countries.\nTo fulfill the aspirations to become developed economies, it is important for both countries to focus on producing high value-added products, based on technology. Both Indonesia and Vietnam are developing their own expertise.\nFor instance, Vietnam\u2019s electric vehicles, which are already entering Indonesia\u2019s market, or Indonesia\u2019s animal pharmaceutical businesses, one of which has just completed building the largest animal vaccine factory in Vietnam this year. The two countries should complement each other and together contribute to building a regional single production base in Southeast Asia.\nBeyond 2024, amid the challenges, the prospect for Indonesia-Vietnam economic relations will continue to shine bright. New leaderships following the inauguration of Vietnam\u2019s President To Lam in May 2024, followed by the inauguration of Indonesia\u2019s new president in October 2024, are expected to invigorate cooperation between both countries.\nIndonesia\u2019s president-elect\nPrabowo Subianto\nis expected to continue the success of existing programs while adding extra focus on other sectors, such as promoting the development of human resources from early years. These extra sectors will create new avenues for Indonesia and Vietnam cooperation.\nBy riding the positive wave of the demographic bonus, the shared vision to become high-income countries, and the passion of the people, I am positive of the future of Indonesia and Vietnam.\nNext year, Indonesia and Vietnam will celebrate an important milestone in our long-forged relationship, 70 years of diplomatic relations. This is a great opportunity for both countries to strengthen the partnership into higher levels.\nWhile in the region, the increasing influence of Indonesia and Vietnam will be one of the key foundations for ASEAN to maintain its stability, centrality and unity. Hence promoting stability and security must continue to be at the top of the list for both countries, both in the bilateral context and in the context of ASEAN.\nIn this sense I am confident that both Indonesia and Vietnam will continue to be fully committed to contributing to peace, stability and prosperity in the ASEAN region and beyond.\n***\nThe writer is Indonesian ambassador to Vietnam\n.\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nRelated Articles\nMake farming profitable again\nActivists protest rejection of dog and cat meat trade ban\nMeaningful digital transformation for the Asia-Pacific region\nState budget financing remains on track to protect welfare, maintain stability\nA Trump return would threaten global fight against climate change\nRelated Article\nMake farming profitable again\nActivists protest rejection of dog and cat meat trade ban\nMeaningful digital transformation for the Asia-Pacific region\nState budget financing remains on track to protect welfare, maintain stability\nA Trump return would threaten global fight against climate change\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nMore in Opinion\nView more\nAcademia\nThe bottom-up wave of democratic rejuvenation\nAcademia\nPolice brutality: Fundamental problems in the institution\nAcademia\nFree trade deals increase Indonesian imports more than exports\nHighlight\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEditorial\nNarrow margin\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nThe Latest\nView more\nEconomy\nRI identifies 29 potential nuclear power plant sites\nEconomy\nChinese authorities are considering a weaker yuan as Trump trade risks loom, sources say\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia commences evacuation of 37 citizens in Damascus\nTech\nUS finalizes $6.1 billion Micron chip-making subsidy\nArchipelago\nTwo foreign visitors killed in tree collapse in Monkey Forest\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEconomy\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources\nRegulations\nBullion bank to launch in first half of next year, Airlangga says",

(Reuters/China Daily)\nVersi Bahasa Indonesia\nP\nresident-elect\nPrabowo Subianto\nvisited Beijing on Monday on his first foreign trip since his election, and was quoted by Chinese state media as telling President Xi Jinping he aimed to continue the close ties under predecessor Joko \"Jokowi\" Widodo.\nPrabowo \"fully supports the development of closer&nbsp;Indonesia-China relations and wishes to continue President Joko's policy of friendship with China,\" China's CCTV quoted Prabowo as saying.\nThe new&nbsp;Indonesian government will promote the alignment of development strategies between the two countries and push for more results in cooperation in fields such as the economy, trade and poverty alleviation, he said.\nPrabowo, now a defence minister, also said that he viewed China as a key partner.\n\"Regarding defence cooperation, I view China as one of the key partners in ensuring regional peace and stability,\" he said in a statement, adding that he sought to boost defence cooperations with China.\n\"I also commit to fulfil the needs of&nbsp;Indonesia's military hardware, boost cooperation in the defence industry and establish productive dialogues,\" he added.&nbsp;\nXi described Prabowo as an \"old friend of the Chinese people\" and said China views its relations with&nbsp;Indonesia&nbsp;from a strategic and long-term perspective, standing ready to deepen all-round strategic cooperation.\nXi also told Prabowo that bilateral ties \"have entered a new stage of jointly building a community with a shared future\", state broadcaster CCTV reported.\nChina \"is willing to deepen all-round strategic cooperation with Indonesia and build a China-Indonesia community with... regional and global influence, so as to bring more benefits to the two peoples and make positive contributions to regional and world peace and development,\" Xi said.\nPrabowo, 72, was elected in February but will not be sworn in until October. A long-time rival of the outgoing leader Jokowi, he is now widely seen as enjoying his predecessor's strong support, winning his decisive victory with Jokowi's son as his vice presidential running-mate.\n\"The key to the valuable achievements of China-Indonesia&nbsp;relations lies in adherence to strategic autonomy, mutual trust and mutual assistance,\" CCTV quoted Xi as saying in the meeting.\nPrabowo's decision to visit China ahead of&nbsp;Indonesia's neighbours in the region underlines the close partnership built up in the past decade under Jokowi, when China became&nbsp;Indonesia's top trading partner, supplying natural resources including nickel and coal.&nbsp;\nJokowi's first visit after his inauguration was to China, for an annual summit of Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) leaders in 2014. That was followed by six more visits.\nChina has also ploughed billions into&nbsp;Indonesian infrastructure and industrial projects, including the Jakarta-Bandung high-speed railway.&nbsp;\nXi hailed the rail initiative as \"a golden sign of high-quality cooperation between the two countries\", according to CCTV.\nIt remains to be seen how Prabowo, now&nbsp;Indonesia's defence minister, will navigate issues including the jostling for influence between China and the United States in Southeast Asia.&nbsp;\nPrabowo has previously said&nbsp;Indonesia&nbsp;was committed to its policy of non-alignment and would keep good ties with both China and the United States.&nbsp;\nChina's expansive claims in the South China Sea may present a test for his leadership, although the two countries' overlapping claims there have not become a vociferous dispute as has unfolded in recent months between China and the Philippines.&nbsp;\nIndonesia&nbsp;says the southern end of the South China Sea is part of its exclusive economic zone. China says the area is within its own territorial claim, marked by a U-shaped \"nine-dash line\" rejected by other regional states.\nChina is willing to continue to deepen maritime cooperation with&nbsp;Indonesia, Xi told Prabowo on Monday.\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nRelated Articles\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nReengineering culture to sustain Prabowo\u2019s leadership\nFocus on revenue reform\nPutin\u2019s India visit aims to shape global multipolarity\nVietnam to build $67 billion high-speed railway\nRelated Article\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nReengineering culture to sustain Prabowo\u2019s leadership\nFocus on revenue reform\nPutin\u2019s India visit aims to shape global multipolarity\nVietnam to build $67 billion high-speed railway\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nMore in World\nView more\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia commences evacuation of 37 citizens in Damascus\nMiddle East and Africa\nAirline pilots, crews voice concerns about Middle East routes\nAmericas\nLula 'stable' after emergency surgery\nHighlight\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEditorial\nNarrow margin\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nThe Latest\nView more\nEconomy\nRI identifies 29 potential nuclear power plant sites\nEconomy\nChinese authorities are considering a weaker yuan as Trump trade risks loom, sources say\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia commences evacuation of 37 citizens in Damascus\nTech\nUS finalizes $6.1 billion Micron chip-making subsidy\nArchipelago\nTwo foreign visitors killed in tree collapse in Monkey Forest\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEconomy\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources\nRegulations\nBullion bank to launch in first half of next year, Airlangga says",

(Antara/Jessica Wuysang)\nW\norld Social Work Day (WSWD) is celebrated every year on the third Tuesday of March. It has become a high point in the social work calendar, with social workers worldwide, including in Indonesia, celebrating and promoting the profession's contributions to individuals, families, communities, and wider society.\nThis year\u2019s theme, \"\nBuen Vivir\n: Shared Future for Transformative Change\", highlights the importance of social workers embracing community-led approaches grounded in indigenous wisdom and harmonious coexistence with nature for social transformation.\nThe concept of\nBuen Vivir\n, a Spanish word for \u201cgood living\u201d or \u201cliving well,\u201d originated from South American philosophy and has even been inscribed in the constitutions of Ecuador and Bolivia.&nbsp;It incorporates ideas of de-growth, austerity, and a stern critique of extractivism, which invokes limits in development. The idea emphasizes that humans are never owners of the earth and its resources, only stewards. Within the framework, those other futures we want must be well kept in check.\nSocial workers are important human resources in development. The distinguishing characteristic of social workers from other professions is their emphasis on the person-in-environment model and social justice.\nSocial justice is an integral part of social work and is strongly embedded in its value of equality. Including struggles for environmental justice within an environmental framework is a critical and significant part of social workers\u2019 activities. It surfaces when redressing complex environmental degradation issues, vulnerability among marginalized populations, and disaster responses.\nThe Golden Indonesia 2045 Vision envisions Indonesia becoming a high-income country, the world's fourth or fifth largest economy by 2045, with near-zero poverty. The goal is set for 2045 since the republic will commemorate 100 years of its independence by then. Meanwhile, inequality is and will likely remain a key challenge threatening Indonesia\u2019s future growth and prosperity.&nbsp;\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nInequality threatens long-term social and economic development, harms poverty reduction, and destroys people\u2019s fulfillment and self-worth. Sustainable development cannot be achieved if individuals and communities are excluded from better access and contribution to social, economic, and political life. Therefore, reducing inequalities and ensuring no one is left behind are key to achieving all 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nRelated Articles\nThe rise of Islamic environmentalism and neoliberalism\nMoving up social workers with the \u2018Buen Vivir\u2019 wisdom&nbsp;\nHappy birthday, Pancasila; from Germany\nPreventing stadium tragedy through policy improvement\nOutlook darkens for Wall Street as Biden's regulators take shape\nRelated Article\nThe rise of Islamic environmentalism and neoliberalism\nMoving up social workers with the \u2018Buen Vivir\u2019 wisdom&nbsp;\nHappy birthday, Pancasila; from Germany\nPreventing stadium tragedy through policy improvement\nOutlook darkens for Wall Street as Biden's regulators take shape\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nMore in Opinion\nView more\nAcademia\nThe bottom-up wave of democratic rejuvenation\nAcademia\nPolice brutality: Fundamental problems in the institution\nAcademia\nFree trade deals increase Indonesian imports more than exports\nHighlight\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEditorial\nNarrow margin\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nThe Latest\nView more\nEconomy\nRI identifies 29 potential nuclear power plant sites\nEconomy\nChinese authorities are considering a weaker yuan as Trump trade risks loom, sources say\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia commences evacuation of 37 citizens in Damascus\nTech\nUS finalizes $6.1 billion Micron chip-making subsidy\nArchipelago\nTwo foreign visitors killed in tree collapse in Monkey Forest\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEconomy\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources\nRegulations\nBullion bank to launch in first half of next year, Airlangga says",

Yudo Margono (front left), former commander of Joint Defense Regional Command I, inspects Indonesian troops on Jan. 3, 2020, at a military base in Natuna Islands regency, the Riau Islands, in this handout photo provided by the Indonesian Military (TNI). (AFP/Handout)\nO\nn Sunday, several Indonesian and foreign diplomats texted me to express their shock over the 14-point joint statement, especially point 9, issued after the summit between Chinese President Xi Jinping and visiting President\nPrabowo Subianto\nin Beijing on Saturday. They were curious if Prabowo would reverse Indonesia\u2019s long-standing position on China\u2019s nine-dash line in the South China Sea, or if it was simply a show of negligence from our side.\nA veteran Indonesian diplomat asked, \u201cCould this be interpreted as Indonesia recognizing China's nine-dash line and undermining its own sovereignty, or just going it alone?\u201d He continued, \u201cJoint development cooperation in the overlapping waters claimed by the two countries [makes it] seem like we are giving legitimacy to PRC maritime claims.\u201d\nA senior journalist deems that the Foreign Ministry\u2019s long-standing position on the South China Sea and Natuna waters must change in line with the vision of Prabowo, a former Army general.\n\u201cWatch out for more changes in long time foreign policy positions under Prabowo. Diplomats and military see things differently,\u201d he said in a WhatsApp group conversation.\nThe joint statement is called the \u201cJoint Statement Between the People's Republic of China and the Republic of Indonesia on Advancing the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership and the China-Indonesia Community with a Shared Future\u201d.\nOn point 9, the two leaders do not explicitly refer to the tensions between the two countries in the North Natuna waters. The 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) grants Indonesia the sovereign right to exploit resources in the waters as its exclusive economic zone (EEZ), but China claims that the area has been the fishing ground of its seafarers for thousands of years.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nAccording to the joint statement: \u201cBoth sides emphasized maritime cooperation as an important component of the comprehensive strategic cooperation between China and Indonesia.

(AFP/Luis Tata)\nI\nn today\u2019s shifting geopolitical landscape, few multilateral alliances are as steadfast, or as essential, as the Group of 77 (G77). Since its founding in 1964, the bloc has expanded to include 134 countries from Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean, collectively representing 80 percent of the world\u2019s population and two-thirds of the United Nations\u2019 member states.\nBut the G77 has struggled to define its role in a rapidly changing world. This was evident at the group\u2019s recent policy forum in New York, the United States, commemorating its 60th anniversary. I had the privilege of speaking at this event, hosted by its Ugandan chair, which highlighted the G77\u2019s long-term challenges while showcasing its immense potential and growing global influence.\nFormed as a coalition of the world\u2019s poorest countries, the G77 was conceived as a \u201cweapon of the weak,\u201d initially seeking to leverage its large membership to amplify the Global South\u2019s voice in multilateral institutions. Yet, despite its size, the group has been unable to reshape the Westphalian state system and US-dominated postwar economic order, structures established long before many developing countries gained their independence.\nThe G77\u2019s origins can be traced to the inaugural session of the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) in 1964. From the outset, the bloc has sought to challenge US-designed institutions like the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and its successor, the World Trade Organization, and promote a more equitable international order. At its first ministerial summit in October 1967, the group adopted the Algiers Charter, which called for sweeping reforms to address the hardships faced by developing countries in a global economic system heavily skewed in favor of the West.\nThe Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), established in 1961, emerged as a natural ally to the G77, with many overlapping members and shared objectives. Both groups drove transformative advances in international law, championing the principle of self-determination, especially in Palestine and Western Sahara, while affirming the legitimacy of decolonization and armed resistance in Algeria, Mozambique, South Africa and Vietnam. They denounced South Africa\u2019s apartheid system as a \u201ccrime against humanity\u201d.\nThese efforts were inspired by the 1960 Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, a landmark UN resolution that became a cornerstone of the decolonization movement. During this period, an unspoken Afro-Arab alliance emerged, as African countries supported the Palestinian struggle for statehood and Arab governments backed black South Africans in their fight against white settler rule.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nIn its quest to challenge Western-dominated systems, the G77 has also cultivated a unique and enduring alliance with China. This relationship, shaped by heated North-South debates in the UN General Assembly, deepened after the G77 played a pivotal role in Taiwan\u2019s 1971 expulsion from the UN, clearing the way for the People\u2019s Republic to take its seat. Although not formally part of the G77, China remains the only permanent member of the Security Council to be regularly invited to its meetings.\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nActivists call for accountability in a year filled with police brutality\nRelated Article\nStop with the LGBTQ scapegoating\nAgainst the tide: Defending human rights and civic freedoms in Southeast Asia\nAssad's fall in Syria exposes limits of China's Middle East diplomacy\nWith Assad gone, Middle East battle lines are redrawn\nPrabowo's maiden overseas trip indicative of RI's active global role\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nActivists call for accountability in a year filled with police brutality\nMore in Opinion\nView more\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo\u2019s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?\nAcademia\nStop with the LGBTQ scapegoating\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nAcademia\nNavigating Indonesia-US relations amid global and domestic changes",

They were curious if Prabowo would reverse Indonesia\u2019s long-standing position on China\u2019s nine-dash line in the South China Sea, or if it was simply a show of negligence from our side.\nA veteran Indonesian diplomat asked, \u201cCould this be interpreted as Indonesia recognizing China's nine-dash line and undermining its own sovereignty, or just going it alone?\u201d He continued, \u201cJoint development cooperation in the overlapping waters claimed by the two countries [makes it] seem like we are giving legitimacy to PRC maritime claims.\u201d\nA senior journalist deems that the Foreign Ministry\u2019s long-standing position on the South China Sea and Natuna waters must change in line with the vision of Prabowo, a former Army general.\n\u201cWatch out for more changes in long time foreign policy positions under Prabowo.

The 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) grants Indonesia the sovereign right to exploit resources in the waters as its exclusive economic zone (EEZ), but China claims that the area has been the fishing ground of its seafarers for thousands of years.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nAccording to the joint statement: \u201cBoth sides emphasized maritime cooperation as an important component of the comprehensive strategic cooperation between China and Indonesia.

(Reuters/Florence Lo)\nP\nresident\nPrabowo Subianto\n\u2019s inaugural visit to China underscores a pivot toward great power diplomacy, a strategic approach that may mark a significant departure from Indonesia\u2019s traditional stance more closely resembling what is now referred to and discussed as \u201cmiddle power diplomacy.\u201d\nOver the weekend, Prabowo met with key Chinese leaders, including Zhao Leji, chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Premier Li Qiang, and finally, President Xi Jinping. The visit yielded several notable agreements, such as a US$10 billion investment pledge between the countries and several memorandums of understanding related to water conservation, the blue economy and maritime resources, and mining.\nThe joint statement issued by the leaders, titled \u201cPromoting Comprehensive Strategic Partnership and Building a China-Indonesia Community with a Shared Future\u201d, reflects Prabowo\u2019s strategic framing of China as an essential partner.\nFrom the various statements expressed by Prabowo, we can take a glimpse of how he stressed a multipolar world order, guided by principles like strategic autonomy, mutual trust, fairness and win-win cooperation.\nSuch a worldview indeed reflects the argument of the erosion of moral leadership by the very pole that has led the current global order, the United States, from unilateral protectionist policies, lack of appetite for all things multilateral, all the way to the moral quandary in the conflict in the Middle East.\nYet one aspect of this trip has raised concerns both domestically and internationally.

(Antara/Vice Presidential Secretariat )\nA\nt the time of writing, the Middle East is ablaze with conflict, threatening to spiral into a full-scale regional war. This crisis, compounded by the ongoing devastation of the Russia-Ukraine war and the escalating strategic competition between the United States and China, is sending shockwaves through global supply chains, destabilizing energy markets and intensifying protectionist tendencies.\nIn this fraught landscape, the world also faces the combined challenges of slowing economic growth, financial turbulence, as well as climate disasters and health crises. These converging forces have raised urgent concerns about long-term economic resilience for the global economy. In such precarious times, the need for collaborative action to safeguard stability and strengthen the ability to withstand and rebound from economic disruptions has never been more critical.\nWith its strategic location, abundant natural resources, and a dynamic, youthful workforce, Indonesia is uniquely poised to drive ASEAN\u2019s future growth and enhance the region\u2019s economic resilience.\nAs the largest economy in the region, Indonesia has been playing a pivotal role in shaping ASEAN\u2019s economic agenda with a consistent track record. It has led major regional initiatives that have shaped the trajectory of economic cooperation in Southeast Asia. For example, Indonesia was instrumental in developing the 2003 Bali Concord II, which laid the groundwork for the eventual establishment of the ASEAN Economic Community.\nThroughout its chairmanship last year, Indonesia championed priorities that echoed its own national agenda, spearheading post-pandemic recovery through digital transformation and sustainable development. These efforts, including a strong focus on digitization and emerging industries like electric vehicles, reflect Indonesia's commitment to forging a resilient, future-ready economy for the country and the broader ASEAN Community.\nImportant milestones during Indonesia\u2019s 2023 chairmanship include, among others, the convening of the ASEAN Indo-Pacific Forum and the launch of negotiations on the Digital Economy Framework Agreement (DEFA). Once finalized, DEFA will become the world\u2019s first regional digital economy agreement.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nIndonesia is also actively seeking to reduce barriers to prosperity within its society, understanding that resilience must be cultivated from the ground up. Through targeted social programs, support for micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs), digital inclusion, and infrastructure development that connects remote areas to economic hubs, Indonesia is strengthening local economies and addressing internal disparities.\nThis focus on inclusive growth has also shaped Indonesia\u2019s economic leadership within ASEAN. Through the ASEAN Comprehensive Recovery Framework, Indonesia emphasized the critical role of supporting MSMEs to drive economic vitality and reduce inequalities, creating a foundation for equitable growth and shared prosperity, which is the prerequisite for long-term resilience.\nGiven the profound integration of our economies within global supply chains and the critical role of international trade in driving our economic growth, advancing an open trade agenda through a robust network of ASEAN free trade agreements with key partners is essential. Indonesia has played a pivotal role in these initiatives, notably the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), the world\u2019s largest free trade agreement, which came into effect in 2022.\nIndonesia\u2019s active role will continue to be crucial in ensuring that ASEAN remains a key player in the global supply chains.\nThis proactive approach aligns seamlessly with Lao PDR\u2019s ASEAN chairmanship this year, which features the theme \u201cEnhancing Connectivity and Resilience\u201d. The recent ASEAN Summit in Vientiane reaffirmed ASEAN\u2019s resolve to strengthen its collective resilience and regional integration to withstand and address emerging global challenges, from geoeconomic geopolitical tensions to the increasing fragmentation of the global economy.\nAs the world\u2019s fifth-largest economy and third-largest global trading power, ASEAN must enhance its ability to navigate an increasingly fragmented global order, especially given its reliance on open economic regionalism. Deepening intra-ASEAN economic integration while strengthening external economic relations will be essential for ensuring resilience in the face of global challenges. Furthermore, ASEAN must prioritize several strategic initiatives and priorities that reinforce resilience while promoting sustainable and inclusive growth throughout the region.\nFirst, strengthening intra-ASEAN trade and investment is essential. While trade with major economies like the US, China and the European Union remains vital, ASEAN's resilience hinges on boosting intra-regional trade, capitalizing on the region's promising growth prospects.\nIn 2023, intra-ASEAN trade reached US$758.9 billion, accounting for 21 percent of total trade, a significant contribution given that ASEAN's total trade of $3.5 trillion is nearly on par with its GDP of $3.8 trillion.\nTo accelerate growth, ASEAN must focus on reducing non-tariff barriers, harmonizing standards and enhancing digital trade and customs processes. The ongoing upgrade of the ASEAN Trade in Goods Agreement (ATIGA) addresses both traditional trade issues and emerging challenges such as supply chain connectivity and food security. This initiative also explores innovative dispute resolution mechanisms and integrates circular economy principles, reinforcing ASEAN\u2019s role in sustainable global supply chains.\nIntra-ASEAN investment, valued at $21.8 billion (9.5 percent of ASEAN\u2019s total in 2023), also presents significant growth potential. The signing of the Fifth Protocol of the ASEAN Comprehensive Investment Agreement (ACIA) this year marks a critical step in modernizing ASEAN\u2019s investment framework.\nIt is essential to enhance the business environment by promoting regulatory transparency, advancing infrastructure development and ensuring seamless mobility of goods, services and people across the region. These initiatives will not only foster a more attractive investment climate but also strengthen the overall economic integration within ASEAN, paving the way for sustainable growth and resilience.\nSecond, ASEAN must maintain open regionalism and diversify its supply chains. As multinational corporations increasingly seek to reduce dependency on single countries or regions, ASEAN is strategically positioned to seize this opportunity, thanks to its extensive network of free trade agreements with major global economies.\nWith Indonesia\u2019s leadership, ASEAN is implementing the RCEP, upgrading free trade agreements with major economies like China and India, and negotiating a new agreement with Canada, while continuously exploring new markets with vast growth potential.\nThird, embracing the digital and sustainable economy is crucial. Driven by rapid technological adoption, e-commerce and digital finance, ASEAN\u2019s digital economy is projected to be worth $1 trillion by 2030, with the potential to double through ambitious negotiations on the DEFA.\nBeyond digitalization, sustainability and environmental resilience have become central to global economic discussions, especially in the face of climate change. Under Indonesia\u2019s chairmanship last year, ASEAN adopted the ASEAN Strategy for Carbon Neutrality and the ASEAN Blue Economy Framework, reinforcing commitments to decarbonization and sustainable growth at both the regional and national levels.\nLastly, ASEAN must preserve its centrality and engage constructively with all major powers. Amid rising geopolitical tensions, maintaining ASEAN's centrality by strengthening regional institutions and promoting multilateralism is essential. Constructive engagement with major powers, while avoiding entanglement in rivalries, will be crucial for ASEAN\u2019s future.\nLooking ahead, under the leadership of President\nPrabowo Subianto\n, we look forward to Indonesia\u2019s continued proactive role in navigating ASEAN through the complexities of a fragmented global economy.

(Antara/Maria Cicilia)\nR\necent international projections have raised world growth expectations to 2.6 percent, with emerging and developing economies leading the rebound with an average of 4 percent. In contrast, advanced economies are forecast to expand more modestly, at 1.5 percent.\nChile is not separate from this trend. Estimations from the country\u2019s Finance Ministry and central bank point to 2-3 percent economic growth in 2024, a figure backed by similar projections from international organizations such as the World Bank, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the International Monetary Fund.\nThe projections for international trade are equally optimistic. The IMF, the OECD and World Trade Organization (WTO) project an increase in trade flows of between 2.3 and 3 percent by 2024 and 3.3 percent by 2025. These numbers reflect a recovery in world trade driven by robust global economic growth.\nChile, recognized worldwide as a reliable and safe destination for investment, faces the crucial task of diversifying its trade partners and attracting more foreign direct investment (FDI).\nChile\u2019s President Gabriel Boric announced that in 2023, we had achieved the highest FDI figure since 2015 with more than US$21.7 billion invested, which analysts have recognized. Promoting and strengthening our international ties to diversify our destination markets and investment sources is therefore vital to boost growth and productivity in Chile.\nFDI could support trade and integration into global value chains, encourage innovation and promote better-paid jobs and sustainable development.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nThrough President Boric's mandate, we will continue our firm commitment to opening new markets for our exporters and attracting diverse capital that promotes sustainable economies and improves the well-being of our societies.\nNonetheless, we cannot ignore the global geopolitical context in which we find ourselves, characterized by armed conflicts, a scarcity of natural resources, the climate crisis and the contentious trade relationship between great powers.\nThis situation poses a significant challenge to generating greater resilience in supply chains, fostering regional integration and strengthening ties with trading partners to mitigate risks.\nChile and Indonesia emerge as complementary partners in this complex panorama of international trade. Both countries are rich in natural resources (key to the global energy transition) and are actively seeking to expand their commercial horizons.\nIndonesia, one of the economies with higher growth in Southeast Asia, and Chile, a solid economy in Latin America, strengthened their complementarities by implementing the Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) in August 2019, initially focused on the exchange of goods.\nIn the almost five years since, the agreement has increased bilateral trade, with average annual growth of 11.2 percent. It is worth highlighting that Chilean exports to Indonesia include copper, wood and salmon, and imports from Indonesia include passenger cars, footwear and chemical products. This firm growth reflects the synergy between both nations and underlines the potential for further mutual economic development.\nTo continue strengthening our economic relationship with Indonesia, we have incorporated trade in services into our bilateral economic comprehensive agreement, allowing us to boost commercial exchange in this sector.\nAccording to data from the WTO, trade in services registered 9 percent growth globally in 2023. This advance, already approved by the National Congress of Chile, could increase access to professional services of various types (legal, architecture, engineering, medical and dental, informatics, research and development, cultural and transportation, among other areas), providing certainty and predictability in the exports of both countries.\nI recently visited Indonesia to advance the deepening of the CEPA, incorporating an investment chapter that will provide legal certainty and improve the regulatory capacity of our states. This visit reaffirms our commitment to diversifying and strengthening our commercial ties, thus promoting a future of growth and shared prosperity.\nWith the deepening of economic-trade relations, we hope that Indonesia can see our country as a platform for integration and rapprochement with Latin America, especially South America.\nFor Chile, Indonesia can be projected as a key market in its diversification strategy, both in its export basket and destinations, opening new opportunities to improve the quality of life in both countries.\n***\nThe writer is undersecretary of international economic relations of Chile.\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nActivists call for accountability in a year filled with police brutality\nRelated Article\nJapan seeks Indonesia\u2019s help to solve labor crisis\nMission to Syria\nIndonesia\u2019s drive for AI leadership in Southeast Asia\nGovt eyes $6 billion in forex revenue from solar power exports\nASEAN in the global economy: A half-century journey\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nActivists call for accountability in a year filled with police brutality\nMore in Opinion\nView more\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo\u2019s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?\nAcademia\nStop with the LGBTQ scapegoating\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nAcademia\nNavigating Indonesia-US relations amid global and domestic changes",

From talking about land to talking about water, the two fundamental elements that are inseparable in our life.\nAs the global population continues to grow rapidly and reach approximately 10 billion by 2050, we will have to deal with land and water scarcity, sooner rather than later. It is indeed one of the most pressing issues facing humanity this century. By 2030, it is estimated that fresh water supplies will fall by 40 percent, but at the same time the world will need up to 60 percent more food than today.\nWithout land and water, there will be no agriculture; there will be no food. So basically, without sufficient land and water, we are all doomed. These facts alone should be more than enough for us to unite, collaborate and take action.\nNow, add global warming and climate crisis to the equation. We cannot afford the price of ignorance and inaction.\nPrior to the local and regional authorities\u2019 declaration, I was asked to deliver a speech to the WWF, which was themed \u201cWater for Shared Prosperity\u201d. The theme is relevant and significant, because it embodies at least three inter-related principles, which are meaningful for strengthening our global commitment to establish more effective water governance.\nFirst, water management must always be oriented toward \u201cprosperity\", which has a much broader meaning than material wealth. The scope of genuine prosperity also includes the state of success, happiness and health.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nThis is why for the past 10 years the government has built various water infrastructure facilities all over the country. Most notably, the building of 42 dams, which are aimed at enhancing water supply and irrigation for agriculture, industry and domestic use. They are also utilized for hydro-power generation, flood control and disaster management, as well as for recreation, sport and tourism. All of them generate significant economic value added and growth, which in the end contribute to the prosperity of the people.\nSecond, \u201cfair accessibility\u201d, which is a manifestation of inter-spatial sharing. Water management must be implemented fairly to provide all citizens with equal access to drinking water and sanitation.\nOne common issue faced by many countries is regional disparity in access to water resources. Some regions naturally have sufficient, or even abundant water resources. While other regions either lack natural water resources, or lack infrastructure that makes water accessible for their people.\nGiven this situation, both central and local governments must ensure all individuals and communities have equitable access to safe, affordable and sufficient water resources for their basic needs and livelihoods.\nAnd the third principle is \u201csustainability\u201d. It is a manifestation of inter-generational sharing. What we do, and what we do not do today, will shape our future. We want our children, and our children\u2019s children to live in a sustainable and livable planet.\nTherefore, fresh water must be utilized and preserved properly. It should not be overexploited, even for the sake of economic development and growth.\nMahatma Gandhi reminded us: \u201cthe earth, the air, the land and the water are not an inheritance from our forefathers, but on loan from our children. So we have to hand over to them, at least, as they were handed over to us\u201d.\nExcessive exploitation of water resources may improve prosperity and fair accessibility for some people. However, it contradicts with the principle of sustainability. On the other hand, prosperity and sustainability may be attained by certain groups through water monopolies or excessive water restrictions. However, they may hinder fair accessibility of water for the wider community.\nTherefore, those three principles must be upheld by governments, at all levels, simultaneously, and with a good balance. Because that is the best way to realize the true meaning of shared prosperity.\nIn order to implement the three principles of prosperity, fair accessibility and sustainability, governments at national level must establish an institution with the authority and the capacity to integrate and synchronize all policies, strategies and actions related to water management. We can learn some of the best practices from countries that have already established such institutions recently, such as Canada in 2023, as well as Saudi Arabia and South Africa earlier this year.\nThis so-called National Water Agency is aimed at tackling the imminent threats of a water crisis. It should be agile and adaptive, to be able to deal with the extremely broad dimensions of water management, especially in order to prevent and mitigate the crisis. This agency should also be able to resolve the most common bureaucratic problems of ego-sectoral and conflicting interests among stakeholders.\nAt the same time, by providing effective leadership, this agency will be able to strengthen the cross-sectoral coordination and collaboration effort toward the attainment of Water for Shared Prosperity.\nFinally, let us unite, let us collaborate. Through the strong commitment declared by the 10th WWF, global citizens hope that we can come up with an effective solution, and we can take immediate action.\n***\nThe writer is Agrarian Affairs and Spatial Planning Minister and head of National Land Agency.\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Article\nExpensive climate policy is dead, and it could be an immense opportunity\nGlobal warming and the tragedy of the commons\nCOP29 in extra time as poor nations reject $250 bn offer\nA call for a decisive transition to a green economy\nUN warns world's water cycle becoming ever more erratic\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nMore in Opinion\nView more\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo\u2019s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?\nAcademia\nStop with the LGBTQ scapegoating\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nAcademia\nNavigating Indonesia-US relations amid global and domestic changes",

It should be agile and adaptive, to be able to deal with the extremely broad dimensions of water management, especially in order to prevent and mitigate the crisis. This agency should also be able to resolve the most common bureaucratic problems of ego-sectoral and conflicting interests among stakeholders.\nAt the same time, by providing effective leadership, this agency will be able to strengthen the cross-sectoral coordination and collaboration effort toward the attainment of Water for Shared Prosperity.\nFinally, let us unite, let us collaborate. Through the strong commitment declared by the 10th WWF, global citizens hope that we can come up with an effective solution, and we can take immediate action.\n***\nThe writer is Agrarian Affairs and Spatial Planning Minister and head of National Land Agency.\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Article\nExpensive climate policy is dead, and it could be an immense opportunity\nGlobal warming and the tragedy of the commons\nCOP29 in extra time as poor nations reject $250 bn offer\nA call for a decisive transition to a green economy\nUN warns world's water cycle becoming ever more erratic\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nMore in Opinion\nView more\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo\u2019s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?\nAcademia\nStop with the LGBTQ scapegoating\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nAcademia\nNavigating Indonesia-US relations amid global and domestic changes",

(JP/Ni Komang Erviani)\nAs the World Water Forum unfolds in Bali, a critical issue takes center stage: Water scarcity.\nThis global event, convening water experts and decision-makers every three years, provides a unique platform to tackle this pressing challenge. Nowhere is this challenge more evident than on the very island hosting the forum,&nbsp;Bali, the \u201cIsland of the Gods.\u201d\nDecades of tourism and unchecked development have strained Bali\u2019s water resources to a critical point. The Ayung Watershed, a vital source of life for the island, exemplifies this crisis. Over-extraction of groundwater and deforestation have led to increased water runoff, jeopardizing the water security of communities and ecosystems.\nThe consequences are dire. Vulnerable communities, particularly those reliant on agriculture, are the first to suffer.\nWater scarcity can lead to poverty, food insecurity and displacement. The increased water runoff caused by deforestation weakens the soil, making it more susceptible to devastating landslides. Furthermore, saltwater intrusion becomes a growing threat as freshwater reserves dwindle, contaminating coastal aquifers and rendering them unusable for agriculture or drinking.\nHowever, a beacon of hope shines from the Ayung Watershed. A payment for ecosystem services (PES) scheme offers a promising approach to tackle this challenge, and is being presented as a case study at the World Water Forum.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nPES is a market-based solution where water users, such as businesses, provide financial support for sustainable land management practices by local communities. These practices include building infiltration wells to replenish groundwater reserves and implementing regenerative agroforestry techniques that improve water retention in the soil.\nA key aspect of the Ayung Watershed PES scheme is multi-stakeholder collaboration. It brings together government agencies, businesses, NGOs and local communities to achieve a common goal,&nbsp;improving Bali\u2019s water security.\nThis initiative showcases the potential of PES as a tool for financing water resilience and promoting sustainable development, offering valuable insights for the global water community gathered at the World Water Forum.\nThis year's World Water Forum theme, \"Water for Shared Prosperity\", underscores the urgent need for innovative solutions like the Ayung Watershed PES scheme.\nThe global context for water scarcity is stark. Droughts plague many countries year after year. Nearly half of the world's water bodies are compromised by poor water quality.\nThe United Nations has estimated about half of the world's population, 4 billion people, face water shortages at least once a year. By 2025, 1.8 billion people will have to endure severe water shortages.\nClimate change and land-use practices are further degrading water resources, while demand for water is expected to surge by 20-30 percent by 2050, fueled by a growing global population.\nA leading challenge is balancing immediate human needs with the long-term health of freshwater ecosystems. The PES scheme offers a promising contribution to achieving this balance.\nBy financially incentivizing landowners to adopt sustainable land management practices, these programs can achieve a double win. Upstream communities benefit from financial rewards for their conservation efforts, while downstream users enjoy improved water security.\nThis approach, built on multi-stakeholder collaboration, protects vital water resources and reverses the degradation of ecosystems, contributing to a sustainable water future. The Ayung Watershed PES scheme, an example of effective collaboration, has the potential to be a replicable model for water-stressed regions around the world.\nThe World Water Forum presents an important platform to showcase this scheme as a promising model for water management, and stimulate discussions on how PES can contribute to global water security.\nBy working together, we can turn Bali\u2019s experiment into a blueprint for a more sustainable water future, one where shared prosperity is built on a foundation of shared resources.\n***\nThe writer is managing director at Kopernik, an Indonesian-based research and development (R&amp;D) lab for social and environmental challenges.\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nActivists call for accountability in a year filled with police brutality\nRelated Article\nAustralia to charge tech companies for news content if they do not pay\nAn illuminated wonderland awaits at Sofitel Bali Nusa Dua Beach Resort\nAI Day drives Indonesia's AI sovereignty, with Indosat leading solutions and connectivity\nWhy we have to continuously update the poverty line\nMove smarter, breathe easier: Recipe for a global city\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nActivists call for accountability in a year filled with police brutality\nMore in Opinion\nView more\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo\u2019s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?\nAcademia\nStop with the LGBTQ scapegoating\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nAcademia\nNavigating Indonesia-US relations amid global and domestic changes",

(Unsplash/Geri Mis) (Unsplash/Geri Mis)\nIn today\u2019s interconnected world, empathy seems to be increasingly scarce. Statistics paint a concerning picture.\nIn Indonesia, a 2023 study by Yogyakarta-based Gadjah Mada University revealed a growing intergroup prejudice, particularly among the youth. Similarly, a 2022 report from the United Kingdom's Runnymede Trust highlighted enduring ethnic inequalities stemming from a deficit of understanding and empathy.\nThe challenge is evident: Bridging the gap with those who appear different.\nThese consequences extend widely, fueling societal polarization, stifling meaningful dialogue, and obstructing our capacity to address complex global challenges that require collaborative solutions. Whether addressing climate change or economic disparity, a dearth of empathy can exacerbate existing problems and prevent us from working together for a better future.\nSo, where lies the solution? While technology offers connectivity, genuine empathy requires more than a digital connection. It demands active participation, open hearts, and a willingness to step outside our comfort zones. This is where the transformative power of cross-cultural collaboration comes in.\nEngaging in collaborative artistic endeavors that transcend cultural and geographical barriers enables individuals to cultivate profound empathy, dismantle stereotypes, and build bridges of understanding, paving the way for a more compassionate, connected, peaceful, and prosperous world.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nThroughout history, art has catalyzed empathy, fostering understanding across cultures and generations. Artists have utilized art as a platform to advocate for peace, resonating across geographical and temporal divides.\nSimilarly, Beethoven's symphonies craft a universal language of joy and sorrow, uniting hearts despite linguistic differences. These are just a couple of examples to underscore art's enduring capacity to forge visceral connections.\nToday, the enduring legacy of fostering empathy thrives in collaborative art projects, where diverse voices and perspectives can intertwine. Take \"The School of Hope\" in Indonesia, which provides a platform for young individuals from various backgrounds to explore empathy through art creation, challenging stereotypes, and fostering connections through shared creativity. Similarly, \"Care Krisis\", a digital theatre collaboration between the UK and Indonesia, addressed the complex issue of aging populations, prompting global audiences to contemplate shared global challenges with empathetic eyes.\nNestled within the vibrant cultural landscape of Yogyakarta, \"The School of Hope'' embarked on its transformative journey, bringing together youth from the deaf community, Islamic boarding school students, and other marginalized backgrounds.\nThis unique project, spearheaded by PSBK (Indonesia) and The Paper Birds (UK), and supported by the British Council\u2019s Connections Through Culture grants, embraced art as a catalyst for exploring empathy, not just as an emotion but as a multifaceted concept with personal and societal implications.\nThrough a structured series of \"5 lessons\", the workshops skillfully blended cognitive, intuitive, and creative pathways. Interactive exercises like \"empathy mapping\" challenged participants to empathize with others\u2019 perspectives, while collaborative art-making provided a safe space for self-expression and shared experiences.\nOne young deaf participant noted how the program not only enhanced their communication skills but also deepened their understanding of other people\u2019s emotions, effectively breaking down barriers and building bridges of empathy across seemingly disparate backgrounds.\nTestimonies from participants highlighted how art transcended language and cultural differences, fostering genuine connections and a shared sense of humanity among individuals who may have never interacted otherwise.\n\"Care Krisis\" stands as a testament to the transformative potential of digital theatre in igniting global conversations on intricate issues. This innovative project brought together theatre companies Zoo Co (UK) and Sakatoya (Indonesia) to delve into the interconnected challenges of aging populations and their impact on both environmental sustainability and social care needs.\nLive performances in each country, seamlessly intertwined with pre-recorded video backdrops, created a captivating hybrid experience. Actors grappled with these pressing issues, their diverse cultural perspectives enriching the narrative and sparking audience reflection.\nOne reviewer commented that \"Care Krisis\" transcended mere entertainment, prompting viewers to \"consider the future we're building, not just for ourselves, but for generations to come.\" This digital collaboration illustrates how art transcends physical boundaries, nurturing empathy toward shared global challenges, and inspiring collective action through creative storytelling.\nWhile the potential of cross-cultural art collaborations is undeniable, hurdles exist, including language barriers, navigating cultural sensitivities, and funding limitations. However, proactive planning, cultural awareness training, collaborative problem-solving, and the dedication of passionate individuals and organizations can overcome these challenges.\nThe fabric of humanity is beautifully intricate, woven from countless threads of diverse cultures and perspectives. Fostering empathy, understanding, and collaboration is crucial for building a just and compassionate world.\nLet's champion cross-cultural art initiatives, bridging divides and sparking meaningful conversations. Through the transformative power of art, we can weave a tapestry of empathy, one brushstroke, one melody, one shared experience at a time, celebrating differences and paving the way for a brighter future for all.\nThe canvas is set, and the paints await. Join hands, share stories, and let art ignite the spark of empathy. Support collaborations, participate in workshops, and become an agent of understanding.\nTogether, we can paint a world where differences are embraced, not feared, and empathy guides us toward a future woven with compassion.\n***\nThe writer is the country director for Indonesia and director Southeast Asia at British Council\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Article\nBNPT, PNM strengthen collaboration to combat radicalism through economic empowerment\nMemories of Aceh Chinese: We too remember, we too belong\n\u2018Wong urip urup\u2019: Transforming collectivism into innovation\nMIT's blueprint and Indonesia's cultural challenges to achieve the 2045 vision\nPartnership for prosperity between Indonesia and Africa\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nMore in Opinion\nView more\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo\u2019s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?\nAcademia\nStop with the LGBTQ scapegoating\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nAcademia\nNavigating Indonesia-US relations amid global and domestic changes",

In particular, the Indonesian government has set an ambitious goal of achieving net zero emissions by 2060, the same year China also aims to achieve carbon neutrality.\n\"Today, I am happy to represent PT Indonesia Eco Capital in celebrating the signing of a cooperation agreement with China Carbon Neutral Development Group Limited to establish PT Zero Carbon Future Indonesia. This marks a significant step toward a brighter and more sustainable future,\" said Fiona Chaw, director of PT Indonesia Eco Capital.\nFiona continued by highlighting the importance of the two companies\u2019 shared efforts and focus on carbon trading, web portals, digital platforms and management consulting.\nShe also underlined the potential and importance of the new partnership in shaping a sustainable future for Indonesia, in line with the government\u2019s zero carbon goal.\nZhong Guoxing, CEO of CCNG, expressed his passionate and confident views on the partnership with Indonesia Eco Capital at the signing ceremony.\n\"China Carbon Neutral Development Group Limited has strong determination to be the executor of the Hong Kong-based Silk Road business strategy. The partnership with PT Indonesia Eco Capital is our strategic step in taking on a global role. We hope that sincere collaboration and combining the advantages of each company can produce abundant results,\" he said.\nHaji Surianto, newly appointed as president commissioner of PT Zero Carbon Future Indonesia, also welcomed the partnership.\n\"Zero Carbon Future Indonesia is an important step toward the future that aims to raise awareness in the community about the potential of carbon credits and the optimal ways to use them economically and sustainably,\" Haji said, explaining that the new partnership was not only about business.\n\"It's about advancing awareness of the importance of environmental sustainability for the betterment of society as a whole,\u201d he said.\nZero Carbon Future Indonesia would focus on using carbon credits as a vital tool for combating climate change, Haji said.\nIn a global context increasingly focused on emissions reduction, carbon credits are emerging as a potentially lucrative solution for companies and countries.\nSigning the cooperation agreement was just the beginning of a promising journey toward a greener and more sustainable Indonesia, Haji underlined.\nZero Carbon Future Indonesia promises to be a significant driver of change, with a potential to push both Indonesia and Chine to achieve their climate goals.\nThe collaboration serves as a shining example of the positive impact of cross-border partnerships in addressing global challenges, raising hope for a future in which businesses actively contribute to a zero carbon world.\nOpportunities in Indonesia\nMeanwhile, the Financial Services Authority (OJK) launched the Indonesia Carbon Exchange (IDXCarbon) on Sept. 26, 2023.\nPotential sources of carbon credits in Indonesia include natural, mangrove and protected forests, peatlands, forest reforestation and conservation and the use of electric vehicles. One carbon credit is equivalent to reducing 1 tonne of carbon emissions.\nPotential markets for the program include export-oriented companies that recognize the need to use carbon credits to market their products in carbon-conscious destination countries. The mining and smelting industries are also promising markets for carbon credit.\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Article\nIndonesia Eco Capital, CCNG collaborate on building Indonesia\u2019s net zero future\nXiaomi launches climate strategy, commits to reduce Greenhouse Gas Emission by 98%\nIndonesia, US to launch $50 million partnership toward 2030 carbon sink goal\nHow to address Asia Pacific\u2019s biodiversity crisis and encourage nature-positive growth\nBritain's zero-carbon power outstrips fossil fuels in 2019\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nMore in Front row\nView more\nFront Row\nThink Business, Think Hong Kong: Spotlighting Asia opportunities in Jakarta\nFront Row\nBPJS Kesehatan partners with stakeholders to build a fraud-free JKN ecosystem\nFront Row\nFore Coffee ends the year strong with hopeful prospects and locally focused products\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo\u2019s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?\nAcademia\nStop with the LGBTQ scapegoating\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nAcademia\nNavigating Indonesia-US relations amid global and domestic changes",

One of the most pressing challenges is the transition to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all, as encapsulated by SDG 7. Without a significant acceleration of effort, reaching SDG 7 and its targets for energy access, renewable energy and energy efficiency will elude our region. Given the significance of Asia and the Pacific in terms of global energy supply and consumption, actions taken here will set the tone for the global trajectory of progress on SDG 7 and the fight against climate change.\nThe United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific will place these issues at center stage during this week\u2019s Asian and Pacific Energy Forum. This meeting will provide a platform for the region\u2019s energy ministers to plan a regional agenda for a sustainable energy transition.\nLooming large among these issues is the lack of access to electricity and clean cooking fuels for hundreds of millions of people. This deprivation has far-reaching consequences, and is a harsh reminder that, while the region has made significant strides in economic development, not everyone has enjoyed the fruits of progress.\nLack of access to electricity hinders healthcare, education and economic opportunities.

This is the first regional online shopping event held by the bloc, and it provided a platform for ASEAN enterprises, especially micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), to promote their products through e-commerce channels.\nA wide range of electronics, handicrafts and fashion products from ASEAN countries were on display, highlighting the vibrancy of ASEAN businesses and conveying the message that ASEAN is committed to developing cross-border e-commerce.\nOnline shopping, including international online shopping, has long been an integral part of daily life in China. Many ASEAN products, such as coffee and shrimp chips from Indonesia and durian from Thailand, are hot sellers on China's e-commerce platforms.\nThis year, the \u201cBrand and Quality Online Shopping Festival\u201d held by China has created the \u201cASEAN offerings\u201d activity, which promotes ASEAN\u2019s specialty products on the Chinese market through special online events and live streaming.\nThe digital economy has changed the way people live and represents the future of the global economy. For developing countries, the digital economy is an opportunity to enliven the consumer market, create new growth points, empower industrial transformation and upgrading, give rise to new business models and promote high-quality development.\nChina and ASEAN are both highlands of digital economy development. China is a leader in the digital economy, at the forefront of digital infrastructure, smart cities and digital government resources, as well as several world-class digital enterprises.\nIn 2022, China's digital economy reached 50.2 trillion yuan (US$6.9 trillion), ranking second globally, and the country's online retail sales amounted to 13.79 trillion yuan, ranking first in the world.\nASEAN's digital economy has seen rapid developing in recent years, showing great potential, with the accelerated rollout of digital platforms and digital technologies in many countries, and booming development of industries such as e-commerce, transportation applications and online services. By the end of June 2022, half of the world's 10 fastest-growing countries in terms of online retail sales, including the top three, were ASEAN members. ASEAN is expected to be among the world's top five digital economies by 2025.\nChina and ASEAN are natural partners in digital economy development. The ASEAN market has already attracted some leading Chinese digital enterprises, including e-commerce platforms such as Alibaba, Tencent and Jingdong, mobile payment enterprises such as Ant Group, digital information enterprises such as Huawei and ZTE and some courier and logistics enterprises.\nThese Chinese enterprises have cooperated with partners in ASEAN countries to promote advanced technologies and mature business models within ASEAN, and they have assisted Southeast Asia in building digital economic ecosystems that promote the rapid rise of local digital enterprises such as Shopee, Lazada and Tokopedia, which has greatly driven the development of ASEAN's digital industry and the construction of its digital interconnectivity.\nBecause of geographic proximity, people-to-people affinity, integrated economies and highly complementary industries, China and ASEAN members are highly compatible in terms of digital economy development planning and industrial needs. The digital economy will be a new \u201cblue ocean\u201d in China-ASEAN economic and trade cooperation, creating many opportunities.\nAt the ASEAN-China Special Summit to Commemorate the 30\nth\nanniversary of ASEAN-China Dialogue Relations in 2022, China and ASEAN established a comprehensive strategic partnership, and Chinese President Xi Jinping emphasized that China would expand cooperation in the digital economy with ASEAN.\nSince then, the two sides have been accelerating digital cooperation, gradually improving strategic alignment and speeding up the implementation of the Initiative on Building ASEAN-China Partnership on Digital Economy. More than half of ASEAN member states have signed bilateral e-commerce cooperation memorandums with China and established the \"Silk Road E-commerce\" cooperation mechanism.\nNew chapters on the digital economy that are included in the ongoing negotiations on the Version 3.0 China-ASEAN Free Trade Area, and an initiative on deepening e-commerce cooperation will be published at the upcoming China-ASEAN Leaders\u2019 Summit.\nIn addition, China and the Southeast Asian bloc have utilized platforms such as the China-ASEAN Expo and the China-ASEAN Information Port to vigorously promote cooperation on projects in the fields of digital government, digital enterprises, digital industries and new communications.\nThis year marks the 10\nth\nanniversary of President Xi\u2019s proposal to build a closer China-ASEAN community with a shared future through the Belt and Road Initiative. China will use this as an opportunity to plan for cooperation in areas such as the digital economy with ASEAN and other countries involved in the Belt and Road Initiative.\nThis year, Indonesia, as ASEAN's rotating chair, has adopted the theme \"ASEAN Matters: Epicentrum of Growth\" and chosen digital economy cooperation as one of the priority agendas. At this historic juncture linking past achievements with prospects, China and ASEAN should work together to embrace and promote the new era of the digital economy.\nWe need to further strengthen the synergy of digital development strategies, enhance digital connectivity and build an integrated China-ASEAN digital market. We need to promote an exchange of experience and capacity-building training and improve rulemaking by agreeing on high-level digital rules.\nWe should push for lower tariffs, more efficient customs clearance, more connected payment methods and faster logistics and transportation so that more ordinary people and enterprises can enjoy the benefits of digital economy development.\nNext month, Jakarta will host the bloc\u2019s leaders\u2019 meetings on East Asia cooperation. We are ready to work with ASEAN countries at the meetings to promote fruitful results and push China-ASEAN digital economy cooperation to a new level.\n&nbsp;***\nThe author is Chinese Ambassador to ASEAN.\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Article\nNavigating Indonesia-US relations amid global and domestic changes\nAmerica's tech blind spot\nXi, Biden attend APEC summit, prepare to meet\nExploring the interplay of human, nature and technology at 2024 Singapore Writers Festival\nUN biodiversity summit making 'very good progress': Officials\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nMore in Paper\nView more\nOpinion\nAnalysis: Govt adopts mandatory B35 biodiesel program as CPO prices tumble\nBusiness\nGlobal chip crunch stunts Indonesia car sales recovery\nBusiness\nXL profit falls in Q3 as tower sale income dries\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo\u2019s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?\nAcademia\nStop with the LGBTQ scapegoating\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nAcademia\nNavigating Indonesia-US relations amid global and domestic changes",

Among other topics, the country has spotlighted the acceleration of the transformation of early childhood education (PAUD).\nCalling on all member countries to collaborate, Indonesia reminded the region to strengthen its shared commitment to improving children\u2019s education and bring an end to the lag in learning and development in early childhood, which was exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAs part of its commitment to PAUD, the government, through the Education, Culture, Research and Technology Ministry, continues to be consistent in modifying the curriculum to make it more responsive to new challenges, develop more varied learning methods and open opportunities for multi-sector collaboration involving the private sector.\nThe new initiative was explained by the director general for early childhood, elementary and secondary education, Iwan Syahril, in the Early Childhood Education Policy Dialogue in ASEAN or the Southeast Asia Policy Dialogue on Early Childhood Care and Education (SEA PD on ECCE) forum. The forum was held in Jakarta on Tuesday and was attended by education ministers from 11 Southeast Asian countries, ambassadors from Southeast Asian countries to Indonesia and hundreds of delegates.\nIwan said it was necessary to design a curriculum that had resilience in supporting sustainable development, as well as one that taught children about the current global society, gender equality, climate change and inclusive education so as to support the availability of PAUD services that were resilient in facing various challenges in the future.\n\u201cI hope that today's conference will be an opportunity for ASEAN countries to unite various ideas by sharing good practices in the provision of quality early childhood services. Together we can build a better future, starting with a stronger commitment to improving the quality of PAUD services,\" said Iwan, noting that the conference was part of a policy dialogue in Southeast Asia on PAUD.\nThis is Indonesia\u2019s fifth time hosting ASEAN. The country\u2019s previous chairmanship of the bloc was in 2011. This year, the country chose the theme, \"ASEAN Matters: Epicentrum of Growth\", which expresses Indonesia's hope of raising the relevance and role of ASEAN in regional and global progress.\nOn Tuesday, Indonesia, through the education ministry, supported by the ASEAN Secretariat and the Southeast Asian Ministers of Education Organization Center for Early Childhood Care Education and Parenting (SEAMEO CECCEP), welcomed the arrival of 200 participants consisting of education ministers, ambassadors from Southeast Asian countries, as well as hundreds of delegates and speakers at the St. Regis Jakarta for the conference.\nPrior to this discussion, the education ministry also had the pleasure of leading the Group of 20 Working Group on Education, as Indonesia acted as the group\u2019s president in 2022, before handing over the reins to India. Through international forums, the ministry highlighted the Merdeka Belajar (freedom to learn) curriculum, which transforms and strengthens mutual cooperation and commitment in efforts to accelerate the transformation of PAUD and recover from the learning and growth lag after the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, in the spirit of\ngotong royong\n(mutual cooperation), Indonesia reiterates the need for collaboration between all stakeholders in order to ensure success.\nTo tackle the setback that was brought on by the pandemic, the ministry proposed a few solutions, such as the provision and implementation of quality early childhood education that is inclusive through proper planning, monitoring and evaluation.\nThe process of transitioning from PAUD to elementary school, as an important part of the Merdeka Belajar program, is also vital in determining the success of the PAUD transformation and should be done delicately and as easily as possible for the students. Another main focus of particular concern is ensuring the collaboration of the PAUD ecosystem, including schools, local government, teachers, parents and the community.\nIf there is one thing that has always been implemented in ASEAN, it is the cross-country cooperation that has been witnessed by Indonesia and other member countries in the region. Iwan expressed his appreciation to the speakers involved in the plenary and parallel sessions who came, both locally and from other countries, such as New Zealand, Japan, Canada, the Philippines, Brunei Darussalam, Malaysia, Thailand, Laos, Singapore, Cambodia and Vietnam.\nFurthermore, Iwan also expressed his gratitude to the entire committee, consisting of the ASEAN Secretariat, the Directorate of Early Childhood Education, the Directorate General of PDM Ministry of Education and Culture, SEAMEO CECCEP, the TANOTO Foundation and the Asia-Pacific Regional Network for Early Childhood (ARNEC).\n\"I realize that without good cooperation, it would be impossible for us to hold this event. Without the commitment and high enthusiasm of the committee, the first ECCE conference and declaration at the ministerial level in the Southeast Asia region would not have been possible. Therefore, I really appreciate the involvement of all ladies and gentlemen in this conference,\" he said.\nThe education ministry, representing Indonesia, hopes that the participants can make the Regional Consultation Meeting on Declaration on Early Childhood Care and Education forum a part of the PAUD Policy Dialogue in ASEAN a productive space to collaborate with each other in transforming and improving the quality of PAUD services in the Southeast Asian region.\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Article\nAPRIL Group improves children\u2019s health, education access in Riau for Human Rights Day\nGovt develops mechanism to help teachers obtain associate, bachelor's degrees\nChinese guards on the ground in Myanmar could go disastrously wrong\nIndonesia to attend ASEAN ministers\u2019 meeting on Myanmar\nICC\u2019s arrest warrant for Myanmar junta chief is a critical step forward\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nMore in Front Row\nView more\nFront Row\nThink Business, Think Hong Kong: Spotlighting Asia opportunities in Jakarta\nFront Row\nBPJS Kesehatan partners with stakeholders to build a fraud-free JKN ecosystem\nFront Row\nFore Coffee ends the year strong with hopeful prospects and locally focused products\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo\u2019s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?\nAcademia\nStop with the LGBTQ scapegoating\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nAcademia\nNavigating Indonesia-US relations amid global and domestic changes",

(Antara/Galih Pradipta)\nIn 2015, world leaders committed to providing health services for all people by 2030. In 2023, the world is only halfway toward meeting the target set by the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of achieving universal health coverage by 2030.\nMore effort, from implementation to investment in health, is needed to meet this globally agreed goal.\nConsider some figures.\nBefore the COVID-19 pandemic, the World Health Organization estimated that low- and middle-income countries needed to increase their health spending significantly to reach the health-related SDGs, with an additional US$371 billion annually combined required by 2030. This funding would allow populations to access health services, contribute to building new facilities and train and place health workers where they need to be.\nLately, however, a host of additional factors are increasing the need for additional funding to achieve universal health coverage, such as disruptions to health services caused by conflict, climate change and economic instability.\nIt has also been estimated that preparing for future pandemics will require massive investment in the order of US$31.1 billion annually, with approximately one-third required from international financing.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nTemporary increases in government spending driven up by the pandemic response contributed to a rise in global health spending in the neighborhood of $9 trillion in 2020. That is nearly 11 percent of gross domestic product. Public spending accounted for about 63 percent of this amount.\nWhile public spending will remain the main source of health funding, it will be difficult for countries to find the funds required to meet the ambitious goal of universal health coverage. At the same time, the world economy is under strain, as are national budgets. Development assistance will also likely feel the squeeze. Health services need new sources of funding, and innovative products that can help marshal the resources of the private sector.\nThe challenge is enormous. Individual countries cannot solve the healthcare conundrum on their own. We need global solidarity and collective efforts.\nFor this reason, the African Development Bank, the European Investment Bank (EIB), the Islamic Development Bank and the World Health Organization (WHO) are launching a new investment platform to mobilize more impactful and coherent investments in primary health care (PHC) systems in individual countries and to improve countries\u2019 resilience. We are also channeling resources from other partners, such as the European Commission, to remove the risk from these investments and to make the conditions highly attractive for beneficiary countries.\nAs this is a global challenge, the Inter-American Development Bank, the leading source of development finance for Latin America and the Caribbean, is also considering joining this partnership in view of extending this initiative to the region.\nWhy focus on primary health care? Around 90 percent of essential health services can be delivered through quality primary health care that is closer to communities, via health professionals, doctors and nurses, in local clinics to promote health and prevent diseases. This will avert the need for more costly secondary and tertiary services. Essentially, primary health care reaches even the most rural and remote locations, and also serves as the \"eyes and ears\" of a country\u2019s health system.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and resulting economic crisis taught us that investing in health services that can reach all is central to national security, development and prosperity. It also reminded us that solidarity and equity are integral parts of any health service solution. Cooperation between multilateral organizations and development banks is key to addressing these challenges.&nbsp;\nThis kind of cooperation proved fruitful during the pandemic. The WHO, the EIB and the European Commission worked closely with Angola, Ethiopia, the occupied Palestinian territory, and Rwanda to strengthen their health systems. Initiated as stand-alone programs, in the case of Ethiopia or Palestine, or as part of the response to COVID-19 in Angola and Rwanda, these interventions mobilized technical assistance, grants, and investments with advantageous terms to bulk up primary health care.\nFor example, in Rwanda, WHO is directly advising the government on rebuilding the country\u2019s National Health Laboratory, with financing from the European Commission and the EIB. The new laboratory, connecting to lab services at primary healthcare levels, will be able to perform more than 80 000 free-of-charge tests or analyses each year, serving more than 12 million people in the country.\nOur cooperation will help guide investments by national governments to strengthen primary health care and their overall health systems. It will increase universal health coverage and improve their ability to prepare for, prevent and respond to health emergencies. We will work with countries individually to identify gaps in national health systems. We will support them as they design interventions and investment strategies, find funding, implement projects, and monitor their impact.\nWe will focus on driving measurable impact on people\u2019s health outcomes by using innovative finance mechanisms to spur domestic funding and contribute to promoting our shared goal of health for all, without pushing countries into unsustainable debt.\nWe will launch this new investment platform in Paris at the Summit on a New Global Financing Pact (June 22-23), with a call to generate needed finances to fight inequalities in health and other fields, to finance the climate transition, and to accelerate progress on the SDGs.\nGood health and well-being are common goals that the whole world shares.\nTo achieve such goals, however, countries and institutions must work together. As we strengthen our collaboration, we are convinced that cooperation \u2013 between nations, as well as between governments and the private sector \u2013 is critical to achieving universal health coverage.\nWe call on our partners to join this global investment platform.\n&nbsp;***\nTedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus is director-general of the World Health Organization.

(Antara/KCIC)\nC\nhina on Tuesday unveiled its blueprint for a better world, raised by President Xi Jinping in 2013, through a policy paper on building a global community of shared future.\nChina also said it will continue to push for green development in Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) projects, rejecting accusations that it has outsourced its environmental pollution, a senior official from China\u2019s top economic planner said at a press conference on the wide-ranging policy paper about China\u2019s global vision.\nThe White Paper titled \u201cA Global Community of Shared Future: China\u2019s Proposals and Actions\u201d comes a decade after the vision was first proposed by Xi, and has been presented as his alternative to the current Western-led world order, with an emphasis on what it calls Chinese-style diplomacy and various global initiatives.\nThis year also marks the 10th anniversary of the BRI, and China will host the third Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation in October, with leaders and representatives from some 130 countries set to attend, including Russian President Vladimir Putin.\nBy July 2023, more than three-quarters of countries in the world and over 30 international organizations had signed agreements on Belt and Road cooperation with China, the White Paper said.\nIssued by the State Council Information Office, the White Paper said the vision rises above the exclusive rules of bloc politics, the notion of \u201cmight makes right\u201d and the \u201cuniversal values\u201d defined by a handful of Western countries.\nChina has contributed to building a global community of shared future with actions including promoting high-quality Belt and Road cooperation, state news agency Xinhua said on Tuesday.\nAt the press conference, in a rare appearance beyond his usual annual press conference in March, Foreign Minister Wang Yi said that by putting forward the creative idea, President Xi has shown \u201cthe correct path for the world\u201d, building a strong consensus for international cooperation.\nChina has also proposed solutions to major global challenges in fields such as health, climate change and cyber security, Wang added.\nHe said Beijing was willing to play a \u201cconstructive\u201d role in the success of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in November in San Francisco, US.\nIt paves the way for a possible meeting between Xi and US President Joe Biden \u2013 both presidents last met on the sidelines of the Group of 20 (G20) leaders\u2019 summit in November 2022 in Bali.\nXi did not attend the G20 summit in India earlier this month, missing an opportunity to meet Biden, and prompting the US to say China was \u201cgiving up\u201d on the G20 and building an alternative world order.\n\u201cOf course, we and all parties also hope that the United States will realize its responsibilities as a host, show due openness, fairness, tolerance and responsibility, and create better conditions for the smooth holding of the meeting,\u201d Wang said, referring to the APEC&nbsp;summit.\nEarlier on Tuesday, Hong Kong Chief Executive John Lee said he had yet to receive any invitation to the November meeting. It follows US media reports in July that he had been barred from the meetings after being sanctioned by Washington for what it calls his role in cracking down on civil liberties in the Asian financial hub.\nWang repeated a frequent Chinese warning that China opposes \u201cwanton expansion of military alliances\u201d and the squeezing of the security space of other countries.\nBeijing has been critical of Washington\u2019s continued attempts to increase military cooperation in the Indo-Pacific region, including the Quad and the AUKUS&nbsp;groupings. It particularly disagrees with bases that are being built by the US in the north of the Philippines.\nDialogue between China and the US has been gradually resuming despite continued tensions, with several high-level visits to Beijing in recent months by top US officials, including Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo.\nMeanwhile, not all is rosy with China\u2019s BRI, which has come under widespread criticism for causing environmental destruction in project areas, including building coal-fired power plants overseas despite a national commitment domestically to reach peak carbon output by 2030, and to be carbon-neutral by 2060.\nEarlier this year,\na report\nin\nThe Jakarta Post\nsaid the Batang Toru hydropower project, which is 70 percent owned by Chinese-owned State Development and Investment Corporation\u2019s subsidiary SDIC Power, encroached on the habitat of the endangered Tapanuli orangutan, forcing them to intrude on nearby farms and villages.\nRead also:\nChina\u2019s big firms put reputation at risk in Batang Toru power plant\n\u201cThe joint construction of the \u2018Belt and Road\u2019 projects are carried out based on the principle of extensive consultation, joint construction and shared benefits,\u201d Cong Liang, deputy director of the National Development and Reform Commission said in response to a question from\nThe Straits Times\nat the press conference.\n\u201cWhether the development is green or not, I think the [partner country]&nbsp;knows best, the local people have the most say, and facts are always more convincing than words.\u201d\nIt is \u201cnot worth refuting\u201d the voices that slander the Green Silk Road \u2013 an initiative to make BRI projects more ecologically sustainable \u2013 and those who attempt to smear and interfere with joint projects will not succeed, he added.\nTouting the success of the BRI, officials said projects such as\nthe high-speed rail between Jakarta and Bandung\n, the Phnom Penh-Sihanoukville Expressway, and the Greek port of Piraeus have increased connectivity, rejuvenating the local economy with jobs and trade.\n\u201cIn the next step, the NDRC will work with relevant departments\u2026 (and) continue to build high-quality landmark projects, promote \u2018small but beautiful\u2019 projects, deepen cooperation in key areas such as infrastructure and people\u2019s livelihood projects to achieve complementary advantages, mutual benefits and win-win results,\u201d Cong said.\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Article\nNavigating Indonesia-US relations amid global and domestic changes\nRussia teams up with BRICS to create AI alliance\nIndonesia must regain credibility as an honest broker\nXi, Biden attend APEC summit, prepare to meet\nPeru's Chancay: China's megaport of entry to South America\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nMore in World\nView more\nEurope\nUS announces new arms aid package for Ukraine worth $500 million\nMiddle East and Africa\nUS says Israel is acting in Syria for its own defence\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia welcomes UNGA resolution on immediate ceasefire in Gaza\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo\u2019s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?\nAcademia\nStop with the LGBTQ scapegoating\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nAcademia\nNavigating Indonesia-US relations amid global and domestic changes",

(AFP/Tang Chhin Sothy)\nE\nurope, once a theatre of internecine wars, now has a robust European Union shaping the common destiny of its people. Although Europe is only a subcontinent of Asia as Arnold Toynbee had observed and as is visible to anyone looking at a map, we still not have a common Asian platform for economic and political cooperation.\nIt is high time Asia had its well mandated regional organization to secure a common Asian future, ending the costly hostilities and political egos. We can have the Asian Union even when the bilateral hostilities, unique to Asia, refuse to go away completely.\nAsia is the only continent where there are live hostilities today: India-Pakistan and South-North Koreas; the conflicts in a few West Asia countries are, however, not openly bilateral. The China-Japan rift is more emotional than anything and could be more readily surmounted through sensible diplomatic endeavors.&nbsp;\nThe congenital rivalry within the two sets of twin sisters \u2013 India-Pakistan and South-North Koreas \u2013 may take more time to resolve, but would definitely be resolved in mutual interest once the common gains are in view and a once matured, forward looking political leadership is there to steer&nbsp; the respective countries. A pan Asian Union would make peace and economic progress in the region real.\nLook at the history of Europe. Countries have been forming and reforming there for the greater part of its history. Violence was a daily reality in most of the prosperous countries of today. Factional disputes within its imported religion of Christianity \u2013 an Asian religion \u2013 was good enough for countries of Europe to go to war for a good part of its latter history. And to engender violence within its societies too.\nInternal conflicts and violence within the European boarders drastically reduced with the launch of imperialist onslaughts. They shifted the theatres of war and violence to the rest of the world, turning most of Asia into its victim.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nEurope changed this rule only with the first and second pan European wars, wrongly called world wars, and the second big war devastated the warring imperial countries militarily and economically, to our good fortune, resulting in their departure from the countries they had occupied.\nIf the countries of Europe whose history is rightly be termed savage, could shed their hostility, end wars and eventually give up a large part of their respective national sovereignty to create the powerful EU, cant the countries of Asia unite in our common interest. Incidentally, it is worth noting that the EU was created in 1993, marking 500 years of Colombus\u2019 invasion of what was later called America and the subsequent occupation of the continent. The treaty signing was not held in 1992, the exact year of five centuries, to provide time for the political leaders and diplomats to engage in the Earth Summit process of that year.\nThere are greater reasons for Asia to unite than Europe had. To overcome the entrenched poverty, to build our economies based on our vast resources, to realize the potential of the immense human talent available, to protect the natural environment and more importantly to keep Asia peaceful and free of external interference.\nA collective Asian position on economic issues in the negotiations with the West can end the skewed trade relations and mark an end to the post-colonial exploitation.\nAsia is home to the ancient civilizations of the Arabs, India, China and Persia; it produced all the religions practiced on earth as well as Confucianism. The West has nothing even remotely comparable to the tremendous cultural, ethnic and linguistic diversity of Asia. It has not colonized countries \u2013 with the aberration of Japan, but has been victim of all the predatory imperialists of Europe and suffered massive theft of its resources.\nAsia has survived the imperial onslaught, bounced back and chartered its development course that is already yielding remarkable results. And it is time to take it forward by forging political and economic alliance across the region.\nAsia already has two good precedents to build upon: ASEAN in the east and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) in the west. Both these bodies are fairly concrete groupings and have yielded valuable lessons to their respective members in regional collectivity. The acronyms ASEAN and GCC appear on the daily conversations of the peoples of the respective regions.\nThe South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) had a modest start and continues to remain weak. The Shanghai Cooperation Organization is emerging as a strong regional body with its expanded membership that includes Russia, and deepening its agenda progressively.\nAll these experiences can be creatively applied to establish a pan Asian body of 48 countries for political and economic cooperation.\nOne reason why Africa has no wars or self-defeating hostility between countries is, in great measure, the influence of the African Union. When Asia attains that level of maturity the world shall be a better place. The threat of NATO in the region can be avoided and the incongruous Quad can be done away with. Countries can trade among them in a number of currencies of the region and people can travel without visas.\nOur democracies are at different stages of development; however, nearly all are on the trajectory toward maturity. The Asian Union can accelerate the process of deepening democracy across the region as the economic and social dividends of democracy would then become more obvious.&nbsp;\nJapan may not be initially enthusiastic about the Asian Union due to its dependence on the US on foreign policy, but once convinced that the US is actually a dispensable burden and that the Chinese threat is largely imaginary they would want to join too.\nThe statute of the new union could be designed in a way that the reach of its mandate and the coverage of subjects could be incremental, and allowing room for accommodating the differences across countries. Europe\u2019s experience vividly tells us that the neighboring country\u2019s progress and one\u2019s own is inextricably linked, which should be a compelling reason to shed hostility and envy toward the neighbors.\nThe government leaders, given to conventional thinking, may take a long time to address the goal of an Asian union. It would be the role of the civil society, political movements and the progressive media to take this up on their agenda and build a people\u2019s movement to create the Asian Union.\n&nbsp;***\nThe writer is an international environmental policy specialist and a United Nations environmental negotiator\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Article\n2024 will be the hottest year on record, EU scientists say\nBali as a \u2018living mystery school\u2019\nUnderstanding Trump in the MAGA 2.0\nEast Asia, ASEAN and Pacific demand Prabowo\u2019s attention\nTime for ASEAN to have an easy-to-implement geostrategy\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nMore in Opinion\nView more\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo\u2019s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?\nAcademia\nStop with the LGBTQ scapegoating\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nAcademia\nNavigating Indonesia-US relations amid global and domestic changes",

The war is happening right as simultaneously, Indonesia is at the helm of the Group of 20. It is Indonesia\u2019s destiny to navigate the complex situation as it holds presidency of the world\u2019s most prestigious mechanism on economics and finance.\nHistorically, Indonesia has been successful in hosting and chairing many prestigious international meetings, such as the Asia-Africa Conference in Bandung, West Java; the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Bogor, West Java; Bali\u2019s climate conference; and numerous ASEAN\u2019s landmark agreements contributing to regional peace, stability and prosperity, including the launch of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), the world\u2019s largest trade agreement, when chairing ASEAN in 2011.\nThese events highlight Indonesia\u2019s leadership and consistency in implementing its foreign policy, which aims to contribute to world peace, security, friendship and partnership.\nThe G20 was established as the world\u2019s primary inclusive global economic and financial platform bringing together all parties from developed and new emerging economies with their diverse views to deliberate and adopt global policy measures. As a trillion dollar economy and the world\u2019s 16\nth\nlargest, and as a country that emerged from the devastating 1998 financial crisis with the prestigious status as the world\u2019s third largest democracy, Indonesia\u2019s membership comes with responsibilities.\nReeling from the Asian financial crisis, Indonesia recovered stronger and envisions becoming the world\u2019s seventh largest economy by 2030 while promoting democracy, human rights, sustainable development and multilateralism.\nThe theme of Indonesia\u2019s G20 presidency, \u201cRecover together, recover stronger\u201d, represents the country\u2019s responsibility to embrace all in its bid to bounce back from the pandemic. It adopts three concrete, deliverable priorities, which are not only in Indonesia\u2019s interests, but are common global priorities: health, energy transition and digital transformation. The theme clearly represents the leadership\u2019s aim of ensuring the G20\u2019s relevance for everyone -- north and south, rich and poor.\nThe first priority underscores the fact that the pandemic has taught us all crucial lessons in how unprepared we are -- whether developing or developed countries -- and how divisive the narratives when unity is urgently needed.\nThe pandemic and geopolitical tension formed a perfect storm when distrust grew and unity was absent. Divisive rhetoric and exchanges of accusations were the dominant narratives, instead of collaboration.\nGalvanizing global solidarity, therefore, is the consistent narrative of President Joko \u201cJokowi\u201d Widodo, who insists that \u201cno one should be left behind\u201d on vaccination and access to medications.\nAs an emerging economy and non-producing country of vaccines, Indonesia has managed to secure and vaccinate 70 percent of its population in slightly over a year. Despite progress, Indonesia continues forging global solidarity to achieve the World Health Organization\u2019s vaccination target of 70 percent of the global population this year. As the acting G20 president, Jokowi will make sure the pandemic is addressed, the economy recovers and the world is well prepared for future pandemics.\nSecond, not long ago, world leaders put pressure on emerging economies like Indonesia to be more ambitious in their emission reduction targets to reach net zero by 2050. Despite lack of implementation on their part, developed countries again reaffirmed the Paris Commitment to US$100 billion financing annually. Many are now worried that financing the devastating geopolitical conflict will replace financing to address the climate crisis.\nWe should not allow this to happen and should stick to our collective efforts to address the climate crisis for all, including for our future generations.\nTherefore, energy transition is among Indonesia\u2019s G20 priorities, despite its being a costly undertaking, especially for Indonesia, a country blessed with coal and fossil fuel resources. Indonesia\u2019s leading by example announced by Jokowi at Glasgow Climate Summit was solid evidence of Indonesia\u2019s determination to walk the talk.\nTo illustrate how costly it is, US$3.8 billon is needed merely to compensate Indonesia\u2019s transition of 5.4 gigawatts of coal power. Indonesia understands this yet remains committed to move forward. Indonesia\u2019s success in significantly slashing the deforestation rate in the past years has improved its confidence to launch the forest and other land uses (FOLU) net sink by 2030. Ambitious peatland and mangrove restoration has progressed significantly and will place Indonesia as a potential carbon sequestration market.\nThe third priority is digital transformation. We remember when digitalization disrupted many things, bringing anxiety and distress. But thanks to Indonesia\u2019s democratic environment and vibrant young demography, digital transformation is now vast and has produced a number of unicorns and decacorns. Democracy and freedom are conducive preconditions for creativity and innovation to flourish. We also understand the challenges of digitalization and its potential threat to peace and security, as in the cases of hoaxes, disinformation and cybercrimes. Therefore, G20 deliberation on this topic should ensure digital transformation is relevant and beneficial to all.\nIndonesia\u2019s firm and consistent approach -- \u201cRecover together, recover stronger\u201d -- is a testament to its pledge to keep the G20 credible and relevant for all. It should remain working in a spirit of multilateralism to promote dialogue and inclusiveness.\nThe geopolitical conflict is devastating, therefore a conducive environment should be created to put the fight to an end. Putting significant pressure on Indonesia is simply unfair when it is trying to salvage the G20 and its relevance to all, particularly developing countries. Many understand this stance, but some fail to do so.\nPressuring, and even bullying Indonesia for its stance is misrepresentation. Indonesia does not have the prerogative to invite or disinvite G20 members. It should be a collective decision of all members. But Indonesia has the right to invite guests, and therefore Jokowi has invited the president of Ukraine.\nThe success of the G20 summit is certainly desirable, not only for Indonesia, but for the whole international community, particularly developing countries. Jokowi and Foreign Minister Retno LP Marsudi have repeatedly called for an immediate stop to the war in Ukraine and respect for territorial integrity. Negotiation and diplomacy should be given their primacy.\nOnly history will tell whether Indonesia has made the right decision to choose dialogue over conflict, partnership over hostility and diplomacy over war mongering. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n&nbsp;***\nThe writer is the director general of American and European Affairs at the Indonesian Foreign Ministry; the views expressed are his own.\n&nbsp;\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Article\nRI identifies 29 potential nuclear power plant sites\nLula 'stable' after emergency surgery\nPutin\u2019s India visit aims to shape global multipolarity\nGovt to review PIK 2\u2019s spatial planning amid land use concerns\nNo new impetus seen for JETP under Trump\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nMore in Paper\nView more\nOpinion\nAnalysis: Govt adopts mandatory B35 biodiesel program as CPO prices tumble\nBusiness\nGlobal chip crunch stunts Indonesia car sales recovery\nBusiness\nXL profit falls in Q3 as tower sale income dries\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo\u2019s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?\nAcademia\nStop with the LGBTQ scapegoating\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nAcademia\nNavigating Indonesia-US relations amid global and domestic changes",

Given the exceptional situation, President Emmanuel Macron wanted instead to pay tribute to those who are engaged in the fight against COVID-19 around the world. By this choice, France wants to show its solidarity with European and international partners affected by the health crisis.\nIndonesia is a major partner for France in Southeast Asia. Our countries are united by bonds of friendship and since 2011, by a strategic partnership based on common values \u200b\u200bsuch as democracy, human rights, tolerance and pluralism within society, and the conception of a secure, law-based international order that we are engaging to strengthen today.\nFacing the growing challenges of globalization, peace and security, be it climate change, the fight against terrorism, radicalism and extremism, disarmament, non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction or health, our two countries recognize the leading role played by the United Nations and other multilateral international organizations.\nIn the Indo-Pacific region, France and Indonesia promote the same vision of an inclusive and open space, in which France intends to contribute to regional stability and growth by strengthening its partnerships in three sectors: maritime cooperation, connectivity and sustainable development (Sustainable Development Goals), fully in line with the priorities of Indonesia and ASEAN, a central player in regional architecture.\nUnpredictable, deadly and long-lasting, the COVID-19 crisis makes us realize that to face a pandemic, only a collective response is effective. There is a need to strengthen multilateralism and international cooperation, France and Indonesia are fully committing in order to better prevent and overcome future crises.\nIt is an ambitious and demanding project that must be driven by common values. In this regard, the spirit of July 14, which we celebrate in France, can be instilled in this momentum. In 1789, our ancestors were convinced that freedom, equality and fraternity should guide all of humanity and that these ideals would achieve full meaning if they were applied to all, beyond borders. Republican universalism was on the move and history has shown that these values \u200b\u200bunite us, especially during harsh times.\nAs President Macron pointed out, the current situation leads us to reinvent ourselves, to be bold and creative, without which decline is looming. This is why France is undertaking reconstruction, be it economic, ecological or social. It is supported by the European Union, which has also taken unprecedented measures with a plan of 540 billion euro (US$609.92 billion).\nWe are working with our European partners on a targeted stimulus fund to support the recovery, which is expected to amount to 750 billion euro. In addition, there is a debt buyback plan by the European Central Bank for 1.45 trillion euro.\nFrance has thus taken ambitious measures to face the crisis, with a rescue plan representing 5 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) and 315 billion euro in guarantees for businesses. Furthermore, there are sector plans for aeronautics, automotive industry and tourism and a recovery plan to be presented in the fall by the new government. The challenge is above all to preserve the productive apparatus to allow a rebound once the crisis has been overcome.\nAs members of the Group of 20, France and Indonesia are working together to find a coordinated response to revive economy, trade and investment already damaged by the trade war between the two largest economies in the world.\nThe 200 subsidiaries of French companies present in Indonesia remained during the crisis and will resume their investments. They have a lot to offer in the new sectors after COVID-19, especially in healthcare and digital. In order to facilitate recovery, it is more necessary than ever to continue negotiations between the EU and Indonesia for a free trade agreement (EU-CEPA).\nFrance is Indonesia\u2019s third-largest donor of bilateral public aid. Our development bank, the French Development Agency (AFD), has already proposed to commit $110 million to support the Indonesian budgetary effort in the fight against COVID-19, and we are ready to do more by using the diversity of our financial tools.\nHere again, adaptation will be the keyword, in all sectors. France, like Indonesia, can boast of a strong cultural industry and a dynamic artistic scene. Despite the health crisis and the closure to the public of the four French Institutes and the two Alliances Fran\u00e7aises in Indonesia, hundreds of Indonesian students have benefited from new online courses and from cultural events like La F\u00eate de la Musique (Festival of Music) through digital media.\nBesides, between Nov. 2 and Nov. 15, as part of the celebrations for the 70\nth\nanniversary of diplomatic relations between Indonesia and France, the vIDeo // heritage.fr project will offer an exciting simultaneous multimedia exhibition in six emblematic monuments from six Indonesian cities (Jakarta, Bandung in West Java, Yogyakarta, Surabaya in East Java, Medan in North Sumatra and Ubud in Bali).\nIn terms of education, the first bilingual class in Indonesia welcomed its students to the Labschool Cibubur high school in West Java on Saturday.

Given the exceptional situation, President Emmanuel Macron wanted instead to pay tribute to those who are engaged in the fight against COVID-19 around the world. By this choice, France wants to show its solidarity with European and international partners affected by the health crisis.\nIndonesia is a major partner for France in Southeast Asia. Our countries are united by bonds of friendship and since 2011, by a strategic partnership based on common values \u200b\u200bsuch as democracy, human rights, tolerance and pluralism within society, and the conception of a secure, law-based international order that we are engaging to strengthen today.\nFacing the growing challenges of globalization, peace and security, be it climate change, the fight against terrorism, radicalism and extremism, disarmament, non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction or health, our two countries recognize the leading role played by the United Nations and other multilateral international organizations.\nIn the Indo-Pacific region, France and Indonesia promote the same vision of an inclusive and open space, in which France intends to contribute to regional stability and growth by strengthening its partnerships in three sectors: maritime cooperation, connectivity and sustainable development (Sustainable Development Goals), fully in line with the priorities of Indonesia and ASEAN, a central player in regional architecture.\nUnpredictable, deadly and long-lasting, the COVID-19 crisis makes us realize that to face a pandemic, only a collective response is effective. There is a need to strengthen multilateralism and international cooperation, France and Indonesia are fully committing in order to better prevent and overcome future crises.\nIt is an ambitious and demanding project that must be driven by common values. In this regard, the spirit of July 14, which we celebrate in France, can be instilled in this momentum.

Tai-chi practitioners, tea ceremony masters, experts in aromatic culture, flower arrangement artists and players of\nguqin\n\u2014 a Chinese musical instrument \u2014 are China\u2019s latest cultural ambassadors to Southeast Asia.\nThe tour was the brainchild of the Philippines mission to ASEAN, which conceived of a platform to increase Chinese-ASEAN cultural exchanges during a 2018 visit to Beijing by the Committee of Permanent Representatives to ASEAN.\n\u201cI hope that this tour of Chinese folk culture will serve as a window for ASEAN to understand Chinese history, culture and art. We are looking forward to more cooperation between ASEAN and China in this field,\u201d said Noel Servigon, the permanent representative of the Philippines to ASEAN, in a speech during the official launch of the tour on Monday at the ASEAN Secretariat in Jakarta.\nSince 2012, Chinese President Xi Jinping has advocated for greater cultural exchanges between countries as part of his platform of \u201ca community of common destiny\u201d. Beijing\u2019s acts of cultural diplomacy in Southeast Asia can be understood as one such attempt at people-to-people exchanges.\nChina\u2019s cultural ambassadors are not new to the ASEAN region. Over the course of the 2014 China-ASEAN Cultural Year, Chinese fan dancers and folk musicians filled the theater at Balai Kartini in Jakarta in an effort by the Chinese government to exhibit China\u2019s cultural achievements in Southeast Asia. Confucius institutes in Indonesia and worldwide act as vessels for the dissemination of Chinese culture and education.\n\u201cChina finds it easy to place a wedge in Southeast Asia by showing that only China can connect with Southeast Asia culturally, not countries like the United States and Western Europe,\u201d said Xue Gong, a research fellow in China-ASEAN relations at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore.\nChina\u2019s Ambassador to ASEAN, Huang Xilian, emphasized the cultural similarities between Southeast Asian countries and China, in an interview with The Jakarta Post on Monday. \u201cChina and ASEAN countries both belong to Asian civilizations or Eastern civilizations or Oriental civilizations with a very rich culture,\u201d said Huang.\nEarlier this year, Huang admitted to a lack of understanding between China and ASEAN countries after a survey of Southeast Asians conducted by the Singapore-based ASEAN Studies Center revealed that 51.5 percent of respondents felt distrust toward China\u2019s influence in the region. The majority said they believed China intends to be a revisionist power and turn Southeast Asia into its sphere of influence.\n\u201cIncreasing trust between China and ASEAN countries is a process we need to promote from time to time,\u201d Huang said on Monday, \u201cIn order to do this, we need to conduct changes from various perspectives and folk culture is one important perspective to contribute to this process since folk culture is something that ordinary people are fond of.\u201d\nWhile China\u2019s economic, political and strategic influence in Southeast Asia is high, the survey concluded that Chinese soft power penetration in mainland Southeast Asia remains low, with a very small minority of respondents desiring to travel to or study in China.\n\u201cDue to the trust deficit in the region and prevalent Chinese threat perceptions, China realizes it still needs to invest in other areas than just infrastructure projects and cultural or people-to-people exchanges are a very important pillar of its Belt and Road Initiative,\u201d said Gong.\nThe logo for the ASEAN-China Young Leaders Scholarship was also unveiled at the launch of the tour on Monday, marking a step toward increased educational partnerships between China and Southeast Asia. The scholarship would provide funding for Southeast Asian nationals to pursue graduate education, research and training in China.\nHowever, Gong expressed doubt about the extent to which China\u2019s soft power overtures would be effective in changing Southeast Asian perceptions of China as a threat in the region.\n\u201cIn international relations theory, how useful and effective soft power can be is very difficult to determine. Realists only believe military power and, to a large extent, economic power are effective,\u201d said Gong. \u201cI don\u2019t think soft power will surpass China\u2019s emphasis on economic statecraft. It is only playing a complementary role in terms of reducing the concerns of Southeast Asian countries.\u201d\nPresident Xi first proposed the Belt and Road Initiative during a 2013 visit to Indonesia.\n&nbsp;\n\u2014\nThe writer is an intern at\nThe Jakarta Post.\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Article\nNavigating Indonesia-US relations amid global and domestic changes\nMegawati supports free meals program, with caveat\nJapan seeks Indonesia\u2019s help to solve labor crisis\nRussia teams up with BRICS to create AI alliance\nIndonesia must regain credibility as an honest broker\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nMore in News\nView more\nOpinion\nAnalysis: Govt adopts mandatory B35 biodiesel program as CPO prices tumble\nBusiness\nGlobal chip crunch stunts Indonesia car sales recovery\nBusiness\nXL profit falls in Q3 as tower sale income dries\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo\u2019s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?\nAcademia\nStop with the LGBTQ scapegoating\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nAcademia\nNavigating Indonesia-US relations amid global and domestic changes",

MH Thamrin in Central Jakarta. The parade displayed national and traditional cultures from ASEAN member countries. (JP/Ibrahim Irsyad)\nT\nhe culture and history of Southeast Asia is influenced by India, and also China to a large extent, as a dominant power in the past. India is poised today to regain its former glory, driven by its Act East policy. The policy, first announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi during the 2014 ASEAN Summit, is an upgraded iteration of the Look East policy of 1992, announced by then prime minister Narasimha Rao. India is now aiming for better engagements with countries to its east, including those of ASEAN, not only in the realm of economics, but also politics and security.\nLeaders from India and all 10 ASEAN members states are gathering in New Delhi today (Jan. 25) for the 25th ASEAN-India Commemorative Summit, with big hopes that they will convert cultural ties of over a millennia into tangible mutual benefits. With a population of some 1.2 billion, India is definitely a promising market for ASEAN entrepreneurs and businesses. It will also certainly be challenging.\nIndia still needs to improve not only its infrastructure, which in itself provides investment opportunities, but also its bureaucracy to be more efficient in processing the necessary licenses and permits for foreign investors to operate in the subcontinent.\nMeanwhile, ASEAN members are also expecting more Indian companies to enter their markets and flourish together. The ASEAN-India alliance is targeting US$200 billion in bilateral trade by 2020. With the rise of protectionism, however, much work needs to be done to ensure stakeholders that foreign investment is not all bad. Governments need to balance their national interests with the need to open their markets toward economic growth.\nIndia is maintaining a benign stance with respect to other countries\u2019 sovereignty and their respective needs. A similar approach is also taken in the political and security spheres with respect to rule of law, and by adopting peaceful means to resolve problems such as border disputes.\nState leaders are also expected to raise various security issues at the Summit, ranging from counterterrorism to maritime security. India stresses that ASEAN countries are its immediate neighbors, and therefore closer cooperation is only natural, especially in maritime security.\nLike Indonesia\u2019s recent doctrine of \u201cglobal maritime fulcrum,\u201d India has its own maritime policy called the sagarmala, or \u201cocean garland,\u201d which focuses on improving access to ports. With its catchphrase of \u201cport-led prosperity,\u201d the Indian policy joins port operators with railway networks for better connectivity in transporting goods and passengers.\nIndia has also affirmed its recognition of ASEAN\u2019s unity and centrality in maintaining security and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region. ASEAN countries must, however, come to terms and unite under the ASEAN flag to achieve its vision of \u201cOne ASEAN, One Community.\u201d Once ASEAN members unite, there is nothing to stop them from reaching shared prosperity with India, as exemplified by the Summit\u2019s theme of \u201cShared values, Common Destiny\u201d.\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Article\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nBRICS welcomes Indonesia: A view from New Delhi\nFadli Zon promises to continue repatriating cultural artifacts\nBret Easton Ellis: 'I was always suspicious of wealth'\nNew exhibition navigates memories to celebrate Indonesia\u2019s geographic diversity\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nMore in Academia\nView more\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo\u2019s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nAcademia\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?\nAcademia\nStop with the LGBTQ scapegoating\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities",

(-/-)\nI\nndonesia has had a long history of positive and fruitful relations with the South Pacific region and its 14 countries and 10 million inhabitants.\nThe overall relationship between the two sides has shown a slow but steady increase in economic cooperation over the years.\nIn 2013 alone, Indonesia donated millions of US dollars to Pacific countries to be used in various fields. In early 2016, Foreign Minister Retno LP Marsudi visited Pacific countries to reiterate Indonesia\u2019s interest in strengthening relations with them.\nThe Foreign Ministry has expressed its belief that this relationship has the potential for further development.\n\u201cBecoming part of the Pacific is destiny. You can choose your friends but not your neighbors,\u201d said Desra Percaya, who is director general for Asia-Pacific and African Affairs of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Indonesia.\n\u201cIndonesia\u2019s diplomatic mission in the Pacific is to create a territory that is safe, stable and friendly, and to increase economic cooperation, trade, investment and social-cultural relations.\u201d\nThe country has developed diplomatic relations with nearly all countries in the Pacific, and is currently in the process of opening a relationship with the Cook Islands.\nIts relations with Pacific nations encompasses aspects like capacity building, diplomatic training, inter-university partnerships (such as between Pasundan University and Fiji National University) and work on dealing with common concerns, such as climate change.\nWith the Fiji archipelago, for instance, Indonesia has maintained a strong and dynamic relationship for the past 30 years. It has helped Fiji respond to disaster. In the aftermath of the recent category-five tropical storm, Cyclone Winston, which devastated Fiji last February, the Indonesian government has given the Fiji island nation US$5 million in reconstructive and rehabilitative aid.\nThe government has also pledged to help Fiji rebuild its Queen Victoria School by deploying engineer troops. It has also offered cooperation in areas of fisheries, food security and general disaster mitigation. In helping Fiji develop its agriculture sector, Indonesia has also sent 100 hand tractor units to aid the Fiji government.\nAnother Pacific nation, Papua New Guinea, has also enjoyed positive relations with Indonesia. In April this year, Rimbink Pato, Papua New Guinea\u2019s foreign affairs and immigration minister, said that both countries had signed 11 memorandums of understanding and three corporate arrangements that spanned issues such as economic cooperation and politics.\nThe ministers of both countries have also discussed security arrangements, intelligence sharing and working in close cooperation on the border.\nThroughout the years, Indonesia\u2019s work with its neighbors in the Pacific region has also resulted in a number of influential intergovernmental sub-regional organizations, such as the Pacific Islands Forum (PIF), the Melanesian Spearhead Group (MSG), the Southwest Pacific Dialogue (SWPD), the Coral Triangle Initiative on Coral Reefs, Fisheries and Food Security (CTI-CFF) and the Pacific Islands Development Forum (PIDF).\nAmong the most notable of the organizations is the MSG, which began in 1988 as a means to promote economic cooperation among Melanesian nations \u2013 Fiji, Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu. Indonesia was recognized as an associate member in 2015, after initially being accepted as an observer in 2011.\nThe relationship between Indonesia and the MSG countries is not simply economic. Indonesia in the past has used its common cultural background with these Melanesian countries to strengthen bilateral relations.\nIndonesia has 11 million people of Melanesian descent spread across provinces such as Maluku and East Nusa Tenggara.\nIn fact, according to Vice Minister of Foreign Affair A. M Fachir, increased connectivity between Melanesians in Indonesia and the MSG nations could pave the way for broader access to the Indonesian market.\n\u201cStronger connectivity will create wider opportunities,\u201d Desra added.\n\u201cTo answer this challenge, Indonesia is pushing for a meeting of the SWPD Group on Connectivity under the leadership of Papua New Guinea to discuss strengthening connectivity between Indonesia and the Pacific, especially the Southwest Pacific.\u201d\nIn 2014, Indonesia and the MSG nations also agreed on a nine-paragraph joint statement that identified potential venues for cooperation in fields such as food security, education, democracy, good governance and social and cultural issues.\nThe country\u2019s desire to improve cooperation extends to the natural world as well. In 2009, during the World Ocean Conference, Indonesia spearheaded the CTI-CFF with countries like Malaysia, the Philippines and Papua New Guinea.\nAside from protecting nature, Indonesia has also used the CTI-CFF as a way of fighting against illegal, unregulated and unreported fishing, and to have it classified as a Transnational Organized Crime.\nThis decades-long history of cooperation between Indonesia and the Pacific nations has all been part of Indonesia\u2019s diplomacy goal of building good relations with all of its neighbors and maintaining a stable, prosperous and secure regional neighborhood, which in turn is crucial for Indonesia\u2019s own security, development and prosperity.\n\u201cIndonesia has an interest in pushing for stronger political stability and economic growth in the Pacific by playing its role in building bridges to Southeast Asia,\u201d Desra said.\n&nbsp;\nMINISTRY OF COMMUNICATION AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Article\nNavigating Indonesia-US relations amid global and domestic changes\nMegawati supports free meals program, with caveat\nJapan seeks Indonesia\u2019s help to solve labor crisis\nRussia teams up with BRICS to create AI alliance\nIndonesia must regain credibility as an honest broker\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nMore in Front Row\nView more\nFront Row\nThink Business, Think Hong Kong: Spotlighting Asia opportunities in Jakarta\nFront Row\nBPJS Kesehatan partners with stakeholders to build a fraud-free JKN ecosystem\nFront Row\nFore Coffee ends the year strong with hopeful prospects and locally focused products\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo\u2019s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nAcademia\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?\nAcademia\nStop with the LGBTQ scapegoating\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities",

Sheng Guangzu, right,  Chinese State Councillor Wang Yong, second right, and Chinese Ambassador to Indonesia Xie Feng, third right, during the groundbreaking ceremony for the construction of its railway in Cikalong Wetan, West  Java, Indonesia, Thursday, Jan. 21, 2016.  (AP Photo/Dita Alangkara)\nI\nn light of the recent increase in Chinese presence in Natuna waters, critics and scholars alike have called on the Indonesian government to break its silence and assert its own legally-backed claims over Indonesia\u2019s exclusive economic zone (EEZ).\nWhile China considers the Natuna Islands to be part of its \u201ctraditional fishing grounds\u201d, Indonesia holds legal sovereignty based on the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). However, neither side&nbsp;have&nbsp;stated specific territorial claims, leading some to wonder what imperatives have kept Indonesia from taking a firmer stance on the issue.\nThis event marks Indonesia\u2019s entry into the South China Sea debate, almost a decade after the territorial fiasco between China, Vietnam, Malaysia, and the Philippines began. And just as the country remained silent on the Spratly&nbsp;Islands&nbsp;dispute, so too has Indonesia taken a \u201cnon-claimant\u201d stance on the Natuna issue. Researcher Evan Laksmana described Indonesia\u2019s position as akin to a \u201chollow neutrality\u201d --&nbsp;one that China echoes with great ambiguity, and one that has only recently been questioned.\nIndeed, this event comes as a striking change in direction for China-Indonesia relations, largely due to how Indonesia remained (much to China\u2019s favor) \u201cneutral\u201d during the SCS debacle, in addition to the&nbsp;recent&nbsp;groundbreaking of a China-financed Indonesian high-speed rail (HSR) project. It thus seems curiously contradictory that China acts as both a benevolent neighbor and a regional superpower - assisting Indonesia\u2019s development while simultaneously threatening its territorial sovereignty.\nThis analysis proposes that China\u2019s economic assertiveness and Indonesia\u2019s supposed neutrality regarding the SCS are somewhat interlinked, and that future Indonesian policy should be viewed under this consideration.\n&nbsp;\nChinese economic investment in Indonesia\nChina\u2019s \u201cOne Belt One Road\u201d initiative positioned Indonesia as the largest Southeast Asian recipient of China\u2019s foreign infrastructure investment, amounting to about $87 billion in repayable loans. Rather controversially beating Japan, China recently won the contract to build Indonesia\u2019s first HSR project between Jakarta and Bandung, investing $5.5 billion without requiring a guarantee from the Indonesian government.\nAccording to Xie Feng, the Chinese ambassador to Indonesia, the HSR project represents a \u201cmajor breakthrough in international capacity and equipment cooperation\u201d between the two nations - a landmark agreement representing the win-win nature of China\u2019s ambitious \u201cOne Belt One Road\u201d initiative.\nBut for China, investing in foreign infrastructure projects is not so much a politicized tactic as it is an economic necessity. The nation\u2019s railway industry has reached a critical economic juncture: China\u2019s own railway networks are already highly developed, and its production surpluses create an imperative to expand its customer base to countries like Indonesia. This perhaps explains the strong economic ties China has built with several ASEAN nations.\nThis is not to say that China\u2019s economic assistance is entirely apolitical in nature. Critics claim that China\u2019s recent investments&nbsp;in infrastructure&nbsp;are mere diplomatic attempts to ease tensions between ASEAN member states.\nOthers see it as an attempt to find a line of influence - an opening in the Southeast Asian region. After all, a central hallmark of Chinese foreign policy is reciprocity, and it seems that China will only testify to its \u201cgood neighborhood\u201d approach so long as its territorial claims in the SCS remain uncontested.\nDiplomatically speaking, China emphasizes a \u201ccommon destiny\u201d approach of coercive connectivity that opposes the ASEAN norm of mutual noninterference. China capitalizes on this noninterference by building bilateral relationships with individual ASEAN countries - leaving its expansion policies largely uncontested by ASEAN neighbors.\nAs a result, the \u201cChina Threat\u201d involves the expectation of reciprocation in the political sphere that China demands of its economic recipients. The low level of mutual political trust and fear of Chinese hegemony is in fact secondary to the quiet realization that the \u201chigh speed\u201d diplomacy has unwritten obligations.\n&nbsp;\nThe litmus test: So far so good?\nWilmar Salim and Siwage Negara from the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies, posit that China\u2019s investment in Indonesian infrastructure can be seen as an economic \u201clitmus test\u201d.&nbsp;But the litmus test goes beyond economic viability; the HSR project is also a litmus test for the structural legacy of what Chinese infrastructural investments leave behind.\nIn particular, the proposition of building a \u201ccommon destiny\u201d leaves neither intellectual expertise nor local manufacturing facilities, reflecting what Hong Yu of the USC US-China Institute describes as China\u2019s competitive, rather than complementary, relationship with its ASEAN counterparts.\nThe politicized premise behind China\u2019s foreign economic investments is thus not as altruistic as it seems, and the inherent danger is in assessing the \u201cwin-win\u201d results of the \u201cOne Belt One Road\u201d initiative solely by its economic outcomes.\nThe fallacy is in using the HSR project itself as a litmus test - and thereby a source of justification - to assess the political soundness of China\u2019s influence on Indonesia. After all, wouldn\u2019t such a fallacy likewise justify and encourage Indonesia to maintain its indifference toward the SCS debate?\nThe question of Indonesia\u2019s silence lies beyond China exerting its political prowess under the guise of economic benevolence. Instead, Indonesia should be more concerned with its supposed neutrality regarding the China-Indonesia HSR project, as well as the illusory perception that the HSR project is mutually exclusive from the SCS fiasco.\nThis is not to say that Indonesia should be wholly condemned for its silence; the debate on territorial sovereignty remains integral, but the antithesis to that indifference is far from the solution. In order for Indonesia to find its compromise, critics must first acknowledge the reasons behind the government\u2019s current silence.\nMuch like how the Jakarta\u2019s High Speed Rail project is far from being politically neutral, so too is Indonesia\u2019s supposedly \u201cneutral\u201d response tainted with color.\n&nbsp;\n***\nJulius Utama is a student in New York University's Department of Applied Psychology, with research concentrations in Sociology and Communications.

In just a few months, Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) leaders will again meet in Indonesia, Southeast Asia\u2019s largest economy. How far has the region come in achieving those goals and what more needs to be done?\n&nbsp;The headline achievements are impressive. To note just one, incomes in the region have more than doubled since 1994 from an average of US$10,000 to more than $23,000.\nThe journey to where we are today has not been easy. The region has been buffeted by economic crises, first in 1997-1998 and then in 2008-2009. This crisis is not yet over, a number of APEC members recently enacted stimulus measures to kick start growth, such as QE3 in the US and Japan\u2019s new attempt to reflate its economy. There is a possibility of a new stimulus in China in response to a deteriorating external environment.\nThese measures, while focused on domestic growth, have some unintended consequences. We are seeing rising capital flows into Asia that pose challenges, including the need to minimize the risks of asset bubbles and excessive credit expansion. There is already talk of \u201ccurrency wars\u201d and competitive devaluations. While the rhetoric makes for exciting reading, the world is far too complex for simplistic reasoning.\nAt the outset of the crisis, many had feared a descent into beggar-thy-neighbor polices, but thus far, through the actions of the G20 and APEC, we have avoided this. At this critical juncture, when nationalist sentiments are rising, we need more cooperation and understanding. APEC is the embodiment of bridging differences and must continue to play its role in bringing a diverse community together.\nWhile APEC has done well in terms of freeing up trade and investment, the world that it occupies has changed. In 1994, bilateral trade deals were the exception, today they are the rule.\nEven this is changing. The ASEAN Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership Framework will consolidate the ASEAN+1 agreements into a single area and the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement hopes to build on the Pacific 4 agreement. Outside our region, the US and the EU are talking about a trans-Atlantic trade agreement, which would create the single biggest market in the world.\nThese massive trade groups, while potentially building blocs to multilateralism, can make outsiders feel excluded. This is a dangerous path to go down and this region, through APEC, with its spirit of inclusiveness and openness, should ensure that no economy is left out.\nHowever, strong headline growth has masked a dirty secret \u2014 income disparities have been growing both among and within regional economies. APEC leaders have long talked of the need for growth to be equitable \u2014 both in Bogor and in recent years such as in 2009 in Singapore \u2014 with a call to \u201cfoster inclusive growth\u201d and in Yokohama where it was a key dimension of the APEC Growth Strategy.\nThe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) set the objective of universal primary education by 2015. In this region, we should move ahead and aim to provide all our citizens with the skills to participate in this competitive global economy. While some economies have done particularly well in increasing tertiary education participation, for example in South Korea where the ratio has increased from 35 percent to almost universal enrollment since 1994, others lag behind.\nHowever, enrollment rates are not a panacea. One need only look at high unemployment rates among recent graduates in parts of Europe to see this. Emphasis must be on flexibility and resilience. There is a need for educational institutions and businesses to work together to help to develop skills of our peoples to fulfill their potential. This requires a change in culture in both business and education providers.\nEven if our people possess the skills to compete, they cannot do so if they are not connected to the market. We need our people and our businesses \u2014 large and small \u2014 to be able to connect to where opportunities exist. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) estimates that East Asia alone needs to invest some $8 trillion in infrastructure.\nMuch of this would be in transportation but a critical part of the creative economy is access to information. Access to the Internet varies tremendously in the region, from 2 to 84 in every 100 in Papua New Guinea and South Korea, respectively.\nAnother aspect of the integration process is how do our businesses reap the opportunities that lie ahead? It has been conventional wisdom that multinational corporations account for 70 percent of global trade, while at the same time small and medium enterprises (SMEs) account for 90 percent of all businesses.\nThe idea that products are made in one particular country has given way to the idea of being \u201cmade in the world\u201d. The emergence of global value chains opens up opportunities for SMEs to participate, but SMEs face a distinct set of problems going global as trade rules and compliance costs disproportionately impact smaller businesses, and their access to finance and information about overseas markets is limited.\nA focus on these three areas: education, infrastructure and barriers to SME participation, could help make a major difference to addressing APEC\u2019s goals of equitable and inclusive growth in the years ahead. Calls for addressing inequality should not be misconstrued as calls for the redistribution of wealth \u2014 that has already been tried and failed. Making growth equitable and inclusive are essential to the region\u2019s goal of community building \u2014 that is one in which we share a sense of common destiny and purpose.\nThese issues will be addressed during a conference organized by the Pacific Economic Cooperation Council (PECC), the Singapore National Committee for Pacific Economic Cooperation (SINCPEC) and the Indonesian National Committee for Pacific Economic Cooperation (INCPEC) on Feb. 22-23.\n\u2014 Jusuf Wanandi is the co-chair of the Pacific Economic Cooperation Council and vice-chair of the Board of Trustees of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) in Jakarta.\n\u2014 Tan Khee Giap is the chair of the SINCPEC and co-director of the Asian Competitiveness Institute (Singapore) at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy, NUS.\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Articles\nNavigating Indonesia-US relations amid global and domestic changes\nMegawati supports free meals program, with caveat\nJapan seeks Indonesia\u2019s help to solve labor crisis\nRussia teams up with BRICS to create AI alliance\nIndonesia must regain credibility as an honest broker\nRelated Article\nNavigating Indonesia-US relations amid global and domestic changes\nMegawati supports free meals program, with caveat\nJapan seeks Indonesia\u2019s help to solve labor crisis\nRussia teams up with BRICS to create AI alliance\nIndonesia must regain credibility as an honest broker\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nMore in News\nView more\nOpinion\nAnalysis: Govt adopts mandatory B35 biodiesel program as CPO prices tumble\nBusiness\nGlobal chip crunch stunts Indonesia car sales recovery\nBusiness\nXL profit falls in Q3 as tower sale income dries\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo\u2019s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nAcademia\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?\nAcademia\nStop with the LGBTQ scapegoating\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities",

AZEC supports Indonesia in transitioning toward a low-carbon, sustainable economy and contributing to the broader regional decarbonization goals.\nIn Vientiane, leaders welcomed the outcome of the Second AZEC Ministerial Meeting, which was held in Jakarta on Aug. 21, including the joint statement that emphasized the importance of achieving a \"triple breakthrough\", addressing climate change, promoting inclusive economic growth and ensuring energy security simultaneously.\nTo this end, leaders committed to aligning their decarbonization efforts with sustainable economic development and accelerating project delivery for the energy transition.\nPartners launched an action plan for the next decade to operationalize the platform and implement strategic initiatives. An overarching priority is diversifying the energy mix, acknowledging energy efficiency as the \"first fuel\" toward achieving net-zero emissions, and promoting the deployment of renewable energy technologies, including next-generation options such as perovskite solar cells and advanced geothermal.\nProspects\nEvery Monday\nWith exclusive interviews and in-depth coverage of the region's most pressing business issues, \"Prospects\" is the go-to source for staying ahead of the curve in Indonesia's rapidly evolving business landscape.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nThe leaders highlighted the essential role of natural gas and liquefied natural gas (LNG) as transition fuels to achieve climate goals. They agreed to cooperate on the safe and peaceful use of nuclear energy, reinforcing Coordinating Minister Airlangga\u2019s ongoing efforts to mobilize investment for small nuclear reactors to support Indonesia\u2019s green industrialization.\nAZEC partners are focused on building robust power systems, maximizing renewable energy and ensuring grid reinforcement and flexibility, which is vital for catalyzing cross-border electricity trading within the ASEAN Power Grid. Partners promote zero-emission thermal power generation through hydrogen, ammonia, bioenergy as well as carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS).\nRapid progress in a&nbsp;cross-border energy trading system that is mutually beneficial could provide a significant windfall for Indonesia, a competitive clean tech player and a global energy producer.\nDecarbonizing the transportation sector through electrification, infrastructure development and the enhanced use of sustainable fuels, including sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and e-fuels, is a further strategic thrust for AZEC. Indonesia is directly benefiting from pilot projects, including developing coconut oil into aircraft fuel, peatland management projects in Central Kalimantan and the construction of the Java-Sumatra electricity network.\nCoordinating Minister Airlangga highlighted that \u201cthe AZEC Framework delivers quick wins for Indonesia\u2019s energy transition\u201d. Partners helped to resolve several obstacles to the construction of the Muara Laboh Phase 2 Geothermal Power Plant and the Legok Nangka Waste Power Plant, which were announced at the first AZEC Summit in December 2023. Indonesia also prepared the commencement of Kayan, which is the largest hydropower project in ASEAN.\nIn Vientiane, leaders promoted achieving carbon neutrality or net-zero emissions in industrial parks through renewable energy, energy efficiency, hydrogen and its derivatives, and CCUS. Enhancing industries' competitiveness through measuring GHG emissions throughout the supply chains is critical, particularly for Indonesia\u2019s green industrialization and the need for job-creating, low-emissions new growth industries.\nLeaders also launched the Asia Zero Emission Center, which the Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia will host. The center will help partner countries develop visions, road maps, or policies toward decarbonization. Australia also announced its support for the center and reaffirmed the A$2 billion Southeast Asia Investment Financing Facility announced at the 2024 ASEAN-Australia Special Summit to further strengthen regional cooperation.\nJust and affordable financing for the energy transition is a crucial AZEC priority, as is collaboration between the public and private sectors for innovative financing, such as blended finance. Promoting transition finance to draw in private-sector investment and enhance project bankability is a critical challenge for implementing Indonesia\u2019s ambitious energy transition project pipeline.\nFurthermore, a strategic priority for the region is establishing high-integrity carbon markets, including expanding carbon credit markets. Leaders\u2019 noted discussions were&nbsp;held recently at the second AZEC International Conference to Promote the Joint Crediting Mechanism (JCM) and Develop Carbon Markets earlier in August.\nThis is a promising development for Indonesia, which is currently refining its carbon market regulations, strengthening its monitoring and verification procedures and engaging with international partners. Indonesia\u2019s carbon trading ecosystem is expected to come online soon to be robust and attractive to domestic and global investors.\nPartners welcomed the ASEAN-Japan MIDORI Cooperation Plan, which aims to enhance productivity emission reductions and carbon removals in agriculture and forestry through technology and innovation. This sector is another vital priority for Indonesia\u2019s nationally determined contributions under the Paris Agreement. Indonesia will join partners in efforts to establish and tailor technologies&nbsp;and facilitate the calculation and reporting practices for greenhouse gas emissions in agriculture and forestry.\nThe Second AZEC Leaders' Meeting has set the stage for a collaborative and ambitious path toward a sustainable future in the Indo-Pacific region. By aligning their efforts, the AZEC partner countries are poised to lead the way in addressing the global climate challenge while fostering inclusive economic growth and energy security.\nThis article was published in collaboration with Coordinating Ministry for&nbsp; Economic Affairs Republic of Indonesia\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Article\nPLN partners with US, Japan to build nuclear power plants\nPLN doubles down on renewables with 47 GW target over 10 years\nEnergy self-sufficiency: Opportunities and challenges for the new government\nAnalysis: Political appointees helm Pertamina amid grandiose energy ambitions\nGDP growth drops below 5% as consumer spending loses steam\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nMore in Business\nView more\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nTech\nMinister says Apple 'losing out' by dragging its feet on $1b investment\nRegulations\nMinistry inks collab with army, police on food security\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo\u2019s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nAcademia\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?\nAcademia\nStop with the LGBTQ scapegoating\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities",

(Reuters/EVELYN HOCKSTEIN)\nT\nhe Group of 20 adopted a consensus declaration at a summit on Saturday that avoided condemning Russia for the war in Ukraine but called on all states not to use force to grab territory.\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that the Leaders' Declaration had been adopted on the first day of the weekend G20 summit in New Delhi.\n\"On the back of the hard work of all the teams, we have received consensus on the G20 Leaders Summit Declaration. I announce the adoption of this declaration,\" Modi told the leaders, including US&nbsp;President Joe Biden and heads of government and state from across the world.\nThe consensus came as a surprise as G20 is deeply divided over the war in Ukraine, with Western nations earlier pushing for strong condemnation of Russia in the Leaders' Declaration, while others demanded a focus on broader economic issues.\n\"We call on all states to uphold the principles of international law including territorial integrity and sovereignty, international humanitarian law, and the multilateral system that safeguards peace and stability,\" the declaration said.\n\"We ... welcome all relevant and constructive initiatives that support a comprehensive, just, and durable peace in Ukraine.\n\"The use or threat of use of nuclear weapons is inadmissible,\" the statement added.\nUkraine's foreign ministry said the declaration was \"nothing to be proud of\", adding that a Ukrainian presence would have given participants a better understanding of the situation.\nHowever, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said the declaration demonstrated a clear position on Russia's invasion of Ukraine by saying that the territorial integrity of countries cannot be called into question with violence.\nBritish Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said the declaration had \"very strong language about Russia's illegal war in Ukraine\".\n\"I think that is a good and strong outcome.\"\nThere was no immediate reaction from Russia, which is being represented by Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov. He had said he would block the final declaration unless it reflected Moscow's position on Ukraine and other crises.\nRussia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine has left tens of thousands of dead, displaced millions and sown economic turmoil across the world. Moscow denies committing atrocities during the conflict, which it terms a \"special operation\" to \"demilitarize\" Ukraine.\nThe declaration also called for the implementation of the Black Sea initiative for the safe flow of grain, food and fertilizer from Ukraine and Russia. Moscow pulled out of the agreement in July over what it called a failure to meet its demands to implement a parallel agreement easing rules for its own food and fertilizer exports.\nChina supports, India says\nIndia's Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar said China, Russia's main major ally, was supportive of the outcome.\n\"Differing viewpoints and interests were at play, but we were able to find common ground on all issues,\" he told a press conference.\nThe differing views on the war had prevented agreement on even a single communique at ministerial meetings during India's G20 presidency so far this year.\nIndia's sherpa, the country representative to the G20, said the host nation worked \"very closely\" with Brazil, South Africa and Indonesia to reach a consensus on the language on the war in Ukraine in the summit document.\nThe declaration also said the group agreed to address debt vulnerabilities in low and middle-income countries \"in an effective, comprehensive and systematic manner\", but did not make any fresh action plan.\nIt said countries pledged to strengthen and reform multilateral development banks, while it accepted the proposal for tighter regulation of cryptocurrencies.\nIt also agreed that the world needs a total of $4 trillion of low-cost financing annually for the energy transition, with a high share of renewables in the primary energy mix.\nThe statement called for accelerating efforts towards a \"phasedown of unabated coal power\", but said this had to be done \"in line with national circumstances and recognizing the need for support towards just transitions\".\nDelhi closed down for summit\nAt the start of the day, Biden and other leaders were driven through deserted streets to a new, $300 million conch-shaped convention center&nbsp;called Bharat Mandapam, opposite a 16th-century stone fort.\nMany businesses, offices and schools have been closed in the city and traffic restricted as part of security measures to ensure the smooth running of the most high-powered meeting to be hosted by the country.\nModi inaugurated the meeting by calling on members to end a \"global trust deficit\" and announced that the bloc was granting permanent membership to the African Union in an effort to make it more representative.\nDespite the compromise over the Leaders' Declaration, the summit had been expected to be dominated by the West and its allies. Chinese President Xi Jinping is skipping the meeting and has sent Premier Li Qiang instead, while Russia's Vladimir Putin was also absent.\nBiden, Scholz, Sunak, French President Emmanuel Macron, Saudi Arabia's Mohammed Bin Salman and Japan's Fumio Kishida, among others, are attending.\n\"It's incumbent upon the Chinese government to explain\" why its leader would or would not participate, Jon Finer, the U.S. deputy national security adviser, told reporters in Delhi.\nBiden said on Saturday: \"It would be nice to have him here but the summit is going well.\"\nFiner said there was speculation that China is \"giving up on G20\" in favor of groupings like BRICS, where it is dominant.\nBRICS includes Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, and has agreed to add another six members -- Saudi Arabia, Iran, Ethiopia, Egypt, Argentina and the United Arab Emirates - accelerating its push to reshuffle a world order it sees as outdated.\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Article\nRestoring the habit of dialogue, reinforcing inclusive principles\nThe significance of synchronizing foreign and defense policies\nIndonesia wants to join BRICS, ministry says\nThe APEC Summit: Prabowo\u2019s global debut as president\nIndian capital records highest-ever temperature at 49.9 Celsius\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nMore in World\nView more\nEurope\nUS announces new arms aid package for Ukraine worth $500 million\nMiddle East and Africa\nUS says Israel is acting in Syria for its own defence\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia welcomes UNGA resolution on immediate ceasefire in Gaza\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo\u2019s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nPolitics\nIndonesia to pardon tens of thousands including Papua activists\nAcademia\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?\nAcademia\nStop with the LGBTQ scapegoating",

The ceremony was witnessed by the ASEAN ministers and underscored the importance of collaboration in advancing the region's energy landscape.\nACE's collaborations extend to a diverse range of partners, each of which contributes unique expertise and resources to bolster the energy landscape of ASEAN. To continue the implementation of the ASEAN Plan of Action for Energy Cooperation (APAEC) Phase II: 2021-2025, a total of 12 MoUs have been established.\nThe ASEAN Interconnection Masterplan Study (AIMS) III identified 18 potential cross-border interconnections for energy transmission with a cumulative capacity of 33 gigawatts (GW) by 2040, including two proposed interconnections between Indonesia and Malaysia for feasibility-level analyses: between Sumatra, Indonesia and Peninsular Malaysia, and between Kalimantan and Sabah.\nACE, Indonesia\u2019s state-owned electricity company PLN and Tenaga Nasional Berhad (TNB) are collaborating to develop a feasibility study for an interconnection line between Sumatra, Indonesia and Peninsular Malaysia. The study will focus on scaling up investments in the facility required, supporting the development and implementation of policies and determining the technical, financial and economic feasibility along with the preliminary environmental impact assessment.\nThe Sumatra, Indonesia \u2013 Peninsular Malaysia Interconnection will be the first subsea cross-border interconnection in the region.\nIn addition, ACE, PLN and Sabah Electricity Sdn Bhd (SESB) will collaborate to create a feasibility study with a similar scope, aiming to achieve sustainable energy security interconnectivity in the Brunei Darussalam, Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines (BIMP) area.\nACE is also entering a strategic partnership with the Southeast Asia Energy Transition Partnership (ETP), a multi-stakeholder platform managed by the United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS), and Clean, Affordable and&nbsp; Secure Energy for Southeast Asia (CASE), a project jointly implemented by a consortium of eight entities led by the Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH to implement the ASEAN Power Grid Advancement Programme (APG-AP) in accelerating the renewable energy integration through the ASEAN Power Grid.\nAn MoU between ACE and ACCECC Affairs Managing Agency (AMA) aims to enhance clean energy collaboration between ASEAN and China. ACCECC will scale up the joint research, knowledge sharing and cooperative initiatives in the energy sector that was established in 2017 through cooperation between ACE and the China Renewable Energy Engineering Institute (CREEI). ACCECC will also host programs that showcase solid synergy in policies, technology advancement, financing and human resources capacity building.\nACE is closely collaborating with the Korean Development Bank (KDB) on \"Supporting Innovative Mechanisms for Industrial Energy Efficiency Financing in Indonesia with Lessons for Replication in the other ASEAN Member States\u201d and is continuing its partnership with the Energy Foundation China (EFC) to accelerate the energy transition and ensure energy security in the ASEAN region through joint research, policy development and technology adoption.\nContinuing the collaboration for the region is an MoU with Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA)\n,\nwhere ACE and JICA will work together to expedite decarbonization and promote sustainable development within ASEAN.\nMeanwhile, an MoU with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) will see the two collaborate on developing clean energy and energy efficiency projects, a regional power market and multilateral power trade arrangements and regional power interconnections within ASEAN.\nTo support ASEAN\u2019s energy transition toward net-zero, ACE will further enhance its collaboration with the Japan External Trade Organization (JETRO), while also embarking on a collaborative project with the National Solar Exchange to develop a functional demonstration of a regional energy investment platform.\nLastly, ACE has signed MoUs with three universities; Universiti Tenaga Nasional (UNITEN) to foster academic research and industrial collaboration; Universitas Pendidikan Nasional (UNDIKNAS) to reinforce research and training efforts; and Waseda University to promote research, educational activities and knowledge exchanges.\nThese collaborations underscore ACE's commitment to driving positive change in the energy sector across ASEAN.&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Article\nSerious about nuclear\nWhat the G20 can do for Africa's energy agenda\nIndonesia to attend ASEAN ministers\u2019 meeting on Myanmar\nASEAN ministers to discuss Myanmar at Thailand meeting, Indonesia says\nAnalysis: Prabowo\u2019s energy vision, backed by 1.2 billion euros in green financing\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nMore in Front row\nView more\nFront Row\nThink Business, Think Hong Kong: Spotlighting Asia opportunities in Jakarta\nFront Row\nBPJS Kesehatan partners with stakeholders to build a fraud-free JKN ecosystem\nFront Row\nFore Coffee ends the year strong with hopeful prospects and locally focused products\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo\u2019s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nPolitics\nIndonesia to pardon tens of thousands including Papua activists\nAcademia\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?\nAcademia\nStop with the LGBTQ scapegoating",

(Courtesy of/PT UPC Sidrap Bayu Energi)\nThe Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is a global project China introduced in 2013. It aims to establish an extensive network of connectivity, encompassing both land routes (referred to as economic Silk Roads) and sea routes (known as Silk Sea Routes), connecting China to nations across Asia, Europe, the Middle East and Africa.\nThe economic Silk Road constitutes a land route linking China and Europe through Central Asia, while the Silk Sea route comprises a network of maritime lanes connecting ports in Southeast Asia, South Asia, the Middle East and Africa. The BRI has notable ramifications in the energy sector, including enhancements in energy connectivity, infrastructure and investments in energy resources.\nIn the context of transitioning to renewable energy, the BRI holds the potential to positively influence the countries traversed along these routes, particularly those in Southeast Asia. China has the capability to facilitate technology, industry development and investment in renewable energy.\nThe Southeast Asian nations in particular possess significant untapped potential for renewable energy generation, with the region having the capacity to achieve net-zero emissions and adopt clean energy sources amounting to around 17,000 Gigawatts combined.\nMoreover, countries in\nSoutheast Asia\nhave set targets to reduce emissions by integrating more renewable energy sources into their energy mix. For instance, Malaysia has raised its renewable energy mix target from 20 percent in 2025 to 31 percent in 2025 and 40 percent in 2030, while Indonesia aims for 23 percent by 2025 and 31 percent by 2030. The Philippines has set goals of 30 and 50 percent for energy renewables in their power generation mix by 2030 and\n2040\n, respectively.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nAligned with the growth of renewable energy in Southeast Asia, in September 2021, Chinese President Xi Jinping announced that China would refrain from constructing \"\nnew coal plants abroad\n\".

We are currently finalizing an infrastructure grand design plan for Africa over the next five years,\u201d he said on Tuesday.\nThe government hosted the first Indonesia-Africa Investment Forum in Bali in 2018, giving state and business actors a platform to explore untapped economic opportunities and boost development cooperation.\nBilateral deals\nJokowi appears to be making good on his plan so far.\nMeeting with Kenyan President William Ruto on Monday, Jokowi pushed for a preferential trade agreement (PTA) and a bilateral investment treaty (BIT) between the two countries, while also announcing a fresh pair of initiatives between Jakarta and Nairobi\u2019s energy sector players worth US$2.2 billion in total.\nAlso pushing for health cooperation, Jokowi heralded the alliance between the two countries\u2019 food and drug monitoring agencies and pharmaceutical companies, which expanded cooperation on health products.\nThree memorandums of understanding (MoUs) between the two governments covered these new arrangements, on top of 11 other MoUs signed by both private companies and state-owned enterprises (SOEs).\n\u201cWith the uncertainties of the current global situation, it is time that we solidify the Bandung Spirit and Global South cooperation,\u201d Jokowi said in a statement in Kenya, according to readouts from the presidential press bureau.\n\u201cIt is time for the world to hear the voices and interests of developing countries,\u201d he added.\nIn Tanzania, the President also pushed for a PTA and a BIT, while also announcing new MoUs on energy, mining and health. In support of Tanzania\u2019s infrastructure development, Jokowi said Jakarta was planning to contribute to its agriculture sector by revitalizing the Farmer\u2019s Agriculture and Rural Training Center in Morogoro.\nForeign Minister Retno LP Marsudi, who attended the meeting with Tanzanian President Samia Saluhu on Tuesday, said the African leader expressed an interest in learning more about Indonesia\u2019s infrastructure development and downstreaming industries.\n\u201c[Saluhu] also wanted to learn from Indonesia on how to expand its palm oil industries and [state-owned enterprises] management,\u201d Retno said in a recorded video statement.\nBoth Tanzania and Kenya opened embassies in Jakarta last year.\nOn Tuesday evening, Jokowi arrived in Maputo, the capital of Mozambique, where he was welcomed by Energy and Mineral Resources Minister Joaquim Zacarias and State Secretary Manuel Vicente.\nUnlike Kenya and Tanzania, Mozambique already has a PTA with Indonesia.\nState-owned PT Bank Negara Indonesia (BNI) corporate and international banking director Silvano Rumantir in March said that closer Africa-Indonesia partnerships would be a profitable undertaking, with exports from Jakarta currently valued at $8.2 billion and unrealized trade potential of around $4.6 billion.\nAmong Indonesia\u2019s most competitive exports to Africa were palm oil and its derivatives, rubber, coffee and motorized vehicles. It also imports a significant amount of oil and gas from countries like Nigeria and Angola.\nThe President is likely to spend one day in Maputo before heading off to South Africa to conclude his tour.\nRenewed spirit\nIndonesia\u2019s drive in Africa is informed by its historical bond set out during the Asia-Africa Conference.\nSpearheaded by the first Indonesian president Sukarno, the Bandung conference will celebrate its 70th anniversary in 2025, making Jokowi\u2019s African tour strategically timed to make way for the jubilee, analysts have noted.\nBut while the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union is now of the distant past, and the relevance of the Non-Aligned Movement much questioned, these same experts also noted that today\u2019s geopolitical tensions rooted in the US-China rivalry are reminiscent of that time.\nAgainst this backdrop, Jokowi\u2019s sojourn may be a timely strategy to replicate Sukarno\u2019s vision before he ends his time in office next year.\n\u201cWith the pressure brought on by the two giants, it\u2019s time that Indonesia reignites the NAM and forge friendships with non-aligned countries. The catch here is that China is part of NAM, so Indonesia must tread with care to uphold inclusivity,\u201d Fitriani, an international expert at the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), told\nThe Jakarta Post\non Wednesday.\nDespite the challenges, however, observers believe it is still a worthy undertaking for Indonesia to continue its nonaligned diplomacy considering the current stakes.\n\u201cIndonesia used to be an aid recipient country. Now we are a developing partner for less developed nations. [...] With this new capacity, Indonesia must start thinking about the future of these friendships for the sake of strategic autonomy,\u201d said Lina Alexandra, head of the international relations department at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) in Jakarta.\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Article\nIndonesia must regain credibility as an honest broker\nTrump\u2019s second term could deepen Indonesia-China relations\nPresident Prabowo's new coal phase-out goal sets 'daunting task'\nBetween OECD and BRICS: Indonesia's \u2018bebas-aktif\u2019 conundrum\nIs the G77 the future of multilateralism?\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nMore in Paper\nView more\nOpinion\nAnalysis: Govt adopts mandatory B35 biodiesel program as CPO prices tumble\nBusiness\nGlobal chip crunch stunts Indonesia car sales recovery\nBusiness\nXL profit falls in Q3 as tower sale income dries\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo\u2019s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nPolitics\nIndonesia to pardon tens of thousands including Papua activists\nAcademia\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?\nAcademia\nStop with the LGBTQ scapegoating",

(AFP Photo/Roman Pilipey/Pool)\nI\nn an unprecedented move, in May 2023 former Indonesian Vice President Jusuf Kalla spoke out against the sitting administration's willingness to let China dominate the Indonesian economy. Kalla claimed that the country's debt had bloated to\n&nbsp;\n1,000 trillion rupiah\n&nbsp;or USD$67 billion, although this figure is&nbsp;\nat odds\n&nbsp;with government data.\nChina\u2019s engagement with the Indonesian economy is tied to the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), a 2013 project that was embraced by Indonesian President Joko \"Jokowi\" Widodo. Widodo recognized a natural fit between Indonesia's untapped marine resources and China's enthusiasm to expand its business in the region.\nIndonesia knows that cooperation with China is important, but its engagement with Belt and Road is a measured play to protect its interests and maintain sovereignty.\nChina and Indonesia have strong bilateral ties. After a history of&nbsp;\nstrained\n&nbsp;diplomatic relations, both countries&nbsp;\nre-established\n&nbsp;official ties in 1990. Since then, they have strengthened the relationship, signing a strategic partnership agreement in 2005 and a comprehensive strategic partnership in 2013.\nChina has become Indonesia's largest trading partner and a significant investor in the country, fostering closer economic cooperation and becoming one of Indonesia\u2019s top three foreign investors.\nAs an&nbsp;\nemerging global economic force\n, Indonesia's participation in the BRI aligns with its aspirations for continued development and regional leadership.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nIndonesia's membership in the G20, its involvement in the China-ASEAN free trade scheme and its participation in the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank strengthens its position.\nWith their respective economic strengths, China and Indonesia have valuable assets for increasing cooperation and chasing shared interests through Belt and Road.\nThe Indonesian government's commitment to speeding up infrastructure development lines up well with the goals of the BRI. Indonesia needs investment in many sectors: better transportation networks, more roads, airports, ports and other public facilities that could help improve logistical efficiency.\nThe BRI's emphasis on regional connectivity and economic cooperation aligns with Indonesia's goals and presents opportunities for everyone to win. Leveraging their strong bilateral relations and economic prowess, China and Indonesia can work together to drive sustainable development and prosperity within the framework of Belt and Road.\nWhile Indonesia's economy has grown significantly,&nbsp;\nred tape and bureaucracy\n&nbsp;continue to hinder progress. The government's efforts to reform bureaucracy have had mixed results despite the passing of several economic policy packages aimed at streamlining regulations and law enforcement.\nThe USD$6.2 billion\n&nbsp;\nhigh-speed railway\n&nbsp;project connecting Jakarta to Bandung is an example of the challenges posed by Indonesian bureaucracy. The project commenced in 2015 but land clearance issues and regulatory hurdles have left it suspended. After many adjustments, especially on budget issues, the limited operation of the project is scheduled for August 2023.\nBy prioritizing its maritime strength, Indonesia can align its development goals with Chinese President Xi Jinping's vision of advancing his country's economic interests through the sea.&nbsp;\nBuilding port infrastructure and improving inter-port connectivity would benefit both countries and facilitate trade activities. Widodo\u2019s initiatives \u2014 such the Global Maritime Fulcrum \u2014 align well with China's emphasis on sea-based cooperation, creating collaborative opportunities.&nbsp;\nHowever, China\u2019s BRI comes with risks as well as opportunities. Concerns arise when recipient countries&nbsp;\nstruggle to repay their loans from China,\n&nbsp;leading to a loss of control over the infrastructure projects. Indonesia's increased debt under Widodo's administration highlights the need for caution in managing financial obligations tied to the BRI.\nThe\n&nbsp;\ninflux of Chinese workers\n&nbsp;into Indonesia is another situation worth monitoring. While Chinese labor and technology can contribute to project efficiency, the availability of local job opportunities and potential illegal labor practices create social tensions.&nbsp;\nStricter controls and enforcement mechanisms to ensure compliance with labor laws may help maintain social order.\nIndonesians have&nbsp;\nvaried views\n&nbsp;on China and its ambitious BRI according to a study conducted by the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (\nCSIS\n) in Jakarta. The perception of China among Indonesian bureaucrats and academics has been mostly negative, with concerns about China's economic power and its potential threat to Indonesia's national interests. Suspicion and a lack of trust have shaped perceptions from people who question China's true intentions in Indonesia.\nBut some Indonesians&nbsp;\nsupport\n&nbsp;the initiative, seeing an alignment with Indonesia's own maritime ambitions. Others were pessimistic, fearing that the Belt and Road would further strengthen China's dominance over Indonesia in economic competition. A significant number adopted a cautious \"wait-and-see\" approach toward the initiative.\nThe study also highlighted a lack of awareness among Indonesians regarding China's geopolitical and geo economic influence. A\n&nbsp;\nsurvey\n&nbsp;conducted by the Centre of Chinese Studies found that many Indonesians were familiar with traditional medicine, culture, and communism when asked about their knowledge of China. Respondents lacked awareness of China's economic and military rise.\nThe BRI holds potential for infrastructure development which aligns with Indonesia's national development plan, aimed at promoting the welfare of its people. Some commentators believe Indonesia is the ASEAN country poised to benefit most from the initiative, with over USD$87 billion allocated to\n&nbsp;\ninfrastructure\n&nbsp;projects. The challenge lies in aligning Indonesia's development strategy with Belt and Road to realize mutual interests.\nTo maximize the benefits and address potential challenges, Indonesia must balance its national development goals with the BRI. Environmental conservation considerations should be integrated into infrastructure projects, especially regarding sustainable energy and clean water supply.&nbsp;\nThe BRI has its problems, but Indonesian democracy protects against\n&nbsp;\nadverse consequences\n. As long as Indonesia maintains its democratic checks and balances, it will continue to pursue the right approach to the initiative. Other nations have learned the hard way and Indonesia should not underestimate its own capabilities.\nNur Rachmat Yuliantoro\n&nbsp;is an Associate Professor and the Head of Department of International Relations at Universitas Gadjah Mada in Yogyakarta, Indonesia.

I don\u2019t believe that my country\u2019s interests are served by its AIIB membership,\u201d Pickard said on X, formerly known as Twitter.&nbsp;\nThe Beijing-headquartered lender in July said an internal review had found no evidence that supported Pickard\u2019s allegations.\nLing-Stuckey said he met with China\u2019s ambassador to Papua New Guinea, Zeng Fanhua, and other embassy officials last week to finalize details of a visit to China.\n\u201cI look forward to meetings with China\u2019s Export Credit Bank along with the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank,\u201d he said.&nbsp;\n\u201cChina is our second largest trading partner,\u201d Ling-Stuckey said. \u201cPersonally, three of my grandparents come from China, and it will be good to visit again after a gap of nearly two decades. We are putting in the work to make this visit as productive as possible.\u201d&nbsp;\nBeijing\u2019s influence with economically-lagging Pacific island nations has increased over the past two decades through a combination of trade, infrastructure and aid as it seeks to isolate Taiwan diplomatically, gain allies in international institutions and advance its economic and security interests.\nUS&nbsp;interest in the Pacific was galvanized in early 2022 after Beijing and the Solomon Islands signed a security pact that the US&nbsp;and allies such as Australia fear could lead to a Chinese military presence in a region they consider crucial to their defense and security.\nPresident Joe Biden met Pacific island leaders including Marape last month in Washington, the second US-Pacific islands summit in a year, highlighting the intensifying superpower rivalry in the region.\nMarape, in an Oct. 5 statement, said the Papua New Guinea-Asia Investment Conference in Hong Kong later this month aims to promote investment and trade for Papua New Guinea\u2019s economy and create more jobs.\nPapua New Guinea, home to more than nine million people, is endowed with mineral and natural resources but grapples with challenges such as corruption, lack of roads and basic healthcare in many regions as well as frequent tribal violence.\n\u201cWe will be looking at bringing in investors and businesses that will help realize the government\u2019s strategy to go into downstream processing, grow the economy, and create jobs for our people,\u201d Marape said.&nbsp;\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Article\nNavigating Indonesia-US relations amid global and domestic changes\nBiden pushes new Russia, Iran, Korea, China effort before Trump term\nGovt halts big infrastructure in trade-off for food security: Minister\nMeaningful digital transformation for the Asia-Pacific region\nOvertourism or balanced development?

I do hope that we are also going to have a strong collaboration with many Korean businesses that are interested in participating in this Energy Transition Mechanism country platform that is already being developed,\u201d the finance minister said in her keynote speech on Wednesday.\nSri Mulyani pointed out that global economic challenges exacerbated by geopolitical confrontation called for closer regional cooperation, notably between the ASEAN countries, China, Japan and South Korea.\nBI Governor Perry Warjiyo, speaking in a panel discussion at the forum, elaborated on efforts to create liquidity for the energy transition.\n\u201cIndonesia is one of the largest issuers of green bonds and green\nsukuk\n,\u201d the central bank chief noted, adding: \u201cThe central bank is also issuing monetary instruments that are green.\u201d\nPerry added that BI\u2019s \u201cgreen macroprudential policy\u201d promotes bank financing of green projects, such as by requiring no down payment on loans.\nMeanwhile, IKN Authority head Bambang Susantono used his appearance at the forum to highlight infrastructure investment opportunities for Korean investors to get in on the construction of Indonesia\u2019s future capital city, with a heavy focus on sustainable development: \u201cThis is a huge project with ample opportunities for everybody to participate,\u201d Bambang said, adding that the agency was planning for the city to be carbon-neutral by 2045.\nThe event was the third in a series of business forums organized by the embassy in Seoul and is part of the South Korean RE Invest Indonesia initiative organized jointly with the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) and Tenggara Strategics since 2020.\n&nbsp;\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Article\nBiden pushes new Russia, Iran, Korea, China effort before Trump term\nTrump says anyone investing $1 billion in US will receive expedited permits\nSmartphone investment in Indonesia\nAirlangga: GCPA can potentially support Indonesia\u2019s energy transition\nRegulating imports of digital products sans protectionism\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nMore in Paper\nView more\nOpinion\nAnalysis: Govt adopts mandatory B35 biodiesel program as CPO prices tumble\nBusiness\nGlobal chip crunch stunts Indonesia car sales recovery\nBusiness\nXL profit falls in Q3 as tower sale income dries\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo\u2019s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nPolitics\nIndonesia to pardon tens of thousands including Papua activists\nAcademia\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?\nAcademia\nStop with the LGBTQ scapegoating",

(JP/Deni Ghifari)\nI\nn November, President\nPrabowo Subianto\nvisited China, the United States, Peru, Brazil, the United Kingdom and United Arab Emirates (UAE)&nbsp;to strengthen bilateral and multilateral ties, highlighting Indonesia's growing influence in Asia and the Americas.\nAs 2025 approaches, the global landscape remains multipolar, with rising US-China&nbsp;tensions. Following the Non-Aligned Movement, Indonesia pursues an independent foreign policy prioritizing its national interests. Its strategic position along key maritime trade routes enhances its role in regional stability and global commerce.\nWhile China aims to reduce competitors' influence, Indonesia leverages its relationship with China to negotiate with the US and other advanced economies. However, Indonesia must carefully engage with China to protect its security and sovereignty. President Prabowo has reiterated his commitment to cooperation with China, but this evolving dynamic has overshadowed US diplomatic efforts. For a more effective approach, the US should reassess its policies toward Indonesia and focus on building strong economic partnerships.\nIn recent years, Indonesia has fundamentally redefined its maritime strategy,&nbsp;particularly under former president Joko \u201cJokowi\u201d Widodo\u2019s administration, enhancing its role in the Indo-Pacific with a strategic naval policy. This evolution positions Indonesia as a vital player in regional security and governance.\nAs the US and Indonesia celebrate 75 years of diplomatic ties, their relationship has evolved into a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership (CSP), reinforcing cooperation in addressing global challenges. This partnership is crucial for stability and prosperity, aligning with Indonesia's strategic goals through initiatives like the Indo-Pacific&nbsp;Economic Framework (IPEF). Together, they aim to strengthen maritime security and foster sustainable economic development, paving the way for a resilient future for the region.\nOn Nov. 12, during a formal meeting in Washington, DC, US President Joe Biden and President Prabowo&nbsp;discussed strategic initiatives to build a strong and lasting partnership. They emphasized the critical need to strengthen bilateral defense collaboration to improve regional and global security. A major focus of their discussions was enhancing advanced maritime security capabilities and coordinating operations to combat illegal transnational organized crime.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nThey also placed emphasis on developing integrated intelligence-sharing protocols and creating joint operational frameworks to effectively address emerging security challenges.\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Article\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nFrench troubles won't undermine Europe\u2019s strong foundation\nChina\u2019s fast-changing economic adjustments\nAgainst the tide: Defending human rights and civic freedoms in Southeast Asia\nPentagon chief urges 'close consultation' between Israel and US on Syria\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nMore in Opinion\nView more\nAcademia\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo\u2019s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nAcademia\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?\nAcademia\nStop with the LGBTQ scapegoating\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities",

(Antara/Aji Styawan)\nA\nt a recent annual meeting in Asunci\u00f3n, Paraguay, 63 new practices and traditions were inscribed on UNESCO\u2019s List of Intangible Cultural Heritage (ICH) at the initiative of 90 countries, including the successful inscription of three Indonesian elements: kebaya, kolintang and Reog Ponorogo.\nKebaya\nand\nkolintang\nwere added to the Representative List of ICH, and Reog Ponorogo to the List of ICH in Need of Urgent Safeguarding.\nKebaya\nis a traditional blouse worn by women,\nkolintang\nis a traditional wooden musical instrument of the indigenous Minahasa people of North Sulawesi, and Reog Ponorogo is a performing art from Ponorogo, East Java.\nIt\u2019s worth noting that of the three,\nkebaya\nand\nkolintang\nwere inscribed through a multinational or joint nomination, which applies when a cultural element exists in more than one country.\nKebaya\nis listed as a heritage shared among the five Southeast Asian countries of Brunei Darussalam, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand, while\nkolintang\nis registered as a cultural practice and expression that has links to the balafon in Mali, Burkina Faso and C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire.\nPreviously, the notion of a joint nomination had caused some misunderstandings among the Indonesian public, although it was not the first such case. In 2020,\npantun\n(four-line rhyming poetry) was inscribed as an ICH from both Indonesia and Malaysia. In 2019,\npencak silat\nwas designated jointly as a traditional sport from Indonesia and a combative art of self-defense from Malaysia.\nPrior to the inscription of\nkebaya\n, Indonesian media outlets were full of news about protests against a possible joint nomination. A movement called Kebaya Goes to UNESCO, established a few years before, apparently had ignited a nationalistic spirit that, unaccompanied by proper knowledge, unexpectedly created the polemic.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nIn November 2022, while Indonesia was still undecided on whether to accept the invitation for a joint nomination or to keep pursuing a single nomination, its four ASEAN neighbors declared their collective effort to submit\nkebaya\nas a shared heritage.

(Reuters/Dilara Senkaya)\nJ\nust over a year ago, China gave Bashar al-Assad and his wife a warm welcome during their six-day visit to the country, offering the former Syrian leader a rare break from years of international isolation since the start of a civil war in 2011.\nAs the couple attended the Asian Games, President Xi Jinping vowed to support Assad in \"opposing external interference\" and in Syria's rebuilding, while his wife Asma was feted in Chinese media.\nBut the abrupt end to the rule of the authoritarian leader so explicitly backed by Xi only last year has dealt a blow to China's diplomatic ambitions in the Middle East and exposed the limits of its strategy in the region, analysts say.\nA coalition of rebels seized Syria's capital Damascus on Sunday after a lightning offensive that toppled&nbsp;Assad's regime and ended his family's 50-year dynasty.\n\"There's been a lot of an exaggerated sense of China's ability to shape political outcomes in the region,\" said Jonathan Fulton, a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council.\nWhile the collapse of the Assad regime was seen reducing the influence in the Arab world of his main backers, Iran and Russia, it was also a blow for China's global ambitions, said Fulton.\n\"A lot of what (China has) been doing internationally has relied on support with those countries, and their inability to prop up their biggest partner in the Middle East says quite a lot about their ability to do much beyond the region.\"\nTackling Hotspots&nbsp;\nAfter China brokered a deal between long-time rivals Saudi Arabia and Iran in 2023, Chinese media praised Beijing's rising profile in a neighbourhood long dominated by Washington.&nbsp;\nWang Yi, China's top diplomat, said the country would play a constructive role in handling global \"hotspot issues\".\nChina also brokered a truce between Fatah, Hamas and other rival Palestinian factions earlier this year and has made repeated calls for a ceasefire in Gaza.\nBut despite bringing Middle Eastern leaders to Beijing and rounds of \"shuttle diplomacy\" by its Middle Eastern envoy, Zhai Jun, in the months since, Palestinians have not formed a unity government and the conflict in Gaza continues.\n\"Assad's sudden downfall is not a scenario Beijing wishes to see,\" said Fan Hongda, a Middle East scholar at Shanghai International Studies University. \"China prefers a more stable and independent Middle East, as chaos or a pro-American orientation in the region does not align with China's interests.\"&nbsp;\nThe response by China's foreign ministry to Assad's fall has been muted, focusing on the safety of Chinese nationals and calling for a \"political solution\" to restore stability in Syria as soon as possible.\nMinistry of foreign affairs spokesperson, Mao Ning, on Monday appeared to leave an opening for engagement with the future government: \"China's friendly relations with Syria are for all Syrian people,\" she said.\nChinese experts and diplomats say Beijing will now bide its time before recognising a new government in Damascus.&nbsp;\nIt could use its expertise and financial muscle to support reconstruction, they say, but its commitments are likely to be limited because China has sought to minimise financial risks overseas in recent years.\nSyria joined China's flagship Belt and Road Initiative in 2022, but there have been no significant investments by Chinese firms since, partly due to sanctions.&nbsp;\nChina is \"not really able to fundamentally replace the West either as an economic partner, or diplomatic or military force in the region,\" said Bill Figueroa, assistant professor at the University of Groningen and an expert in China-Middle East relations.\n\"China in 2024 has way less money than China in 2013 - 2014, when the BRI was launched,\" Figueroa said. There is \"an obvious reassessment going on in the direction of safer investments and reducing China's risks overall,\" he added.\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Article\nUN General Assembly calls for 'unconditional' Gaza ceasefire\nPentagon chief urges 'close consultation' between Israel and US on Syria\nIndonesia must regain credibility as an honest broker\nTrump\u2019s second term could deepen Indonesia-China relations\nIndonesia urges citizens to exercise caution during transition of power in Syria\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nMore in World\nView more\nEurope\nUS announces new arms aid package for Ukraine worth $500 million\nMiddle East and Africa\nUS says Israel is acting in Syria for its own defence\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia welcomes UNGA resolution on immediate ceasefire in Gaza\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo\u2019s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nAcademia\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?\nAcademia\nStop with the LGBTQ scapegoating\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities",

(AFP/Pool/Maxim Shipenkov)\nN\nearly three years after his last visit to India in December 2021, Russian President Vladimir Putin will be in New Delhi for the forthcoming reciprocal 23rd annual bilateral summit with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, pending the announcement of specific dates. Putin\u2019s visit will be at Modi\u2019s invitation, which was extended during their bilateral meeting on the sidelines of October\u2019s BRICS Summit in Kazan.\nThe two leaders had met earlier at the 22nd India-Russia summit, held on the sidelines of the Eastern Economic Forum in Russia in July. At that time, both sides reconfirmed their commitment to strengthen their \u201cspecial and privileged\u201d strategic partnership and its historical, time-tested and all-weather nature.\nThe upcoming summit is significant, as Putin\u2019s priority would be to advance multipolarity amid a rapidly changing global order from unipolar dominance to multipolar balance.\nThe declaration of the BRICS Summit in Kazan resembled a testament to building a fairer and more just world order, which will be represented by the voice of the Global South/global majority that remains marginalized in Western-centric international institutions.\nLike China, India is expected to be considered a civilizational state and an important partner in building a multipolar order in the emerging global balance of power led by Russia\u2019s initiative.\nRussian philosopher Alexander Dugin, whose ideas have much influence on the policies of Putin and Moscow, considers China, India and his country as civilizational states, rather than nation-states in the Westphalian model of international relations. For him, multipolarity should be based on dialogue among Russia, China and India as part of the Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa (BRICS) grouping that challenges Western dominance.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nDugin emphasizes the crucial role India can play in the new global order and balance of power, which includes liberation from a colonial mindset and keeping away from West-dominated narratives.\nThe discourse in academic and policy circles, especially in Russia and the Global South, questions Western dominance and the marginalization of non-Western voices and experiences. The debate calls for commitment to diversity, inclusiveness, pluralistic universalism and grounding in world history.\nBesides the NATO expansion to the East, political instability, the rebirth of fascism in Europe and the United States and confronting the new Cold War are the reasons for Russia\u2019s call to build a multipolar world order with the support of Turkey, Egypt, India, China, Brazil, South Africa and others, through Eurasian integration and strengthening multilateral platforms like BRICS, the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation and the Group of 20.\nBRICS is the most crucial institution in the new Cold War and for establishing a multipolar world order. The changing global context and cooperation with Russia in the Global South, especially under the BRICS framework, shows that isolating Russia is difficult.\nRussia is now committed to building a fairer and just multipolar world order as envisioned in the Kazan Declaration, which calls for strengthening multilateralism, enhancing economic cooperation, strengthening people-to-people exchanges, respecting the United Nations Charter and international law, fighting terrorism and climate change, among others.\nA consensus was sought about viewing \u201cunlawful unilateral coercive measures\u201d, such as sanctions, as detrimental to the global economy and Sustainable Development Goals. Therefore, the expanded BRICS agreed to de-dollarize and trade in national currencies.\nPutin sees the current significance of Russia, India and China in the East to confront Containment II, the US' post-Cold War containment policy, in the 21st century, in the same way Lenin observed in 1923 the significance of Russia\u2019s alliance with India and China for ensuring the success of socialism in its struggle against imperialist countries.\nIn the context of the emergence of a multipolar world, former US secretary of state Henry Kissinger said: \u201cIndia will be a fulcrum of 21st-century order: an indispensable element...\u201d\nPutin views that Russia, China and India\u2019s alliance might counter NATO expansion and neoliberal capitalism, strengthen multipolarity and ensure the emergence of a multipolar world order that is more democratic, equitable, prosperous and peaceful.\nIn a recent speech at Valdai International Discussion Club\u2019s plenary meeting in Sochi, Putin said, \u201cIndia should be included in the list of great powers,\u201d considering its fast technological and economic growth.\nThere is speculation that Putin may have played a role in bringing together Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping for a successful meeting at Kazan, where they agreed to keep the overall relationship cooperative, contribute to regional and global peace and act with a long-term view to advancing multipolarity.\nImportantly, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi asserted that Beijing and New Delhi were nonaligned, upheld multilateralism and would contribute to the process of building global multipolarity.\nIndian foreign minister S. Jaishankar, who met Wang on the sidelines of the recent G20 summit in Rio de Janeiro, said the two sides agreed to work together toward rebuilding trust and mutual understanding. Progress would be expected in resuming direct flights, exchanging journalists and facilitating visa issuance.\nAt the 22nd India-Russia summit, Putin and Modi reaffirmed their commitment to the countries\u2019 \u201cspecial and privileged strategic partnership\u201d.\nIndia also adopted a neutral position in the Ukraine-Russia war, urging the latter to resolve the conflict through dialogue and diplomacy in accordance with international law. After the outbreak of war in Ukraine, India-Russia trade expanded considerably.\nIndia is one of the main importers of Russian oil despite pressure from US-Western partners. The target is to increase the trade volume from US$65 billion in 2023 to $100 billion by 2030.\nNext year\u2019s 23rd India-Russia summit will reflect upon and review the partnership, discuss future directions and trajectories and a road map for cooperation toward building global multipolarity. Defense cooperation is the major focus of Russia\u2019s strategic partnership, though trade and economic cooperation is expanding.\nThe writer is an associate professor at Jawaharlal Nehru University\u2019s Centre for Russian and Central Asian Studies.

Rahmad announced Pupuk Indonesia\u2019s Green Ammonia Initiative from Aceh (GAIA). (Courtesy of Pupuk Indonesia)\nP\nT Pupuk Indonesia (Persero) took center stage at the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP29) in Baku, Azerbaijan, to announce the Green Ammonia Initiative from Aceh (GAIA). It is the world\u2019s first hybrid green ammonia project and aims to position Indonesia as a global leader in food security and sustainable energy solutions to help achieve the country\u2019s target of net-zero emissions by 2060.\nBy integrating water electrolysis, GAIA will enable Pupuk Iskandar Muda\u2019s (PIM) plants in Lhokseumawe, Aceh, to produce both conventional ammonia from natural gas and green ammonia from renewable hydrogen.\nThe natural gas is to be supplied by state oil and gas holding company PT Pertamina, while green hydrogen is to be supplied by state electricity firm PT PLN. Ammonia is mostly used as raw material for the production of nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium (NPK) and ammonium sulfate (ZA) fertilizers, as well as petrochemicals and similar applications.\n\u201cGAIA is more than asset optimization. It is a bold step toward sustainability that balances environmental, economic and security needs in food and energy,\u201d Pupuk Indonesia president director Rahmad Pribadi said at a panel discussion on Monday at the Indonesia Pavilion on the sidelines of COP29 in Baku.\nJoining Rahmad at the panel discussion were PT Astra International director Gita Tiffany Boer, PT Riau Andalan Pulp and Paper president director Sihol Aritonang, PT Medco Energi Internasional director and administrative officer Amri Siahaan and PT Vale Indonesia president director and CEO Febriany Eddy. The panel discussion was moderated by Efransjah.\nAs the largest end-based fertilizer producer in the Asia-Pacific, Middle East and North Africa regions, Pupuk Indonesia produces 14.5 million tonnes of fertilizers, of which 9.3 million tonnes are urea. In addition to fertilizers, the company produces a range of chemicals, including ammonia.\nTo produce and distribute green ammonia in Lhokseumawe, Pupuk Indonesia has formed a joint venture with Japan\u2019s Toyo Engineering Corporation and ITOCHU Corporation. Toyo will offer engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) expertise, and ITOCHU will support the marine bunkering supply chain.\nThe international partnership with Toyo and ITOCHU underscores Pupuk Indonesia\u2019s commitment to food security and global climate action, company representatives say. By combining local knowledge with global expertise, GAIA seeks to establish Indonesia as a significant player in the global food security and green energy landscape.\nThe development of GAIA is intended to optimize PIM\u2019s fertilizer production facilities, which for some time have suffered from dwindling supplies of natural gas from the nearby Arun gas field. The government has brought in liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Bontang in East Kalimantan and Tangguh in West Papua to revive PIM\u2019s fertilizer production facilities. Through GAIA, PIM is to be developed into Pupuk Indonesia\u2019s petrochemical cluster in the Western part of Indonesia.\nGAIA also aims to boost the downstream growth of Indonesia\u2019s chemical industry. As a crucial ingredient for fertilizers and industrial chemicals, green ammonia, produced using renewable energy and low-carbon technology, strengthens the entire chemical supply chain. The hybrid model can be replicated at other ammonia facilities in Indonesia and internationally.\n\u201cCurrently, most ammonia is used for petrochemicals, fertilizers and similar applications. However, in the future, ammonia will serve as a full transition fuel, which is important because it is carbon-free. In the next decade and beyond, the demand for ammonia will grow within the energy sector,\u201d Rahmad said.\nPupuk Indonesia will use two primary methods to produce clean ammonia, that is blue ammonia, which involves capturing and storing carbon emissions from traditional ammonia production, and green ammonia, which utilizes water and renewable energy to create ammonia directly.\nTo further this effort, the company has a road map for clean ammonia. The target is that by 2030, Pupuk Indonesia will produce hybrid ammonia using green hydrogen at Lhokseumawe through its subsidiary, PIM. By 2035, the company plans to introduce blue ammonia at a larger scale, growing its overall ammonia capacity from 7 million tonnes to 12.18 million tonnes per year, with most of it coming from clean ammonia.\nFurthermore, GAIA offers a wealth of economic and environmental benefits for Indonesia. By stimulating investment and job creation, this project will contribute to the nation\u2019s economic prosperity. The GAIA model could expand to other ammonia facilities across Indonesia, boosting domestic production.\nLocated in the Arun Special Economic Zone (SEZ) in Lhokseumawe, Aceh, GAIA leverages existing infrastructure to drive green investment and economic growth. With over 50 years of experience, Pupuk Indonesia seeks to establish the country as a global leader in green ammonia. This clean fuel has the potential to revolutionize the global maritime sector by 2050, reducing carbon emissions and promoting sustainable development.\n\u201cAs we advance the GAIA project, Pupuk Indonesia stands at the forefront of low-carbon innovation, setting a blueprint for decarbonizing Indonesia\u2019s fertilizer industry and establishing a replicable model for other countries seeking to develop green ammonia,\u201d Rahmad said.\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Article\nDid COP29 fail women?\nHow China misses great chances to prove its great status\nExpensive climate policy is dead, and it could be an immense opportunity\nIt\u2019s never about the climate\nBridging the climate finance gap: COP29\u2019s defining moment\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nMore in Front row\nView more\nFront Row\nThink Business, Think Hong Kong: Spotlighting Asia opportunities in Jakarta\nFront Row\nBPJS Kesehatan partners with stakeholders to build a fraud-free JKN ecosystem\nFront Row\nFore Coffee ends the year strong with hopeful prospects and locally focused products\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo\u2019s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nAcademia\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?\nAcademia\nStop with the LGBTQ scapegoating\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities",

(AFP/-)\nW\nith intense competition among the Superpowers on the development of and interface with artificial intelligence (AI), does China favor commitments which can converge with other countries?&nbsp;Common ground is certainly possible depending on the elements at hand, while uncommon chasms may also protrude portentously.&nbsp;\nSince 2023, China has been advocating for the Global AI Governance Initiative, which espouses a cooperative and consensus-based approach toward AI development that is people-centered. It underlines national sovereignty against manipulation and disinformation, while promoting mutual respect among nations. It upholds the protection of personal data and related risk assessment and management, backed by research aimed at transparency and predictability of AI.\nThe term \u201cethics\u201d enters its narrative to prevent discrimination, underpinned by the ethical review of&nbsp;AI development. The initiative also claims space for the voices of multiple stakeholders and the interests of developing countries. As a corollary, it is agreeable to the role of the United Nations in establishing an international framework to govern AI, interlinking between development, security and governance.\nThis initiative was bolstered in September 2024 by the publication of its AI Safety Governance Framework which delineates the challenges and necessary responses more specifically. This framework is a policy instrument which can be reinforced in parallel with specific laws or regulations. The framework categorizes various key risks and highlights actions to deal with them, while also targeting the various stakeholders in the AI techno-stream.\nIt lists various inherent safety risks such as those arising from models and algorithms, data and AI systems. These are compounded by risks in AI applications, in particular cyberspace risks, real world risks, cognitive risks and ethical risks.\nAn example of risks from algorithms (which are basically techno-models or digital formulae aimed at producing various outcomes) is that they are difficult to understand and must be more explainable and transparent to the public. Risks from data include illegal collection of data and intellectual property (IP) breaches. Risks from AI systems include exploitation, whether direct or indirect.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nCyber risks include cyber-attacks, matched by real world risks, such as criminal activities.&nbsp;Cognitive risks are shaped by mono-focal (rather than plural) information which limits the potential for broad analysis by the user, thus resulting in the \u201ccocoon\u201d effect, while ethical risks include discrimination and the widening gap relating to information know-how.\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Article\nNavigating Indonesia-US relations amid global and domestic changes\nChinese guards on the ground in Myanmar could go disastrously wrong\nIndonesia must regain credibility as an honest broker\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources\nIndonesia\u2019s drive for AI leadership in Southeast Asia\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nMore in Opinion\nView more\nAcademia\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo\u2019s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nAcademia\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?\nAcademia\nStop with the LGBTQ scapegoating\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities",

(Reuters/Athit Perawongmetha)\nW\ne call on outgoing President Joko \"Jokowi\" Widodo to use the worsening conflict along Myanmar's borders as an excuse to launch a new diplomatic offensive by engaging outside powers, especially China, to bring peace back to Myanmar.\nThe President could instruct Foreign Minister Retno LP Marsudi to immediately consult with her ASEAN counterparts to realize the initiative, for the sake of the well-being of millions of people in Myanmar, who have had to bear the brunt of the crisis.\nIndonesia should not hesitate to take this opportunity if it really intends to find a solution to the protracted conundrum in Myanmar. Since the Feb. 1, 2021, military coup in Myanmar, ASEAN has been persistent in dealing with the ensuing security and humanitarian crisis alone. Such rigidity is no longer relevant because it is evident that the Myanmar problem has spilled over to the region and beyond.\nIn their joint statement, issued after their summit in Jakarta in September last year, ASEAN leaders condemned the continuing acts of violence in Myanmar, which have caused prolonged suffering among the people, humanitarian crises and the destruction of public facilities, and have adversely impacted regional stability, particularly along the borders.\nThey decided to extend the temporary expulsion of the junta from any official meetings and functions of ASEAN until Myanmar\u2019s military junta complies with the five-point consensus (5PC). Such a tactic has proven ineffective, which is why ASEAN needs to find alternative measures.\nUnder Indonesia\u2019s chairmanship last year, ASEAN hardly made progress in solving the Myanmar cause. But now in the final months of his term, Jokowi&nbsp;can change the game.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nJokowi has a good personal relationship with Chinese President Xi Jinping. And the engagement of Beijing is not a na\u00efve consideration. Whoever is in power in Myanmar, China\u2019s influence in the country will remain strong.\nThe military junta has been facing more serious armed resistance in the last several months. Video footage has been spread by rebels that purportedly shows them gaining ground in Shan state, which borders China.\nChina was reportedly upset because the Myanmar junta ignored Beijing\u2019s warning about the security situation at the border, where criminals are targeting Chinese nationals.\nOn Monday, the Chinese Foreign Ministry\u2019s spokesperson Mao Ning said that China facilitated the evacuation of a number of countries\u2019 citizens, including Thai citizens, from northern Myanmar through China to avoid conflict and will continue to maintain communication with relevant countries and provide assistance.\nASEAN worries that civil war will continue raging in Myanmar, and the people\u2019s suffering will be prolonged.&nbsp;No matter how slim the chance is, Indonesia and ASEAN should not miss the opportunity to end the Myanmar crisis.

(JP/Deni Ghifari)\nI\nn November, President\nPrabowo Subianto\nvisited China, the United States, Peru, Brazil, the United Kingdom and United Arab Emirates (UAE)&nbsp;to strengthen bilateral and multilateral ties, highlighting Indonesia's growing influence in Asia and the Americas.\nAs 2025 approaches, the global landscape remains multipolar, with rising US-China&nbsp;tensions. Following the Non-Aligned Movement, Indonesia pursues an independent foreign policy prioritizing its national interests. Its strategic position along key maritime trade routes enhances its role in regional stability and global commerce.\nWhile China aims to reduce competitors' influence, Indonesia leverages its relationship with China to negotiate with the US and other advanced economies. However, Indonesia must carefully engage with China to protect its security and sovereignty. President Prabowo has reiterated his commitment to cooperation with China, but this evolving dynamic has overshadowed US diplomatic efforts. For a more effective approach, the US should reassess its policies toward Indonesia and focus on building strong economic partnerships.\nIn recent years, Indonesia has fundamentally redefined its maritime strategy,&nbsp;particularly under former president Joko \u201cJokowi\u201d Widodo\u2019s administration, enhancing its role in the Indo-Pacific with a strategic naval policy. This evolution positions Indonesia as a vital player in regional security and governance.\nAs the US and Indonesia celebrate 75 years of diplomatic ties, their relationship has evolved into a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership (CSP), reinforcing cooperation in addressing global challenges. This partnership is crucial for stability and prosperity, aligning with Indonesia's strategic goals through initiatives like the Indo-Pacific&nbsp;Economic Framework (IPEF). Together, they aim to strengthen maritime security and foster sustainable economic development, paving the way for a resilient future for the region.\nOn Nov. 12, during a formal meeting in Washington, DC, US President Joe Biden and President Prabowo&nbsp;discussed strategic initiatives to build a strong and lasting partnership. They emphasized the critical need to strengthen bilateral defense collaboration to improve regional and global security. A major focus of their discussions was enhancing advanced maritime security capabilities and coordinating operations to combat illegal transnational organized crime.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nThey also placed emphasis on developing integrated intelligence-sharing protocols and creating joint operational frameworks to effectively address emerging security challenges.\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Article\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?\nStop with the LGBTQ scapegoating\nRussia teams up with BRICS to create AI alliance\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nMore in Opinion\nView more\nAcademia\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo\u2019s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nPolitics\nIndonesia to pardon tens of thousands including Papua activists\nAcademia\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?\nAcademia\nStop with the LGBTQ scapegoating",

(AFP/Pool/Maxim Shipenkov)\nN\nearly three years after his last visit to India in December 2021, Russian President Vladimir Putin will be in New Delhi for the forthcoming reciprocal 23rd annual bilateral summit with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, pending the announcement of specific dates. Putin\u2019s visit will be at Modi\u2019s invitation, which was extended during their bilateral meeting on the sidelines of October\u2019s BRICS Summit in Kazan.\nThe two leaders had met earlier at the 22nd India-Russia summit, held on the sidelines of the Eastern Economic Forum in Russia in July. At that time, both sides reconfirmed their commitment to strengthen their \u201cspecial and privileged\u201d strategic partnership and its historical, time-tested and all-weather nature.\nThe upcoming summit is significant, as Putin\u2019s priority would be to advance multipolarity amid a rapidly changing global order from unipolar dominance to multipolar balance.\nThe declaration of the BRICS Summit in Kazan resembled a testament to building a fairer and more just world order, which will be represented by the voice of the Global South/global majority that remains marginalized in Western-centric international institutions.\nLike China, India is expected to be considered a civilizational state and an important partner in building a multipolar order in the emerging global balance of power led by Russia\u2019s initiative.\nRussian philosopher Alexander Dugin, whose ideas have much influence on the policies of Putin and Moscow, considers China, India and his country as civilizational states, rather than nation-states in the Westphalian model of international relations. For him, multipolarity should be based on dialogue among Russia, China and India as part of the Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa (BRICS) grouping that challenges Western dominance.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nDugin emphasizes the crucial role India can play in the new global order and balance of power, which includes liberation from a colonial mindset and keeping away from West-dominated narratives.\nThe discourse in academic and policy circles, especially in Russia and the Global South, questions Western dominance and the marginalization of non-Western voices and experiences. The debate calls for commitment to diversity, inclusiveness, pluralistic universalism and grounding in world history.\nBesides the NATO expansion to the East, political instability, the rebirth of fascism in Europe and the United States and confronting the new Cold War are the reasons for Russia\u2019s call to build a multipolar world order with the support of Turkey, Egypt, India, China, Brazil, South Africa and others, through Eurasian integration and strengthening multilateral platforms like BRICS, the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation and the Group of 20.\nBRICS is the most crucial institution in the new Cold War and for establishing a multipolar world order. The changing global context and cooperation with Russia in the Global South, especially under the BRICS framework, shows that isolating Russia is difficult.\nRussia is now committed to building a fairer and just multipolar world order as envisioned in the Kazan Declaration, which calls for strengthening multilateralism, enhancing economic cooperation, strengthening people-to-people exchanges, respecting the United Nations Charter and international law, fighting terrorism and climate change, among others.\nA consensus was sought about viewing \u201cunlawful unilateral coercive measures\u201d, such as sanctions, as detrimental to the global economy and Sustainable Development Goals. Therefore, the expanded BRICS agreed to de-dollarize and trade in national currencies.\nPutin sees the current significance of Russia, India and China in the East to confront Containment II, the US' post-Cold War containment policy, in the 21st century, in the same way Lenin observed in 1923 the significance of Russia\u2019s alliance with India and China for ensuring the success of socialism in its struggle against imperialist countries.\nIn the context of the emergence of a multipolar world, former US secretary of state Henry Kissinger said: \u201cIndia will be a fulcrum of 21st-century order: an indispensable element...\u201d\nPutin views that Russia, China and India\u2019s alliance might counter NATO expansion and neoliberal capitalism, strengthen multipolarity and ensure the emergence of a multipolar world order that is more democratic, equitable, prosperous and peaceful.\nIn a recent speech at Valdai International Discussion Club\u2019s plenary meeting in Sochi, Putin said, \u201cIndia should be included in the list of great powers,\u201d considering its fast technological and economic growth.\nThere is speculation that Putin may have played a role in bringing together Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping for a successful meeting at Kazan, where they agreed to keep the overall relationship cooperative, contribute to regional and global peace and act with a long-term view to advancing multipolarity.\nImportantly, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi asserted that Beijing and New Delhi were nonaligned, upheld multilateralism and would contribute to the process of building global multipolarity.\nIndian foreign minister S. Jaishankar, who met Wang on the sidelines of the recent G20 summit in Rio de Janeiro, said the two sides agreed to work together toward rebuilding trust and mutual understanding. Progress would be expected in resuming direct flights, exchanging journalists and facilitating visa issuance.\nAt the 22nd India-Russia summit, Putin and Modi reaffirmed their commitment to the countries\u2019 \u201cspecial and privileged strategic partnership\u201d.\nIndia also adopted a neutral position in the Ukraine-Russia war, urging the latter to resolve the conflict through dialogue and diplomacy in accordance with international law. After the outbreak of war in Ukraine, India-Russia trade expanded considerably.\nIndia is one of the main importers of Russian oil despite pressure from US-Western partners. The target is to increase the trade volume from US$65 billion in 2023 to $100 billion by 2030.\nNext year\u2019s 23rd India-Russia summit will reflect upon and review the partnership, discuss future directions and trajectories and a road map for cooperation toward building global multipolarity. Defense cooperation is the major focus of Russia\u2019s strategic partnership, though trade and economic cooperation is expanding.\nThe writer is an associate professor at Jawaharlal Nehru University\u2019s Centre for Russian and Central Asian Studies.

Rahmad announced Pupuk Indonesia\u2019s Green Ammonia Initiative from Aceh (GAIA). (Courtesy of Pupuk Indonesia)\nP\nT Pupuk Indonesia (Persero) took center stage at the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP29) in Baku, Azerbaijan, to announce the Green Ammonia Initiative from Aceh (GAIA). It is the world\u2019s first hybrid green ammonia project and aims to position Indonesia as a global leader in food security and sustainable energy solutions to help achieve the country\u2019s target of net-zero emissions by 2060.\nBy integrating water electrolysis, GAIA will enable Pupuk Iskandar Muda\u2019s (PIM) plants in Lhokseumawe, Aceh, to produce both conventional ammonia from natural gas and green ammonia from renewable hydrogen.\nThe natural gas is to be supplied by state oil and gas holding company PT Pertamina, while green hydrogen is to be supplied by state electricity firm PT PLN. Ammonia is mostly used as raw material for the production of nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium (NPK) and ammonium sulfate (ZA) fertilizers, as well as petrochemicals and similar applications.\n\u201cGAIA is more than asset optimization. It is a bold step toward sustainability that balances environmental, economic and security needs in food and energy,\u201d Pupuk Indonesia president director Rahmad Pribadi said at a panel discussion on Monday at the Indonesia Pavilion on the sidelines of COP29 in Baku.\nJoining Rahmad at the panel discussion were PT Astra International director Gita Tiffany Boer, PT Riau Andalan Pulp and Paper president director Sihol Aritonang, PT Medco Energi Internasional director and administrative officer Amri Siahaan and PT Vale Indonesia president director and CEO Febriany Eddy. The panel discussion was moderated by Efransjah.\nAs the largest end-based fertilizer producer in the Asia-Pacific, Middle East and North Africa regions, Pupuk Indonesia produces 14.5 million tonnes of fertilizers, of which 9.3 million tonnes are urea. In addition to fertilizers, the company produces a range of chemicals, including ammonia.\nTo produce and distribute green ammonia in Lhokseumawe, Pupuk Indonesia has formed a joint venture with Japan\u2019s Toyo Engineering Corporation and ITOCHU Corporation. Toyo will offer engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) expertise, and ITOCHU will support the marine bunkering supply chain.\nThe international partnership with Toyo and ITOCHU underscores Pupuk Indonesia\u2019s commitment to food security and global climate action, company representatives say. By combining local knowledge with global expertise, GAIA seeks to establish Indonesia as a significant player in the global food security and green energy landscape.\nThe development of GAIA is intended to optimize PIM\u2019s fertilizer production facilities, which for some time have suffered from dwindling supplies of natural gas from the nearby Arun gas field. The government has brought in liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Bontang in East Kalimantan and Tangguh in West Papua to revive PIM\u2019s fertilizer production facilities. Through GAIA, PIM is to be developed into Pupuk Indonesia\u2019s petrochemical cluster in the Western part of Indonesia.\nGAIA also aims to boost the downstream growth of Indonesia\u2019s chemical industry. As a crucial ingredient for fertilizers and industrial chemicals, green ammonia, produced using renewable energy and low-carbon technology, strengthens the entire chemical supply chain. The hybrid model can be replicated at other ammonia facilities in Indonesia and internationally.\n\u201cCurrently, most ammonia is used for petrochemicals, fertilizers and similar applications. However, in the future, ammonia will serve as a full transition fuel, which is important because it is carbon-free. In the next decade and beyond, the demand for ammonia will grow within the energy sector,\u201d Rahmad said.\nPupuk Indonesia will use two primary methods to produce clean ammonia, that is blue ammonia, which involves capturing and storing carbon emissions from traditional ammonia production, and green ammonia, which utilizes water and renewable energy to create ammonia directly.\nTo further this effort, the company has a road map for clean ammonia. The target is that by 2030, Pupuk Indonesia will produce hybrid ammonia using green hydrogen at Lhokseumawe through its subsidiary, PIM. By 2035, the company plans to introduce blue ammonia at a larger scale, growing its overall ammonia capacity from 7 million tonnes to 12.18 million tonnes per year, with most of it coming from clean ammonia.\nFurthermore, GAIA offers a wealth of economic and environmental benefits for Indonesia. By stimulating investment and job creation, this project will contribute to the nation\u2019s economic prosperity. The GAIA model could expand to other ammonia facilities across Indonesia, boosting domestic production.\nLocated in the Arun Special Economic Zone (SEZ) in Lhokseumawe, Aceh, GAIA leverages existing infrastructure to drive green investment and economic growth. With over 50 years of experience, Pupuk Indonesia seeks to establish the country as a global leader in green ammonia. This clean fuel has the potential to revolutionize the global maritime sector by 2050, reducing carbon emissions and promoting sustainable development.\n\u201cAs we advance the GAIA project, Pupuk Indonesia stands at the forefront of low-carbon innovation, setting a blueprint for decarbonizing Indonesia\u2019s fertilizer industry and establishing a replicable model for other countries seeking to develop green ammonia,\u201d Rahmad said.\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Article\nDid COP29 fail women?\nHow China misses great chances to prove its great status\nExpensive climate policy is dead, and it could be an immense opportunity\nIt\u2019s never about the climate\nBridging the climate finance gap: COP29\u2019s defining moment\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nMore in Front row\nView more\nFront Row\nThink Business, Think Hong Kong: Spotlighting Asia opportunities in Jakarta\nFront Row\nBPJS Kesehatan partners with stakeholders to build a fraud-free JKN ecosystem\nFront Row\nFore Coffee ends the year strong with hopeful prospects and locally focused products\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo\u2019s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nPolitics\nIndonesia to pardon tens of thousands including Papua activists\nAcademia\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?\nAcademia\nStop with the LGBTQ scapegoating",

(AFP/Alexander Nemenov/Pool)\nVersi Bahasa Indonesia\nI\nn stark contrast to his predecessor's hands-off approach to international relations, President\nPrabowo Subianto\nhas demonstrated a bold foreign policy approach just two weeks into his term, notably by teasing potential accession to BRICS.\nFresh from attending the BRICS Summit in Russia, Foreign Minister Sugiono, a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 from Prabowo\u2019s Gerindra Party, expressed the government\u2019s intention for Indonesia to join the group of emerging economies.\nMany consider the pursuit of BRICS membership proof of Prabowo\u2019s \u201cgood neighbor\u201d policy. This also resonates with the country\u2019s free and active foreign policy stance, which led to first president Sukarno founding the Non-Aligned Movement at the height of the Cold War.\nHowever, it would be prudent to subject any future diplomatic maneuvers to careful scrutiny, taking into account their potential consequences vis-\u00e1-vis contemporary contexts.\nIt is well understood that Indonesia\u2019s accession to BRICS will serve more geopolitical than economic purposes. This is not only because the country has established more fruitful bilateral ties with individual BRICS member states, but also because the grouping\u2019s economic engagement has been scarce and short of concrete actions.\nAside from setting up the New Development Bank, a multilateral development bank mainly supported by China, it hasn\u2019t launched any economic or development initiatives that benefit its members or other emerging economies.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nTrue, the group has plans to push for de-dollarization to help reduce global dependence on the US currency, especially amid the Federal Reserve\u2019s hawkish stance in past years. But this, too, hasn\u2019t been implemented.\nIn fact, Indonesia has taken more progressive action by establishing a local currency settlement system with its ASEAN peers and major trading partners, such as China and Japan.\nMoreover, insofar as the geopolitical polarization and fragmentation in international trade were rooted in the big power rivalry during the Cold War, the countries involved have evolved and gone on to pursue their own interests, which are vastly different to those that shaped international relations in the 1960s.\nCountries today are less motivated by the ideological war between capitalism and communism of the past. Democracy and capitalism, despite their flaws, have been largely adopted across the world to fit each country\u2019s political and economic contexts. China, for example, has been hailed for its system of state capitalism.\nIn addition, almost all countries have embraced international trade, regardless of their political leanings.\nMore and more countries are looking to India, which has managed to sail through the current geopolitical tensions and benefited from the competing major economies, strengthening its economic ties with the US while continuing to buy oil from Russia.\nAt the BRICS Summit in Kazan, Chinese President Xi Jinping and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi met in their first bilateral talks in five years since they agreed to resolve their countries\u2019 military standoff on the disputed Himalayan borders.\nIndonesia\u2019s decision to join BRICS is not unique. Other ASEAN countries including Malaysia, Vietnam and Thailand have also expressed interest in joining the group and, like Indonesia, have become partner countries of BRICS.\nUnder Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, Malaysia might also deserve credit for maintaining good relations with both Russia and China while still securing significant investments from Big Tech like Apple and Microsoft.\nBy joining BRICS now, Indonesia could recoup last year\u2019s wasted opportunities of then-president Joko \u201cJokowi\u201d Widodo, who made a rare attendance at a major international event by joining the BRICS Summit in Johannesburg, only to announce afterward that becoming a member was \u201cnot urgent\u201d.\nThe Jokowi administration later began the process of its accession to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), which was seen as a move to adhere to Western economic and trade principles to gain wider access to the global supply chain.\nWhat Prabowo and his administration must consider is which ties can advance Indonesia\u2019s interests at the end of the day.\nWhile it is fine to be a good neighbor, it will not feel so great when it is always one\u2019s neighbors that keep benefiting and prospering from a one-sided relationship.\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Article\nPrabowo\u2019s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nMalaysia says any US tariffs on BRICS could impact semiconductor supply\nActivists protest rejection of dog and cat meat trade ban\nRevisiting Indonesia\u2019s surprising BRICS plan\nIndonesia's BRICS membership: A strategic leap into a new global era\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nMore in Opinion\nView more\nAcademia\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo\u2019s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nAcademia\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?\nAcademia\nStop with the LGBTQ scapegoating\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities",

(AFP/-)\nW\nith intense competition among the Superpowers on the development of and interface with artificial intelligence (AI), does China favor commitments which can converge with other countries?&nbsp;Common ground is certainly possible depending on the elements at hand, while uncommon chasms may also protrude portentously.&nbsp;\nSince 2023, China has been advocating for the Global AI Governance Initiative, which espouses a cooperative and consensus-based approach toward AI development that is people-centered. It underlines national sovereignty against manipulation and disinformation, while promoting mutual respect among nations. It upholds the protection of personal data and related risk assessment and management, backed by research aimed at transparency and predictability of AI.\nThe term \u201cethics\u201d enters its narrative to prevent discrimination, underpinned by the ethical review of&nbsp;AI development. The initiative also claims space for the voices of multiple stakeholders and the interests of developing countries. As a corollary, it is agreeable to the role of the United Nations in establishing an international framework to govern AI, interlinking between development, security and governance.\nThis initiative was bolstered in September 2024 by the publication of its AI Safety Governance Framework which delineates the challenges and necessary responses more specifically. This framework is a policy instrument which can be reinforced in parallel with specific laws or regulations. The framework categorizes various key risks and highlights actions to deal with them, while also targeting the various stakeholders in the AI techno-stream.\nIt lists various inherent safety risks such as those arising from models and algorithms, data and AI systems. These are compounded by risks in AI applications, in particular cyberspace risks, real world risks, cognitive risks and ethical risks.\nAn example of risks from algorithms (which are basically techno-models or digital formulae aimed at producing various outcomes) is that they are difficult to understand and must be more explainable and transparent to the public. Risks from data include illegal collection of data and intellectual property (IP) breaches. Risks from AI systems include exploitation, whether direct or indirect.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nCyber risks include cyber-attacks, matched by real world risks, such as criminal activities.&nbsp;Cognitive risks are shaped by mono-focal (rather than plural) information which limits the potential for broad analysis by the user, thus resulting in the \u201ccocoon\u201d effect, while ethical risks include discrimination and the widening gap relating to information know-how.\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Article\nNavigating Indonesia-US relations amid global and domestic changes\nChinese guards on the ground in Myanmar could go disastrously wrong\nIndonesia must regain credibility as an honest broker\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources\nIndonesia\u2019s drive for AI leadership in Southeast Asia\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nMore in Opinion\nView more\nAcademia\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo\u2019s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nPolitics\nIndonesia to pardon tens of thousands including Papua activists\nAcademia\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?\nAcademia\nStop with the LGBTQ scapegoating",

(Antara/Wahdi Septiawan)\nT\nhere are always two sides to a story. But when it comes to the climate crisis, the world needs to pay closer attention to the provided by developing nations.\nIndeed, the countries of the developing world, including Indonesia, have a unique story to share and obligations to their people, millions of who live below the poverty line. Our climate actions must work to support these people, not further disadvantage them.\nThis week, Indonesia put this narrative at the forefront by presenting its approach to a just and clean energy transition on the sidelines of the 79th United Nations General Assembly, which ran from Sept. 20 to 28 at the UN headquarters in New York.\nThe\nIndonesian Just Transition White Paper\nshowcases the unique approach Indonesia will take to the just transition, and gives developing countries a reference point for global climate action.\nBy demonstrating ownership of the just transition, the white paper also provides a critical piece of climate advocacy for developing nations as they disproportionately bear the brunt of the worsening climate crisis. Their vulnerability to climate impacts, coupled with their growing appetite for clean energy, put them in a position to lead with innovative, context-specific solutions that can shape a more equitable and effective global response.\nIndonesia stands as a powerful example of how a developing nation can lead sustainable development, from ambitious reforestation efforts to substantial investments in renewable energy. These initiatives not only protect the environment but also empower local communities and most importantly, uphold the right to grow and prosper.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nThe\nIndonesian Just Energy White Paper\nwill therefore guide future administrations and reinforce the role of developing countries in climate leadership.\nProduced by the implementation team of the National Energy Transition Task Force (Satgas TEN), the socioeconomic and environmental working group and other stakeholders, including development partners, the white paper aims to define and establish a definition, framework and government approach for a just transition in Indonesia.\nWith its overarching theme, this document can be a reference for future policies, planning and implementation of Indonesia\u2019 just transition in the energy sector: promoting environmental sustainability and social equality, such as better jobs, alongside targeted social protection.\nAccording to the Institute for Essential Services Reform (IESR), a local think tank, job losses in Indonesia could reach between 25,000 and 252,000 by 2050 due to the phasing out of coal. The economic impact is more severe in coal-producing regions, such as Muara Enim in South Sumatra and Paser in East Kalimantan, which could lose over Rp 96.9 trillion (US$6.4 billion) in revenue without intervention.\nIn fact, more than 50 percent of these regions\u2019 gross regional domestic product is tied to the coal mining industry. This poses challenges for labor reallocation, given the possible lack of local employment alternatives.\nIndonesia\u2019s coal-producing regions will face significant social and economic disruption, just as other nations have experienced in the past following a structural decline in coal demand. The white paper therefore calls on all stakeholders to ensure that communities are supported and empowered throughout the transition process.\nMeanwhile, it seeks to ensure that Indonesians can enjoy maximum benefits from the new job opportunities the energy transition can bring as new, clean energy generation and transmission networks are built and maintained and more communities are able to enjoy reliable power, day and night.\nAnother highlight of the white paper is its focus on women and other disadvantaged groups. A UN Women report suggests that by 2050, climate change might push 158 million more women and girls into extreme poverty and 232 million to experience food insecurity. The UN Environment Programme estimates that women and girls, who are more prone to poverty, violence or unintended pregnancies, make up 80 percent of the people displaced by climate change.\nAs women have historically not had proportional access to the country's socioeconomic benefits, it is crucial to aim for gender equality in the just transition, from workforce composition to compensation recipients. This includes ensuring that women and disadvantaged groups are fully represented in the decision-making process related to the energy transition.\nAs the world moves toward a greener future, it is equally important for developing countries like Indonesia to recognize the economic risks and opportunities that the climate crisis presents, especially as Indonesia aims to become the world\u2019s fourth-largest economy in 2050, just one rank below the United States.\nAccording to the National Development Planning Agency (Bappenas) however, the country could experience potential GDP loss of 3.54 percent in 2050 if it does not transform its energy system, making the just and clean energy transition a more urgent task.\nBut balancing the urgency for a just and clean energy transition with robust economic growth to protect communities and alleviate poverty is a continuing delicate task.\nThe\nIndonesian Just Energy White Paper\nis a declaration of intent, reiterating Indonesia\u2019s climate commitments and aiming to ensure shared prosperity, where balance can be achieved.\nIt is a set of guidelines that can help developing nations redefine the global narrative on climate action, ensuring that this action reflects the needs of all, especially the most vulnerable.\nIt is the other side of the story, which history will reflect as a key part of global climate justice.\n***\nThe writer is deputy of environment and forestry management coordination at the Office of the Coordinating Maritime Affairs and Investment Minister.\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Article\nWhy corruption could derail Indonesia\u2019s climate fight\nG20 Brazil: Lessons for an effective cooperation platform\nJETP: A top-down approach cannot deliver a just transition\nSupreme Court to host meeting with judges on demands for higher pay\nUS says \u2018forced labor\u2019 designation for RI nickel won\u2019t prompt sanctions\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nMore in Opinion\nView more\nAcademia\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo\u2019s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nPolitics\nIndonesia to pardon tens of thousands including Papua activists\nAcademia\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?\nAcademia\nStop with the LGBTQ scapegoating",

(AFP/Romeo Gacad)\nI\nt is notorious that violent exploitation of other civilizations in the form of colonialism and that slavery played a fundamental role in the enrichment of the West and maintaining its dominance. Though former metropoles may deny it, these dark pages are etched indelibly in history.\nToday, the West, headed by the United States, while implementing neocolonial practices seeks to hamper the natural development of global processes, keep an unbalanced model of the global economy, eliminate competitors in the military-political and economic fields as well as retain its elusive dominance. The West is trying to replace the emerging multipolar world architecture with a \u201crules-based world order\u201d that in fact is an updated version of colonialism.\nThe concept \u201cneocolonialism\u201d has been current since the mid-20th century and is used in relation to the policy of the former metropoles aimed at restraining development of young nations that have&nbsp;barely gained formal independence, as well as at compensating those territorial and material losses that the metropoles suffered as a result of decolonization.\nNeo-metropolitan powers target their disruptive efforts to control the natural wealth of developing countries. According to some calculations, the West drained over US$62 trillion worth of raw materials from Global South countries between 1960 and 2018. To pursue these goals the Western countries induce developing countries to borrow at overcharged interest rates.\nAccording to the United Nations Global Crisis Response Group on Food, Energy and Finance, countries in Asia and Oceania borrow at an average rate of 6.5 percent, Latin America and the Caribbean at 7.7 percent&nbsp;and Africa at 11.6 percent. At the same time, borrowing costs for the US stand at 3.1 percent and for Germany 1.5 percent.\nThe practice of coup d\u2019etat and military interventions is widely used. Some experts claim that the US interfered in elections in other countries more than 80 times between 1946 and 2000. Sanctions are also imposed.&nbsp;Out of 174 cases of restrictive measures applied in the 20\nth\ncentury, the US was responsible for 109.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nWhile pretending to care about the environment, rich states force countries across the Global South to adopt regulations on \u201cpreserving environment\u201d that disregard national interests. In practice, they promote \u201cclimate neocolonialism\u201d.\nEven while offering humanitarian assistance projects, the West primarily cherishes its own interests. Food-deprived states in Africa and Asia received only 3 percent out of the total 32.8 million tonnes under the Black Sea Initiative on the distribution of Ukrainian grain.\nNeocolonial views of the representatives of the so-called \u201cgolden billion\u201d can be clearly seen via their statements. For instance, Josep Borrell, the European Union High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, said \u201cEurope is a garden, whereas the rest of the world is a jungle\u201d.\nAnother illustrative example is the serious debate in the Netherlands on whether to withdraw the official apologies regarding the war crimes committed by the Dutch against the Indonesians during the independence war in 1945-1949.\nWithout any doubt, coordination of the approaches of the world majority countries is necessary to establish a completely new system of international relations based on the principles of respect and well-wishing non-interference.\nOn June 17-18, the first meeting of the Permanent Committee of the Antineocolonial Movement for the Freedom of Nations was held in Vladivostok, Russia.\nIn his opening remarks, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said new power centers, including the BRICS, the leaders of the African Union, ASEAN, SELAC and other integration unions of the global majority, played a key role in its context. He added that it was necessary to work toward strengthening their positions in the international institutions, primarily the UN Security Council and Group of 20, especially after the African Union\u2019s accession to the group.\nBy joining the final declaration, Russia and more than 150 representatives of leading political parties and public organizations from 32 countries, including Indonesia, emphasized their commitment to build a just and multipolar world based on the purposes and principles enshrined in the UN Charter.\nThe selective implementation of universal norms of international law and the use of unilaterally imposed illegal restrictive measures to evade the UN Charter were&nbsp;condemned.\nThe participants in the forum declared their desire to expand cooperation among the countries of the world majority in order to counter mechanisms of political and economic blackmail and restrictions on the sovereign equality of states.\nThey noted the unacceptability of imposing on the world majority certain norms in the elaboration of which the equal participation of all interested states has not been ensured, as well as the vicious system of double standards and the deliberate politicization of issues related to the observance of human rights and the development of democracy.\nVarious forms of falsification of history aimed at achieving certain geopolitical goals, attempts to consign crimes of the colonial era to oblivion as well as the deliberate dissemination by metropoles of false, untrue, misleading and socially dangerous information regarding the era of colonial conquests were denounced.\nI am convinced that the very movements that unite progressive political forces of Eurasia, Africa and Latin America can make a significant contribution to forming a fair and polycentric world order by genuine democratization of the established mechanisms of global governance, implementation of the principles of inclusive multilateralism, sovereign equality, non-interference, peaceful coexistence between countries with different political and social systems, mutual understanding and respect.\nThe aim is to build a bright future for&nbsp;the whole international community and prevent the revival of neocolonial practices.&nbsp;\n***\nThe writer is Russian ambassador to Indonesia.\n&nbsp;\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Article\nMegawati supports free meals program, with caveat\nRussia teams up with BRICS to create AI alliance\nWars, regional tensions boost arms sales: report\nIs Sritex too big to fail?\nTo remain relevant, ASEAN must address the crucial issues in its vision 2045\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nMore in Opinion\nView more\nAcademia\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo\u2019s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nPolitics\nIndonesia to pardon tens of thousands including Papua activists\nAcademia\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?\nAcademia\nStop with the LGBTQ scapegoating",

(Reuters /Tingshu Wang)\nUnited States Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said on Saturday that the global transition to a low-carbon economy requires $3 trillion in new capital each year through 2050, far above current annual financing, but that filling the gap is the biggest economic opportunity of the 21st century.\nYellen said in Belem, Brazil's Amazon gateway city, that reaching net-zero emissions goals remained a top priority for the Biden-Harris administration and this would require leadership far beyond US borders.\n\"Neglecting to address climate change and the loss of nature and biodiversity is not just bad environmental policy. It is bad economic policy,\" Yellen said in a speech after attending a G20 finance leaders meeting on Thursday and Friday in Rio de Janeiro.\nWealthy economies provided and mobilized a record $116 billion for climate finance for developing countries in 2022, 40 percent&nbsp;of which came from multilateral development banks (MDBs). Yellen said the banks, including the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) were setting new targets.\nThe financing need is \"the single-greatest economic opportunity of the 21st century\" and can be leveraged to support sustainable and more inclusive growth, including for investment-starved countries, she said.\nWhile in Belem, Yellen met with finance ministers from Amazon basin countries and IDB President Ilan Goldfajn.

She said this was \"now in their DNA,\" but massive private investment was needed, and the Treasury, Brazil's finance ministry and other stakeholders were working to boost engagement with the private sector.\nShe said the banks should also catalyze new business models to mobilize investments that support nature and biodiversity while strengthening economies and advancing climate transitions.\nEarlier on Saturday, Yellen launched a new initiative with Amazon basin countries Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Peru, and Suriname to combat nature crimes, such as illegal logging and harvesting of wildlife and minerals, that are threatening biodiversity and the Amazon ecosystem.\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Article\n2024 will be the hottest year on record, EU scientists say\nTop UN court to open unprecedented climate hearings\nGlobal wine output to hit lowest level since 1961\nIndonesia in talks with US, Russia for nuclear power technology\nIndonesia vows to \u2018enhance climate actions\u2019, Hashim tells COP29\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nMore in Business\nView more\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nTech\nMinister says Apple 'losing out' by dragging its feet on $1b investment\nRegulations\nMinistry inks collab with army, police on food security\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo\u2019s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nPolitics\nIndonesia to pardon tens of thousands including Papua activists\nAcademia\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?\nAcademia\nStop with the LGBTQ scapegoating",

(AFP/Romeo Gacad)\nI\nt is notorious that violent exploitation of other civilizations in the form of colonialism and that slavery played a fundamental role in the enrichment of the West and maintaining its dominance. Though former metropoles may deny it, these dark pages are etched indelibly in history.\nToday, the West, headed by the United States, while implementing neocolonial practices seeks to hamper the natural development of global processes, keep an unbalanced model of the global economy, eliminate competitors in the military-political and economic fields as well as retain its elusive dominance. The West is trying to replace the emerging multipolar world architecture with a \u201crules-based world order\u201d that in fact is an updated version of colonialism.\nThe concept \u201cneocolonialism\u201d has been current since the mid-20th century and is used in relation to the policy of the former metropoles aimed at restraining development of young nations that have&nbsp;barely gained formal independence, as well as at compensating those territorial and material losses that the metropoles suffered as a result of decolonization.\nNeo-metropolitan powers target their disruptive efforts to control the natural wealth of developing countries. According to some calculations, the West drained over US$62 trillion worth of raw materials from Global South countries between 1960 and 2018. To pursue these goals the Western countries induce developing countries to borrow at overcharged interest rates.\nAccording to the United Nations Global Crisis Response Group on Food, Energy and Finance, countries in Asia and Oceania borrow at an average rate of 6.5 percent, Latin America and the Caribbean at 7.7 percent&nbsp;and Africa at 11.6 percent. At the same time, borrowing costs for the US stand at 3.1 percent and for Germany 1.5 percent.\nThe practice of coup d\u2019etat and military interventions is widely used. Some experts claim that the US interfered in elections in other countries more than 80 times between 1946 and 2000. Sanctions are also imposed.&nbsp;Out of 174 cases of restrictive measures applied in the 20\nth\ncentury, the US was responsible for 109.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nWhile pretending to care about the environment, rich states force countries across the Global South to adopt regulations on \u201cpreserving environment\u201d that disregard national interests. In practice, they promote \u201cclimate neocolonialism\u201d.\nEven while offering humanitarian assistance projects, the West primarily cherishes its own interests. Food-deprived states in Africa and Asia received only 3 percent out of the total 32.8 million tonnes under the Black Sea Initiative on the distribution of Ukrainian grain.\nNeocolonial views of the representatives of the so-called \u201cgolden billion\u201d can be clearly seen via their statements. For instance, Josep Borrell, the European Union High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, said \u201cEurope is a garden, whereas the rest of the world is a jungle\u201d.\nAnother illustrative example is the serious debate in the Netherlands on whether to withdraw the official apologies regarding the war crimes committed by the Dutch against the Indonesians during the independence war in 1945-1949.\nWithout any doubt, coordination of the approaches of the world majority countries is necessary to establish a completely new system of international relations based on the principles of respect and well-wishing non-interference.\nOn June 17-18, the first meeting of the Permanent Committee of the Antineocolonial Movement for the Freedom of Nations was held in Vladivostok, Russia.\nIn his opening remarks, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said new power centers, including the BRICS, the leaders of the African Union, ASEAN, SELAC and other integration unions of the global majority, played a key role in its context. He added that it was necessary to work toward strengthening their positions in the international institutions, primarily the UN Security Council and Group of 20, especially after the African Union\u2019s accession to the group.\nBy joining the final declaration, Russia and more than 150 representatives of leading political parties and public organizations from 32 countries, including Indonesia, emphasized their commitment to build a just and multipolar world based on the purposes and principles enshrined in the UN Charter.\nThe selective implementation of universal norms of international law and the use of unilaterally imposed illegal restrictive measures to evade the UN Charter were&nbsp;condemned.\nThe participants in the forum declared their desire to expand cooperation among the countries of the world majority in order to counter mechanisms of political and economic blackmail and restrictions on the sovereign equality of states.\nThey noted the unacceptability of imposing on the world majority certain norms in the elaboration of which the equal participation of all interested states has not been ensured, as well as the vicious system of double standards and the deliberate politicization of issues related to the observance of human rights and the development of democracy.\nVarious forms of falsification of history aimed at achieving certain geopolitical goals, attempts to consign crimes of the colonial era to oblivion as well as the deliberate dissemination by metropoles of false, untrue, misleading and socially dangerous information regarding the era of colonial conquests were denounced.\nI am convinced that the very movements that unite progressive political forces of Eurasia, Africa and Latin America can make a significant contribution to forming a fair and polycentric world order by genuine democratization of the established mechanisms of global governance, implementation of the principles of inclusive multilateralism, sovereign equality, non-interference, peaceful coexistence between countries with different political and social systems, mutual understanding and respect.\nThe aim is to build a bright future for&nbsp;the whole international community and prevent the revival of neocolonial practices.&nbsp;\n***\nThe writer is Russian ambassador to Indonesia.\n&nbsp;\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Article\nMegawati supports free meals program, with caveat\nRussia teams up with BRICS to create AI alliance\nWars, regional tensions boost arms sales: report\nIs Sritex too big to fail?\nTo remain relevant, ASEAN must address the crucial issues in its vision 2045\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nMore in Opinion\nView more\nAcademia\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo\u2019s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nPolitics\nIndonesia to pardon tens of thousands including Papua activists\nAcademia\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?\nAcademia\nStop with the LGBTQ scapegoating",

In fact, more than two-thirds of the planet\u2019s surface is covered by water, while the substance itself makes up more than half of the human body. Despite its ubiquity, only about 2.5 percent of water on earth is fresh and, like all natural resources, freshwater is finite.\nAs an archipelagic nation, Indonesia\u2019s water resources account for 6 percent of the world\u2019s and 21 percent of Asia-Pacific\u2019s resources. However, more than half of Indonesia\u2019s rivers are heavily polluted. Of those, the Indonesian National Planning Agency (Bappenas) reported that 70 percent are polluted by domestic waste.\nA Bappenas report titled\nVision 2045 Towards Water Security\nfound that achieving Indonesia\u2019s Vision 2045 requires an average annual gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate of 5.7 percent. However, the report also stated that if water-related threats remain unaddressed, GDP is likely to be 7.3 percent lower by 2045.\nWith Indonesia gearing up to host the 10th World Water Forum in Bali next year, the forum\u2019s theme of Water for Shared Prosperity, highlights the importance of an alliance between innovation, governance and finance in bringing water to all.\nSpeaking at\nThe Jakarta Post\n\u2019s JakPost UpClose 45th webinar titled Life flows on: Ensuring water security across the archipelago, Meike Kencanawulan, Settlement Infrastructure Financing director at the Public Works and Housing Ministry, highlighted the challenges in financing and climate-induced disasters, with an urgent need for increased investment in water infrastructure.\nIndonesia, facing substantial coverage gaps, struggles to meet its targets amid a mere 2 percent annual increase. Meike stressed the imperative for diverse financing mechanisms to bridge this gap by 2024.\n\"Facing the dual challenges of inadequate financing and climate disasters, our water supply efforts are strained. Insufficient funding, worsened by climate shifts, hampers progress. Despite our resolve, existing measures fall short amid population growth. Urgent, radical actions are crucial for wider coverage, vital in combating stunting and serving communities.\"\nAmid Indonesia's pursuit of enhanced water accessibility, the challenge of achieving universal clean water access remains evident. With only 30 percent of the population currently having access to piped water, the government's aim to escalate this to 100 percent presents a formidable task.\nPresident director of PT Air Bersih Jakarta L. Bano Rangkuty, through the MOYA sustainable water supply system, envisions connecting 15 million households, a leap toward this goal. His efforts align with the Government Work Plan's pivotal objective to provide piped water to 10 million households, surpassing initial expectations by over 5 million.\nThe collaborative efforts between the company, the Public Works and Housing Ministry and Jakarta-owned water operator PAM Jaya signal a harmonious approach to address the challenges, seize opportunities and strategize for a robust water supply system.\nAs Jakarta faces annual land subsidence averaging 12-18 centimeters due to excessive groundwater extraction, Bano's emphasis on sustainability processes becomes imperative. His initiatives not only meet health standards but also pave the way for the 100 percent tap water coverage target by 2030.\n\u201cWe're still very keen to assist the government in order to be able to increase the coverage in Indonesia, meaning that we are not just going to focus in Java or in Sumatra, but anywhere there's a chance together with the government to increase access to clean water,\u201d he said.\nPAM Jaya technical director Untung Suryadi noted the correlation between water supply, happiness and the company\u2019s own goal, explaining that water plays a vital role in eradicating social inequality and improving civilization.\n\u201cPiped water is the connecting link for citizens of Jakarta to a modern and quality life. At PAM Jaya, we channel water as though we are channeling happiness. Happiness that leads us to finding meaning and purposes, which is by presenting water sovereignty for all citizens of Jakarta through increasing the service coverage up to 100 percent by 2030.\u201d\nHe acknowledged the limitations, which are tackled through innovations, such as the introduction of communal reservoirs to reach low-supply areas. Strategic planning to enhance service coverage through Surface Water Supply Systems (SPAM) by 2030, they align with Indonesia's objective to increase household water distribution.\nM. Habib Abiyan Dzakwan, a researcher at the Centre for Strategic International Studies, highlighted water's interconnectedness with various sectors like mineral extraction and agriculture, advocating for collective responsibility across ministries and local governments and stressing the need to view water issues holistically.\nSaltwater intrusion is one of the main topics that he discussed. \u201cWater can be seen as a standalone issue, and we need to think about long-term issues such as saltwater intrusion. When talking about climate change, all those regions lying in the coastal areas need to think about this saltwater intrusion.\u201d\nHe advocated for a shift in domestic constituents' perception, urging them to consider water security while electing leaders. His call for a foreign policy centered on water security, especially in the Mekong region, underscores the need for international collaboration.\nThe recent drought and heat wave brought by the El Ni\u00f1o phenomenon has underlined the finiteness of water as well as its infinitely valuable status. Without collaborative efforts from all stakeholders to ensure water security, there would be no food and no life.\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Article\nSchool Holideals: Over 100 Archipelago International hotels offer up to 30% off\nAn honest conversation: How storytelling can make a positive impact on yourself and others\nThe blue transformation toward Golden Indonesia 2045\nBlue economy at center of upcoming island states summit\nWebinar on Indonesia-Korea economic partnership implementation to be held in May\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nMore in Front Row\nView more\nFront Row\nThink Business, Think Hong Kong: Spotlighting Asia opportunities in Jakarta\nFront Row\nBPJS Kesehatan partners with stakeholders to build a fraud-free JKN ecosystem\nFront Row\nFore Coffee ends the year strong with hopeful prospects and locally focused products\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo\u2019s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nPolitics\nIndonesia to pardon tens of thousands including Papua activists\nAcademia\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?\nAcademia\nStop with the LGBTQ scapegoating",

Setting apart the Global Security Initiative (GSI), which I am much wearier of, the former two could really bring positive developments, especially in the global South.\nFirst, China has undoubtedly made a lot of progress in the field of development and poverty eradication and, at the same time, certainly the whole world would be richer if more Chinese traditions and culture were disseminated.\nYet why not add one more initiative? China could launch the Global Deliberative Democracy Initiative (GDDI).\nAs I have written previously, China is not a simple authoritarian regime but rather a much more complex political system with unique political features.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nAuthoritarianism is a key element but not the only one.

The company processes nickel to produce stainless steel. ( Antara/Jojon)\nD\nespite staggering economic growth and phenomenal technological advancements since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution in the 18th century until 2019, the Western development model, capitalism, has failed to lift much of the world\u2019s population out of poverty and hunger.&nbsp;\nToday the number of the world\u2019s poor has climbed to 3 billion, extremely poor 1.5 billion and 1 billion are hungry. As of today, barely half the world\u2019s poorest have electricity, and only one in five have access to the internet.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\nWestern capitalism has also been the root cause of the widening economic inequality both within and among countries of the world.\nThe ever-increasing wealth concentration is dangerous because it threatens human progress, social cohesion, human rights and democracy. A world in which wealth is concentrated in a few hands is also a world in which military and political powers are controlled by a few and used by them for their own benefits.\nAs the wealth gap and the power gap grow, mistrust, resentment and anger inevitably deepen, pushing the world toward social upheaval and increasing the likelihood of armed conflict among nations.\nMore alarmingly is the fact that the past 270 years of economic growth have also caused massive environmental degradation that has resulted in a triple ecological crisis of environmental pollution, biodiversity loss and global warming.&nbsp;\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nFurthermore, since the first Industrial Revolution, the Earth\u2019s temperature has increased by 1.2 degrees Celsius, compared with the pre-industrial global temperature.&nbsp; If the temperature increase is higher than 1.5 degrees, then the negative impacts of global climate change such as heat waves, extreme weather, devastating droughts and wildfires, sea level rise, storms and floods, ocean acidification, declining food production and disease outbreaks will be unmanageable.\nThe existential challenge for mankind in the 21st century is then how to produce food, clothing, housing, pharmaceutical products, minerals, water, energy and other resources to meet the ever-increasing human demand; and at the same time resolve the triple ecological crisis. Another existential challenge is how to generate global economic growth to provide enough jobs for the ever-growing labor force in an inclusive, environmentally friendly and sustainable way.&nbsp;\nAt this juncture, China\u2019s development paradigm based upon four pillars; cooperation, harmony, peace and development, with its vision of \u201ca shared peace and prosperity for the world\u201d could be an alternative model for building a better, inclusive, peaceful, prosperous and sustainable world.&nbsp;\nBy adopting these four pillars, in the last four decades China has passed on the successes and benefits of its development and modernization to the world through the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative and the Global Civilization Initiative, which are considered public goods offered by the Chinese nation to the global community.\nChina\u2019s rapid economic growth, and long-term social stability and prosperity have been widely viewed as a miracle in the history of human development. Over the past 100 years or so, the Chinese nation has transformed itself from being impoverished and backward into the world\u2019s second-largest economy, the top trader in goods, the biggest holder of foreign exchange reserves and the biggest manufacturer.&nbsp;\nChina has put in place the world\u2019s largest compulsory education system, social security system and medical and health system, achieving in just a few decades industrialization that took developed countries several centuries to realize.\nChina has inspired many developing countries to seek their own model to develop their economy; master and apply science, technology and innovations; reduce poverty; and transform into developed, prosperous and sovereign nations.&nbsp;\nWhen visiting Kazakhstan and Indonesia in September and October 2013, Chinese President Xi Jinping declared the initiative of jointly developing the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road, hereinafter referred to as the BRI.&nbsp;\nThe BRI originated in China, but it belongs to the world. It focuses on Asia, Europe and Africa, but is also open to all partners. It spans different countries and regions, different cultures and religions, and different customs and lifestyles.\nUnder the BRI, all participating nations are galvanized under the common goal of seeking mutually beneficial and sustainable socio-economic transformative partnerships. By the end of March 2019, the Chinese government had signed 173 cooperation agreements with 125 countries and 29 international organizations.&nbsp;\nSince the inception of BRI in 2013, more than 3,000 cooperation projects have been launched, involving about US$1 trillion in investment and creating 420,000 jobs in participating countries.\nCooperation between Indonesia and China has dramatically increased in almost all aspects of human and economic development since the Reform Era and the administration of late president Abdurrahman Wahid in 1999. In the last two decades, China has been the most important partner for Indonesia, particularly in economic development, investment and trade.&nbsp;\nUnder the auspices of China\u2019s BRI and Indonesia\u2019s World Maritime Fulcrum, our two beloved nations have developed mutual cooperation in infrastructure, for example ports, roads, the Jakarta-Bandung high-speed railway; mining and energy including renewable and clean energy (electric vehicles); manufacturing industry; digital technology and connectivity; maritime (blue) economy; tourism and creative economy; research and development; and education and training.\nTherefore, I am strongly confident that the initiative of \u201cTwo Countries, Twin Parks\u201d (TCTP) between China and Indonesia, which basically covers a joint development of industrial estates in China and Indonesia, will strengthen and enhance maritime connectivity between the two countries, boost investment and trade, and deepen and enhance people-to-people interaction and cooperation. The partnership will also benefit the rest of the world.\nIndustrial areas in China focus on the Fuzhou Yuanhong Investment Zone with a total area of 60 square kilometers. Meanwhile, in Indonesia there are three industrial zones: Bintan Industrial Estate, Aviarna Industrial Estate and Batang Industrial Park, which cover 87.6 sq. km combined.\nIndonesia and Fujian province have five sister provinces and cities, such as Fujian province and Central Java; Fuzhou and Semarang; Xiamen and Surabaya; Zhangzhou and Palembang; and Fuqing and Malang.\nLast January, the Chinese State Council approved the development of the China-Indonesia Exposition Zone based on the TCTP to boost inclusive and sustainable economic growth in both countries by capitalizing on science and technological innovations originating in Fuzhou. China\u2019s Ministry of Trade has included the TCTP China-Indonesia in the Chinese 14th Five-Year Development Plan. Furthermore, the Chinese National Development and Reform Commission has considered the China-Indonesia TCTP as one the most important backbones of cooperation under the auspices of the 21st Maritime Silk Road.\nChina, the world\u2019s most populous country and second-largest economy, and Indonesia, the fourth most populous nation and the 16th biggest economy, will play a role model of mutual cooperation for the global community if they succeed in implementing their win-win partnership deal while working together to achieve United Nations sustainable development goals.\n&nbsp;***\nThe writer is a professor of fisheries and marine sciences at Bogor Agricultural University (IPB University), and a member of International Scientific Advisory Board of Center for Sustainable Coastal and Ocean Development, University of Bremen, Germany.

Facing a tumultuous world, Indonesia maintains vigilance, practices prudence and commits to regional peace, stability and prosperity without being dragged into a geopolitical competition.\nChina and Indonesia enjoy a long-standing friendship, and our relations took on a high-speed train last year. Last July, President Joko \u201cJokowi\u201d Widodo visited China, as the first foreign head of state after the Beijing Winter Olympics. Last November, President Xi Jinping visited Indonesia, his first foreign visit after the 20th Congress of the ruling party of China. The two leaders reached an important consensus on building a China-Indonesia community with a shared future and reaffirmed the commitment to firmly support each other on issues of core interests concerning national sovereignty, security and territorial integrity, showing the strength of our bilateral ties.\nThis year marks the 10th anniversary of the comprehensive strategic partnership between China and Indonesia. China will further follow the consensus reached by the two leaders, implement the Five-Year Action Plan, conduct high-level four-pillar cooperation covering politics, economy, people-to-people exchanges and maritime projects, and work more on such new flagship programs as the Regional Comprehensive Economic Corridor and green industrial parks.\nThis January, Indonesia approved the implementation of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP). China supports setting up an RCEP secretariat at an early date and upgrading it at a proper time. China has applied to join the CPTPP and Digital Economy Partnership Agreement (DEPA). We stand ready to conclude high-standard free trade agreements with more countries and strengthen digital connectivity.\nChinese modernization features peaceful development. President Xi proposed the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative and the Global Civilization Initiative, which called for shared values of peace, development, equity, justice, democracy and freedom, and urged the seeking of common development, collective security and mutual learning between civilizations.\nAs a major developing country, an emerging economy with the world\u2019s largest Muslim population, Indonesia is to realize the grand Indonesian Vision 2045. Hence, in this turbulent world, we support each other for win-win cooperation, a blessing for our two countries and the whole region.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nIndonesia is this year\u2019s rotating president of ASEAN. President Jokowi pointed out that Indonesia would maintain ASEAN centrality and unity, regional peace and political stability, and emphasized that ASEAN should not be a proxy of any party and should prevent regional competition from becoming conflict.\nHe committed to promoting the economy by hosting the flagship Asia-Pacific Forum, exploring cooperation in the creative and digital economy, commercial investment and infrastructure, to make ASEAN a powerhouse of regional growth, which is highly acclaimed by the international community.\nOver the past decade, under the guidance of President Xi and leaders of ASEAN members, China-ASEAN relations have gotten on a fast track. China was the first to establish a strategic partnership and start free trade agreement negotiations with ASEAN, to express its support for the centrality of ASEAN in regional cooperation and its willingness to sign the Treaty on the Southeast Asian Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone.\nFriends from ASEAN have told me that the China-ASEAN partnership is the most vigorous and fruitful among its peers. Today, we are each other\u2019s largest trading partner, with bilateral trade up 100-fold compared with 30 years ago. The accumulative amount of our bilateral direct investment exceeds US$310 billion.\nLast year, China and ASEAN established a comprehensive strategic partnership. The two sides have deepened cooperation in green development, climate change, environmental protection, energy transition and the digital economy, and have worked together in implementing the Global Development Initiative and UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and in addressing risks to public health, food security, energy security and the financial sector.\nTen years ago, the ASEAN Summit started the RCEP negotiations. Today, the RCEP comes into force in 14 countries, forming the largest free trade area. The past decade reflects the essence of the China-ASEAN relationship, that is, we are good neighbors and close partners sharing weal and woe.\nChina firmly supports ASEAN as a driver of regional cooperation and appreciates Indonesia\u2019s emphasis that the ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific is neither attached to nor targeted at any party. We will step up support for ASEAN integration and welcome ASEAN to formulate its post-2025 Community Vision.\nAs a valuable treasure, the ASEAN model embodies the oriental philosophy of how countries properly handle differences and disagreements. In the 1950s, the five principles of peaceful coexistence, initiated by China and Indonesia, ensured that countries, big or small, strong or weak, are entitled to peace.\nIn the past 50 years, regional countries have explored an ASEAN model based on the principles of mutual respect, consultation and accommodating the comfort levels of all parties. Positive thinking on common, cooperative and comprehensive security has been fostered, laying a solid foundation for stability in Asia.\nAt present, globalization faces headwinds, and voices for decoupling are growing louder. We should uphold true regional cooperation that unites countries within the region and remains open to those outside, and reject the fake one that keeps certain countries out and targets certain sides. We appreciate diversity among members, develop networks of friends worldwide with an open mindset, and reject any attempt to split the region into confrontational or exclusive groups.\nWe will advance negotiations on the new round of the China-ASEAN FTA upgrade, pursue synergies between Hainan Free Trade Port, Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area and ASEAN development strategies, and support Hong Kong and Macao in more extensive cooperation with ASEAN members.\nThis year marks the 10th anniversary of the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road. Over the decade, the synergies between the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and Indonesia\u2019s global maritime fulcrum have borne remarkable fruits. The Jakarta-Bandung High-Speed Railway has finished a successful trial operation. Notable progress has been made in the \u201ctwo countries, twin parks\u201d program. Our cooperation in the digital economy, green development and maritime projects has many highlights.\nChina has actively supported upgrading Indonesian industries. Our vaccine cooperation has grown from donation to coproduction and tech transfer. With China\u2019s support, Indonesia became the first country in Southeast Asia to master the mRNA vaccine production tech.\nAt Indonesia Morowali Industrial Park (IMIP), one Chinese tech professional teaches know-how to five to 10 Indonesian employees. Currently, the IMIP has created nearly 80,000 local jobs and paid $2.4 billion in tax to the Indonesian government.\nChinese enterprises actively fulfill their social responsibilities. Over 10,000 projects invested in by Chinese enterprises have created 250,000 local jobs. Some 91 percent of the Chinese-invested enterprises help local employees master skills through tech transfer, and 50 percent send Indonesian employees to China to receive training.\nThis year, China will hold the Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation. We welcome Indonesia in jointly building the New International Land-Sea Trade Corridor to facilitate trade within the region. We are willing to import more quality goods from Indonesia and encourage more Chinese enterprises to invest here.\nWe are ready to strengthen cooperation in a low-carbon, circular and green economy. We stand ready to explore maritime economic cooperation, for example, marine products processing, tech support, environmental protection and port construction. And we are willing to advance synergies between the BRI, the Global Development Initiative and Indo-Pacific Outlook, to contribute more to regional poverty reduction and people-to-people ties.\n&nbsp;***\nThe writer is the deputy director general of the China Center for Contemporary World Studies (CCCWS).

Global warming has caused sea temperatures to rise and melt polar ice caps. As a result, the volume of seawater increases to eventually submerge land.\nLife as we know it, including all living creatures as well as human civilization and culture, will disappear instantly. This is one of the worst possible impacts of climate change.\nClimate change has had substantial negative impacts on ecosystems, infrastructure and the health and livelihoods of people around the world. At the Conference of the Parties (COP) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the issue of loss and damage (L&amp;D), such as to ecosystems and infrastructure, is a priority for many vulnerable countries because of the severe climate change impacts they are experiencing. For many small island states, these impacts pose an existential threat.\nWhat we need to understand is that the impacts of climate change are permanent, meaning that they are irrecoverable and so there is no going back to the way things were.\nAccording to a 2022 report by the UN Environmental Program (UNEP), almost half of all natural disasters on Earth are climate disasters: The devastating wildfires of 2022 in the United States and Canada were the result of a long heat wave in the northern hemisphere; years of drought threaten Africa with widespread famine; and flash floods in Pakistan have affected 30 million people.\nOver the past 50 years, climate-related disasters around the world have killed an average of 115 people per day, with more than 91 percent of the deaths occurring in developing countries. The current level of global L&amp;D is actually difficult to calculate, but it is estimated to be no less than US$200 million each day. From 1970 to 2019, more than 11,000 climate disasters occurred, leading to more than 2 million deaths and $3.64 trillion in financial losses.\nIn Indonesia, more than 90 percent of disasters, including floods and landslides, are meteorological disasters linked to the climate crisis. A study by the National Development Planning Agency (Bappenas) shows that Indonesia may suffer Rp 544 trillion ($36 billion) in potential economic losses in 2020-2024 due to the climate crisis. Around 80 percent of losses are incurred by coastal and coastal damage, and the rest due to declines in agricultural production (rice), health and clean water supply.\nLoss and damage has been discussed since the 1991 UN climate change negotiations. At that meeting, Vanuatu, representing the members of the Association of Small Island Countries (AOSIS), proposed the establishment of an insurance scheme for countries that could potentially be submerged due to rising sea levels caused by global warming and climate change.\nAccording to AOSIS, global negotiations on L&amp;D have not been \"fair\" enough. The Maldives, for example, contributes only 0.03 percent of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, but sea level rise is a real threat to the country, as four-fifths of its islands are only 1 meter above sea level.\nSimilarly, the entire continent of Africa contributes only 3.8 percent to global GHG emissions, yet the continent is the most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change and has long endured severe loss and damage.\nPoliticians and civil society stakeholders in several developing countries have highlighted the responsibility of developed countries in causing climate change, and have called on them to compensate for the losses and damages incurred to developing countries.\nThe L&amp;D issue gained momentum in 2013 when the UNFCCC parties agreed to establish the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage associated with Climate Change Impacts (WIM).\nThe mechanism is intended to facilitate dialogue, fill knowledge gaps and enhance action and support for countries experiencing loss and damage.\nAt COP25 in Madrid in 2019, the parties agreed to establish the Santiago Network for Loss and Damage to act as a bridge between developing countries, developed countries and international agencies providing development aid and loans. At COP26 in Glasgow in 2021, L&amp;D received a considerable amount of attention.\nThe final Glasgow Climate Pact included a specific section on L&amp;D and urged developed countries and international aid agencies to provide more assistance for L&amp;D-related activities. The parties agreed to hold a the Glasgow Dialogue, set to run until June 2024, to discuss arrangements for funding activities to prevent, minimize and address loss and damage associated with the adverse impacts of climate change.\nThe parties only recently realized the importance of immediately and collectively addressing the issue, at COP27 in Sharm el-Sheikh last December, where they finally agreed to an L&amp;D funding mechanism due to the recent escalation of climate disasters in various parts of the world.\nCOP27 marked a historical moment when the parties agreed to create an L&amp;D funding mechanism, something that climate-vulnerable developing countries had been working toward for decades, despite the lack of support from developed countries.\nHowever, it is yet to be decided where the fund will be placed, within or without the UNFCCC framework, what types of activities it will support, how it will be managed, which countries will be eligible to receive it, and who will contribute financially.\nAt COP27, the parties agreed to establish a \u201ctransition committee\u201d to take a more in-depth look at this issue and make recommendations for consideration at COP28 in Abu Dhabi in November-December this year.\nThe Indonesian government should capitalize on this funding opportunity by reviewing its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) commitments to focus more on mitigation efforts. L&amp;D funding should serve as a buffer when mitigation efforts are constrained by uncertain global dynamics.\nThe ministries and state agencies that deal with L&amp;D-related activities, such as Bappenas, the Forestry and Environment Ministry, the Finance Ministry and the Public Works and Housing Ministry, should take the initiative to initiate this effort.\nA transparent and participatory L&amp;D dialogue involving state and non-state actors needs to be held immediately, especially in those coastal areas where more than 50 million people live that have been identified as vulnerable (Bappenas, 2021). This includes other areas that are vulnerable due to disrupted hydrological cycles leading to floods and landslides. L&amp;D governance and institutionalization at the national level should lead to technical interventions to solve problems at the local level.\nIn addition, it is necessary to identify politically realistic steps that can be taken in the short, medium and long terms toward building a shared vision by involving all stakeholders, including people with disabilities, the group most vulnerable to the impacts of L&amp;D. The 2024 general election must also show serious attention to the issue of loss and damage, as it will be an important agenda for whoever is elected.\nAn adaptive strategy needs to be created and developed collectively to deal with the impacts of climate disasters, which are expected to increase in the coming years.\n***\nRachmat Witoelar is a former environment minister (2004-2009) and the president of COP13 in Bali (2007).

Through modernization, China is working to bridge the gap between regions, urban and rural areas and income distribution, and to distribute fairer-development results to benefit all people.\nIt is the modernization for material and cultural-ethical advancement. While continuing to consolidate the material foundation for modernization and improve the material conditions for people\u2019s well-being, we will strive to develop advanced-socialist culture and thus promote all-around material abundance as well as people\u2019s well-rounded development.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nIt is the modernization of harmony between humanity and nature. China is committed to sustainable development, pursuing a model of sound development featuring improved production, higher living standards and healthy ecosystems.\nIt is the modernization of peaceful development. Dedicated to peace, development, cooperation and mutual benefit, we will strive to safeguard world peace and development as we pursue our own development, and we will make greater contributions to world peace and development through our own development.\nHarmony between humanity and nature is a basic requirement of Chinese modernization. The report of the national congress has emphasized that respecting, adapting to and protecting nature is essential for building China into a modern socialist country in all respects. It is necessary to firmly establish and practice the principle that lucid waters and lush mountains are invaluable assets and maintain harmony between humanity and nature when planning our development.\nIn the first decade of the new era, under the guidance of Xi Jinping's thought on ecological civilization, China has ensured stronger ecological conservation and environmental protection across the board, in all regions and at all times.\nIn the land of China today, the harmony of all things is turning from a blueprint into a reality. The \u201cendangered\u201d giant panda has been downgraded to \"vulnerable\". Crested ibis, the auspicious bird, has initially escaped the urgent risk of extinction. And there has appeared again the shocking scene of Tibetan-antelope migration on the Qinghai-Tibet plateau.\nChina will continue to advance the Beautiful China Initiative. We will persist with a holistic and systematic approach to conserving and improving mountain, water, forest, farmland, grassland and desert ecosystems. We will accelerate the transition to a model of green development; intensify pollution prevention and control; enhance diversity, stability and sustainability in our ecosystems; and work actively and prudently toward the goals of achieving peak-carbon emissions and carbon neutrality.\nThe grand blueprint of Chinese modernization also creates new opportunities for global ecological governance.\nOn Dec. 20, Part II of the 15\nth\nMeeting of the Conference of the Parties to The Convention on Biological Diversity (COP15), under the leadership and promotion of China, the president of the conference, a new 10-year blueprint for biodiversity conservation was launched, and the highly anticipated Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework was adopted.\nPresident Xi addressed an important speech, proposing China's plan to advance global-biodiversity conservation and to continuously strengthen the construction of ecological civilization.\nOver the years, China's green development has made important contributions to global-ecological governance. China has taken a series of practical actions to work actively and prudently toward the goals of reaching peak-carbon emissions and carbon neutrality, which has achieved important results.\nChina has kept increasing investment in the field of clean energy. It has expanded our vegetation coverage to about 25 percent of the world\u2019s total in the recent 20 years, ranking first in the world. And China has also carried out extensive cooperation with many countries on green development.\nIndonesia, too, regards the green-economy index as one of its development goals, and incorporates it into its medium and long-term planning. Indonesia has also set the targets for emission reduction and net-zero emission by 2060 or sooner. The Group of 20 Bali Leaders\u2019 Declaration adopted in November also proposes to realize the vision of living in harmony with nature.\nBalinese traditional philosophy also attaches great importance to the harmony between humanity and the environment. The World Heritage Site Bali Subak Irrigation System, which practices Tri Hita Karana philosophy, embodies harmony between the realm of spirit, the human world and nature.\nAs an old Chinese saying goes, \u201cAll living things should flourish without harming each other; all ways of life should thrive without hindering each other.\u201d It is expected that China and Indonesia will continue to strengthen cooperation and work together to open a new chapter in building a community of all life on Earth and create a bright future of harmonious co-existence between man and Nature.\n&nbsp;***\nThe writer is consul general of People\u2019s Republic of China in Denpasar, Bali.\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Article\nIndonesia must regain credibility as an honest broker\nBiden pushes new Russia, Iran, Korea, China effort before Trump term\nWhy a UN plastics treaty matters for climate change and Indonesia\nPreventing food security agenda from exacerbating climate crisis\nPrabowo\u2019s defense modernization: Ambition or balance of power?\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nMore in Opinion\nView more\nAcademia\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo\u2019s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nPolitics\nIndonesia to pardon tens of thousands including Papua activists\nAcademia\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?\nAcademia\nStop with the LGBTQ scapegoating",

In the 1950s and 1960s, the two were the key members of the global movement that later became known as the Non-Aligned Movement.\nA few weeks ago, the two countries were again in the global spotlight. They hosted global meetings that could hopefully reverberate for years to come and transform climate commitments into real action.\nIndonesia recently hosted the Group of 20 Summit in Bali with global climate action as one of the key commitments in the G20 Leaders\u2019 Statement. Meanwhile, in parallel, Egypt hosted the United Nations climate summit (COP27) in Sharm el-Sheikh.\nThese two summits appear to echo concerns over future global risks presented by the\n2022 Global Risk Report\nby the World Economic Forum. That is, the very top risk threating our civilization in the next decade, according to the report, is that we are not taking enough action to address climate issues.\n&nbsp;\nProgress from COP27, G20 Summit\nWhile some may be disappointed by the outcomes of COP27, we can celebrate certain positive results. The first is the loss and damage fund. One good outcome of COP27 is that the attending countries finally agreed on a dedicated fund to address damages from climate change, and this should be settled before COP28.\nAnother important piece of progress from COP27 is regarding blended finance. At COP27, there were calls for more active measures by multilateral development institutions such as the World Bank and Asia Development Bank. Out of climate investment funds, Indonesia was offered a new financing deal worth US$1 billion in concessional loans and grants to fund the transition away from coal to clean energy.\nIn parallel, at the G20 Summit, we also heard about a sustainable agenda spanning sectoral issues \u2013 agriculture, energy, industry \u2013 to development and growth strategies. At the summit, United States President Joe Biden and President Joko \u201cJokowi\u201d Widodo announced a massive climate financing deal, worth $20 billion, under the Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP).\nAn interesting feature of the deal is that the JETP is perhaps the largest ever instance of blended finance aimed at supporting transition. The commitment of $20 billion was split between government dollars and private finance. The private sector financing \u2013 likely taking the form of debt and equity \u2013 will come from contributions of the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero group of banks and asset managers.&nbsp;\nMeanwhile, the details of the deal will be discussed further. Some have said that financing deals would be acceptable as long as the rates were competitive.\n&nbsp;\nOpportunities in net-zero transition\nAs Indonesia has become&nbsp;more ambitious in its commitments, will they&nbsp;bind us in difficult situations in the transition?\nIndonesia recently&nbsp;submitted its enhanced nationally determined contribution (NDC) to the UN with an emissions reduction target that had increased from 29 percent in the first NDC and updated NDC to 31.89 percent unconditionally, as well as from 41 percent conditionally in the updated NDC to 43.20 percent conditionally. Indonesia is now more ambitious, and it will not be easy to walk the talk.\nHowever, we may not be aware that Indonesia has actually undergone significant transformations in transition pathways. And this is the right way to be more ambitious.\nThere have been initiatives and pipeline projects among the private sector in renewable energy projects. Indonesia has indeed hid untapped opportunities in the green economy.\nFirst, Indonesia\u2019s nature-based solutions to emissions offer huge opportunities. Indonesia\u2019s land and oceans are forms of natural \u201ccarbon sinks\u201d that absorb more than half of all greenhouse gas emissions. Indonesia\u2019s tropical forest accounts for 10 percent of global tropical forest. Indonesia\u2019s mangrove forest cover is among the largest in the world, consisting of 23 percent of global mangrove forests. These nature-based solutions will position Indonesia at a strong advantage in the green economy.\nWith regard to industry, Indonesia could tap opportunities to become a global battery manufacturing hub. Rising sales of global electric vehicles will drive substantial growth in demand for lithium ion batteries over the next three decades. With about a quarter of all nickel reserves globally, Indonesia could become a critical part of the global electric vehicle battery supply chain.\nA recent report by the Bloomberg New Energy Forum (BNEF) suggested that Indonesia\u2019s transition would open investment opportunities worth of $2 trillion to $3.5 trillion over the next three decades. The biggest driver of this investment would come from the power sector. This benefit does not account yet for potential green jobs created during the transition. &nbsp;\n&nbsp;\nChallenges ahead\nNow, the critical part is the support of the financial industry. So far, Indonesia\u2019s financial sector has been moving forward. Since 2012, there have been various milestones and advancements from the sustainable finance road map to the green taxonomy announced by the Financial Services Authority (OJK). There are supporting regulations as well as OJK Regulation No. 51/2017 on sustainable finance and carbon pricing regulations.\nPlayers from the financial industry and other parts of the private sector certainly welcome these regulations. However, there are also need to be more advancements for the regulations to be workable. This is when challenges surface.\nResearch conducted by Mandiri Institute shows that various government strategies and road maps toward a low-carbon economy may risk causing confusion. For example, various decarbonization pathways released by the government often result in different emission targets. This may create confusion in the private sector and thus prevent it from taking consistent steps toward decarbonization.\nOn sustainable investing, environment, social, governance (ESG) investment products \u2013 as a proxy for the resources allocated toward sustainability projects \u2013 suffer from a lack of product differentiation. This could be attributed to poor understanding of sustainable investing. We find that around 61 percent of fund managers surveyed view understanding ESG as a challenge. Another possible explanation is that a lack of ESG data appears to be almost universal across all fund managers.\n&nbsp;\nWhat to do next\nTo address challenges related to various road maps, we need to align these targets. This will provide clear guidance to market participants and help focus efforts on the most important steps to enable Indonesia\u2019s net-zero future.\nOn the financing side, it is also expected that there are clear guidelines and specific incentives that align with global best practices on frameworks, reporting and other standards of sustainable finance practice. This would encourage \u201caffordable\u201d green financing or sustainability-linked initiatives from financial institutions.\nDeveloping awareness programs to improve our understanding of sustainable investing is also important. The sustainable finance road maps were intended to increase awareness. However, we need initiatives beyond these programs.\nTo attract green investment, we may need to undertake regulatory and market reforms. This could meet the needs of investors\u2019 interest in renewable energy and green projects. Lastly, we need to ensure that the decarbonization pathway takes the just transition aspects into account. Speeding up the adoption of a carbon emission trading system to optimize revenue and finance the transition could be an option.\nIndonesia is now at a crossroads in transforming its economy into a greener and more sustainable form. With huge opportunities, we need to act swiftly to tap into these potentials.\n*****\n\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\nThe writer is head of the Mandiri Institute\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Article\nMegawati supports free meals program, with caveat\nProtecting our archipelago from illegal fishing\nLula 'stable' after emergency surgery\nG20 Brazil: Lessons for an effective cooperation platform\nPrabowo mulls extending tour to Middle East\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nMore in Paper\nView more\nOpinion\nAnalysis: Govt adopts mandatory B35 biodiesel program as CPO prices tumble\nBusiness\nGlobal chip crunch stunts Indonesia car sales recovery\nBusiness\nXL profit falls in Q3 as tower sale income dries\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo\u2019s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nPolitics\nIndonesia to pardon tens of thousands including Papua activists\nAcademia\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?\nAcademia\nStop with the LGBTQ scapegoating",

(AFP/Peter Parks)\nL\nast week, I learned from Jarno Habicht, WHO\u2019s Ukraine representative, as he was receiving fresh health supplies to a warehouse in Lviv and he spoke about the high cost the Russian invasion is having on Ukrainian people, the damage caused to hospitals and the mental and physical impact the war is having on health workers and the civilian population.\nBut tragically, Ukraine is not the only emergency the world is currently facing. In Afghanistan, people are selling even their kidneys and children to survive. In Tigray, one of the longest and worst blockades in history has largely shut off deliveries of food, fuel and medicines and the region is facing a humanitarian calamity, which includes mass starvation.\nA worsening climate crisis is leading to countries getting hit by multiple climatic catastrophes simultaneously. In the same week last month, Australia\u2019s coral reefs bleached as other parts of the country dealt with \u201ccataclysmic floods\u201d.\nAnd the pandemic persists with record cases and deaths being recorded in some Asian countries and intense transmission of Omicron (variant BA.1 followed by BA.2) around the world continuing to put substantial pressure on health systems.\nRising conflict, the worsening climate situation and prolonged pandemic collectively have led to the Doomsday Clock to become stuck at 100 seconds to midnight, which remains the closest the world has ever been to a civilization-ending apocalypse since its creation in 1947. It\u2019s easy to feel despair but there are things we can do at the micro and macro levels to make a difference.\nTo prevent the current multidimensional crises from turning into a humanity death spiral, there needs to be concerted and creative efforts to bend the arc of history towards a solutions orientated, healthier and sustainable world. The vast majority of the world wants to live in a world free of war, where they and their families can access good work, put food on the table and have access to essential health services and quality schooling.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nWhile it is relatively easy to kick off a conflict, the search for peace is often somewhat elusive as wars have a habit of spiraling and leading to unforeseen escalations and negative consequences. Peace underpins all that is good in our societies. We need peace for health and likewise health for peace. For health workers, WHO staff and for our humanitarian partners on the ground, war makes everything exponentially harder and sometimes even impossible.\nRecognizing that peace is foundational to all our work on health, development and tackling the challenges of conflict, the climate crisis and COVID-19, I am today announcing a new \u201cPeace for Health and Health for Peace\u201d global initiative as we mark the World Health Day. It aims first and foremost to foster new dialogue around health and peace.\nFor example, the creation of humanitarian corridors so that people can access basics, including nutritious food, fuel and health services, and that no health care facilities be targeted militarily, which is a disturbing new trend seen in conflict. I will be asking other UN agencies, civil society, sport organizations, academia and business, to get behind this initiative, which I ultimately envisage will be part of an overall peace building effort that helps the people that are at highest risk of disease and death.&nbsp;\nThe\nhighly progressive Millennium Declaration\n\u2013 developed at the turn of the century \u2013 outlined the nexus between peace, security, development and health. War has relegated our struggles against a heating world and the COVID-19 pandemic onto something of the back burner but both of these need international cooperation to move forward.\nAnd even in a highly divided world, progress is possible. For example, at the height of the Cold War, the United States and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics both worked together to achieve smallpox eradication, which remains one of the great scientific achievements of our time and provides lessons to the other existential challenges of our time.\nWhile war currently dominates the attention of decision makers and the media, the pandemic is by no means over. WHO recognizes the ongoing threat of COVID-19 and is working with countries to both track the virus and ensure that all opportunities to boost the immunity of populations are taken. The North Star goal of vaccinating 70 percent of the population is eminently doable and I\u2019m pleased to see countries including Vietnam, Pakistan and Nigeria reflect that progress is possible if resources and efforts are effectively targeted.\nSimultaneously, it is important to strengthen health systems, so countries can catch up on the many health issues that have seen progress backslide, while also preparing them for future variants of concerns and potential new pandemics. While rich countries are rolling out \u201csecond boosters\u201d \u2013 fourth doses effectively \u2013 it is incompetent and/or negligent that a few groups in those same countries are suggesting that vaccinating to similar standards is not worth it. After all, the pandemic and the resulting challenges related to supply chain chaos, remain a threat to not just health but peace and security.\nSimilarly, the climate crisis probably remains the largest and most complex existential challenge of our time that needs unparalleled action. A heating world in general is bad for health, with seven million people dying every year just in connection with air pollution.\nThis week, WHO released updated air pollution guidance, which highlights that more than 110 countries are now monitoring the air their citizens\u2019 breath. It\u2019s a good sign that countries are investing in this technology but the amount of pollutants in the air reveals the need for a transformative move away from fossil fuels, which for humanities survival must remain in the ground. With exponentially increasing fuel prices, leaders have a perfect opportunity to move rapidly toward renewable energy.\nThere are lessons from the pandemic on how scientific innovation can save lives and protect health systems but only if everyone has access. This is pertinent for the climate space because it\u2019s important to make plans now so that game changing technology and know-how are shared effectively to help avert global calamity.\nConflict, the climate crisis and COVID-19 are all contributing to huge spikes in food and fuel prices, as well as inflation, which for many keep health out of reach. In the Horn of Africa and parts of the Sahel, famine is even potentially on the horizon. As part of any peace initiative, it is critical that ensuring access to quality and nutritious food is also a basic requirement, alongside other basic amenities like health and education.\nWhatever the crisis, I\u2019m proud that WHO is always on the frontlines fighting to save lives and work toward health for all for everyone, everywhere.&nbsp;\n&nbsp;***\nThe writer is director general of the World Health Organization.\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Article\nGlobal wine output to hit lowest level since 1961\nMultilateral system in crisis\nUnderstanding diabetes and its impact on public health in Indonesia\nNobel Peace Prize to be awarded as wars rage\nIndonesia tightens mpox surveillance following three new suspected cases in Jakarta\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nMore in Opinion\nView more\nAcademia\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo\u2019s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nPolitics\nIndonesia to pardon tens of thousands including Papua activists\nAcademia\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?\nAcademia\nStop with the LGBTQ scapegoating",

The official handover will take place at the G20 Summit in Rome on 0ct. 30-31.\nPresident Joko \u201cJokowi\u201d Widodo has chosen the bold theme \u201crecover stronger, recover together\u201d. The theme sets out the vision that no one is left behind and that the recovery from the pandemic-induced economic crisis is not a contest.\nThe G20 is a multilateral forum that consists of 19 countries and the European Union. It represents 80 percent of the global gross domestic product (GDP), 75 percent of global trade and about two-thirds of the world\u2019s population. Membership is exclusive, but it includes the perspective from advanced as well as emerging countries. Hence, the G20 presidency is a strategic opportunity that puts a spotlight on the nation.\nTo hold the torch of the G20 presidency amid the ongoing pandemic brings both opportunities and challenges. The COVID-19 pandemic has induced hardships in almost all countries. The invisible enemy attacks all low-, middle- and high-income countries.\nAt the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, most countries seemed to implement inward-looking policies, and arguably are still doing so. The rationale is to grant adequate protection for their domestic economies. But the truth is that the world is in this together. Domestic economic recovery will not be optimal if many countries are still unable to recover.\nAll countries around the globe need support from each other. That necessity makes economic diplomacy a strategic policy instrument in the effort to recover. Amid the ongoing economic recovery, solidarity should underlie the benign international perspective (outward) back to equilibrium.\nMost international cooperation efforts, however, fall prey to the basic macro problem, i.e., the recursive collective action problem. Robert Hockett of Cornell Law School depicts the recursive collective action problem as a natural force of individual rationality, which recursively yields to a suboptimal outcome at the macro level. To take his notion seriously, one should think of advancing the scope toward the ultimate magnitude of civilization, i.e., the global sphere.\nTo realize that we are constantly dealing with so-called global macro collectivity summons, we must acknowledge that international leadership is challenging. The rationality of an individual nation naturally prompts a conflict of interests at the global level. Global leadership hence requires more than the \u201clead by example\u201d notion. The fundamental value should be global collectivity. It might be a tough row to hoe, but not impossible with a decent formula. One nation\u2019s aggressive domination should be cleared out of the equation.\nBreaking down the theme for Indonesia's 2022 G20 presidency, we shall see two coherent dimensions of a great international leadership vision. The first reflects such togetherness and collectivity, which is highly relevant with\ngotong royong\n(mutual cooperation) as a fundamental value of Indonesia. The second shows bold optimism to build a stronger post-pandemic economic base. Both dimensions are suitable to fuel the global solidarity spirit to weather any challenges and move toward a brighter global future.\nThe pandemic has indeed served as a strong reminder of the prominence of solidarity and collectivity in the global economic constellation. Strategic agendas such as climate change, sovereign debt sustainability, digital economic and financial trends, and the enhancement of sustainable global financial architecture should be taken seriously. Indonesia through the 2022 presidency must be able to offer strategic initiatives and to convince the G20 members to act communally.\nLegally, Indonesia's G20 presidency can be seen as the implementation of the constitutional mandate in the preamble to the 1945 Constitution, i.e., to participate in the establishment of a world order, which in the social aspect includes the economic pillar.\nStrategic diplomacy should not only cover the interest of domestic economic growth but also ensure a global arrangement that is conducive to more sustainable growth. That means the task must be carried further. Indonesia must bear in mind that the benefit of G20 initiatives stemming from the 2022 G20 presidency should not only be for the exclusive members of the G20, but also for the rest of the world as the strategic ongoing concern.\nSpeaking about economic diplomacy, Indonesia is on the right track. Pandemic challenges cannot constrain innovations toward progress. We can see the expansion of local currency settlement (LCS) framework initiatives by Bank Indonesia for cross-border transactions. As of today, Indonesia holds strategic relationships with Malaysia, Thailand, Japan and China for LCS.\nIn addition, the international financial safety net framework has been ample to deal with the pandemic's impact on the financial sector. It can be seen from the vast array of liquidity backstop facilities, such as the Federal Reserve repo line.\nIndonesia's current macro condition in many ways is also bracing for the 2022 G20 presidency. Some numbers are even breaking the roof amid the ongoing economic recovery. The trade balance that represents Indonesia\u2019s external resilience hit US$4.47 billion in August, the highest since December 2006.\nThe new record is also manifested in the official foreign reserves. At the end of August 2021, Indonesia\u2019s foreign reserves were recorded $144.8 billion, successfully exceeding the previous record of $138.8 billion in both February and April this year.\nThe G20 presidency is a tremendous opportunity to show the world that Indonesia is worth being considered to lead the global recovery. Thus, we should proactively assemble a positive international perspective of the nation\u2019s potential. Indonesia must bring the spirit of global collectivity that would lead to better immunity of the global economy.\nIt is time to move beyond the concern of what the world could give to us and to convey what Indonesia can give to the world. Together we can.\n&nbsp;***\nThe writer is a legal advisor at Bank Indonesia (BI).

(Shutterstock/MattiaATH)\nC\nhina and Indonesia\u2019s 70th anniversary of diplomatic relations fell on April 13. To celebrate this joyous occasion, President Xi Jinping and President Joko \u201cJokowi\u201d Widodo exchanged congratulatory letters and both countries launched commemorative stamps and envelopes.\nBoth China and Indonesia are ancient Asian civilizations. Through the ages, people of our two nations have traded goods, shared knowledge, and exchanged cultures along the ancient Maritime Silk Road. Together, they have composed one piece after another of beautiful music about their exchanges and interactions over the centuries.\nOur peoples sympathized with and supported each other in their respective struggle for national independence and liberation in the early 20th century. In 1950, Indonesia was among the first countries to establish diplomatic relations with China shortly after its founding.\nIn this new century, the bilateral relationship has grown by leaps and bounds, from establishing a strategic partnership in 2005 to a comprehensive strategic partnership in 2013. Our bilateral relations have embarked on a fast lane of growth.\nOver the years, President Xi paid two visits to Indonesia and President Jokowi five visits to China. Together, they have held eight bilateral meetings and exchanged four phone calls, reaching an important consensus on bilateral ties and charting the course for future relations. Two countries have established dialogue mechanisms at the vice premier level and maintained frequent exchanges between governments, legislatures and political parties, which have facilitated cooperation across the board.\nRead also:\nIndonesia, China launch special stamps celebrating 70 years of ties\nThe Initiative of 21st Century Maritime Silk Road was first announced in Indonesia. In 2018, the two governments signed a memorandum of understanding on jointly building the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and Global Maritime Fulcrum. Steady progress is being made in the Jakarta-Bandung high-speed rail, the first of its kind in Southeast Asia. Intergovernmental cooperation on regional comprehensive economic corridors is well under way. China also plays a facilitating role in Indonesia\u2019s industrialization drive.\nChina has been Indonesia\u2019s top trading partner for nine consecutive years. Two-way trade reached US$79.4 billion in 2019, up by tenfold since 2000. In just five years, China\u2019s local investment ranking jumped from ninth to second place. Together, we have built Indonesia\u2019s longest cross-sea bridge, the Surabaya-Madura Bridge, and second-largest dam, Jatigede Dam. Morowali Industrial Park has turned Indonesia into the second-largest exporter of stainless steel in just five years.\nIn recent years, Indonesia has received an annual average of more than 2 million visits by Chinese citizens, making China a major source of foreign tourists in Indonesia. China is also the second-largest host of Indonesian students totaling more than 10,000.\nBoth China and Indonesia are major countries in Asia and members of the Group of 20, which makes our bilateral relations go beyond the bilateral context. We are making concerted efforts to push forward China-ASEAN cooperation, uphold peace and stability in the South China Sea, support Palestinians in their cause to liberation, safeguard free trade and multilateralism and jointly advance the interests of developing nations.\nAs China and Indonesia are battling the COVID-19 outbreak, our presidents have exchanged multiple phone calls and letters to offer sympathies and mutual support, and jointly attended the G20 Summit on COVID-19. When China was in the depths of this outbreak, it received cordial sympathies and generous donations from the Indonesian government and people across the society.\nThe Chinese side, in return, has spared no effort in helping Indonesia\u2019s fight against the pandemic by providing much-needed medical supplies and sharing best experience and practice on prevention and treatment. A friend in need is a friend indeed. Our action once again testifies to our profound friendship of solidarity and mutual assistance in times of adversity.\nFor seven decades, our relationship has kept surging forward; for seven decades, we striven forward with one heart and one mind. The world today is undergoing profound changes. China is now working to build a moderately prosperous society in all respects, while Indonesia endeavors to become one of the world\u2019s fifth largest economies.\nChina-Indonesia relations now stand at a new starting point, facing new opportunities. As remarked by President Xi in his congratulatory letter to President Jokowi, China and Indonesia share extensive common interests at bilateral, regional and multilateral levels and enormous potential for future cooperation.\nRead also:\nChina flies more medical supplies to Indonesia\nWe should continue to promote high-level exchanges and bring forward bilateral relations from a strategic and long-term perspective. While promoting greater synergy between BRI and Global Maritime Fulcrum, practical cooperation shall be broadened to even more sectors, all to the benefit of the two peoples.\nWe look forward to stronger exchanges covering culture, education, religion and youth to bring our friendship closer and pass it on from generation to generation. Stronger coordination on global and regional issues is needed to shape a new type of international relations featuring mutual respect, fairness, justice and win-win cooperation and to build a community with a shared future for mankind.\nJauh di mata, dekat di hati\n&nbsp;(Though living far, it is close to my heart). Chinese tradition advocates peace is more precious than anything else. Chinese people seek good neighborliness and harmony among all nations. Likewise, Indonesia advocates\n&nbsp;musyawarah\n&nbsp;(consensus),&nbsp;\nBhinneka Tunggal Ika\n&nbsp;(Unity in Diversity) and&nbsp;\ngotong royong\n&nbsp;(mutual cooperation). I believe with such similar cultural genes,\nChina and Indonesia will surely enjoy sound relations built on equal footing and mutual respect, as well as understand and accommodate each other and seek common ground while shelving differences and ushering in a new era for bilateral ties featuring win-win cooperation.\n---\nAmbassador of People\u2019s Republic of China to Indonesia\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Article\nChina\u2019s fast-changing economic adjustments\nIndonesia must regain credibility as an honest broker\nSouth Korea to form strategic partnership with Singapore next year\nJapan's Kishida to visit South Korea for summit with Yoon\nGovt invites China to help build super grid\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nMore in Academia\nView more\nAcademia\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo\u2019s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nPolitics\nIndonesia to pardon tens of thousands including Papua activists\nAcademia\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?\nAcademia\nStop with the LGBTQ scapegoating",

(JP/Deni Ghifari)\nI\nn November, President\nPrabowo Subianto\nvisited China, the United States, Peru, Brazil, the United Kingdom and United Arab Emirates (UAE)&nbsp;to strengthen bilateral and multilateral ties, highlighting Indonesia's growing influence in Asia and the Americas.\nAs 2025 approaches, the global landscape remains multipolar, with rising US-China&nbsp;tensions. Following the Non-Aligned Movement, Indonesia pursues an independent foreign policy prioritizing its national interests. Its strategic position along key maritime trade routes enhances its role in regional stability and global commerce.\nWhile China aims to reduce competitors' influence, Indonesia leverages its relationship with China to negotiate with the US and other advanced economies. However, Indonesia must carefully engage with China to protect its security and sovereignty. President Prabowo has reiterated his commitment to cooperation with China, but this evolving dynamic has overshadowed US diplomatic efforts. For a more effective approach, the US should reassess its policies toward Indonesia and focus on building strong economic partnerships.\nIn recent years, Indonesia has fundamentally redefined its maritime strategy,&nbsp;particularly under former president Joko \u201cJokowi\u201d Widodo\u2019s administration, enhancing its role in the Indo-Pacific with a strategic naval policy. This evolution positions Indonesia as a vital player in regional security and governance.\nAs the US and Indonesia celebrate 75 years of diplomatic ties, their relationship has evolved into a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership (CSP), reinforcing cooperation in addressing global challenges. This partnership is crucial for stability and prosperity, aligning with Indonesia's strategic goals through initiatives like the Indo-Pacific&nbsp;Economic Framework (IPEF).

(Reuters/Dilara Senkaya)\nJ\nust over a year ago, China gave Bashar al-Assad and his wife a warm welcome during their six-day visit to the country, offering the former Syrian leader a rare break from years of international isolation since the start of a civil war in 2011.\nAs the couple attended the Asian Games, President Xi Jinping vowed to support Assad in \"opposing external interference\" and in Syria's rebuilding, while his wife Asma was feted in Chinese media.\nBut the abrupt end to the rule of the authoritarian leader so explicitly backed by Xi only last year has dealt a blow to China's diplomatic ambitions in the Middle East and exposed the limits of its strategy in the region, analysts say.\nA coalition of rebels seized Syria's capital Damascus on Sunday after a lightning offensive that toppled&nbsp;Assad's regime and ended his family's 50-year dynasty.\n\"There's been a lot of an exaggerated sense of China's ability to shape political outcomes in the region,\" said Jonathan Fulton, a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council.\nWhile the collapse of the Assad regime was seen reducing the influence in the Arab world of his main backers, Iran and Russia, it was also a blow for China's global ambitions, said Fulton.\n\"A lot of what (China has) been doing internationally has relied on support with those countries, and their inability to prop up their biggest partner in the Middle East says quite a lot about their ability to do much beyond the region.\"\nTackling Hotspots&nbsp;\nAfter China brokered a deal between long-time rivals Saudi Arabia and Iran in 2023, Chinese media praised Beijing's rising profile in a neighbourhood long dominated by Washington.&nbsp;\nWang Yi, China's top diplomat, said the country would play a constructive role in handling global \"hotspot issues\".\nChina also brokered a truce between Fatah, Hamas and other rival Palestinian factions earlier this year and has made repeated calls for a ceasefire in Gaza.\nBut despite bringing Middle Eastern leaders to Beijing and rounds of \"shuttle diplomacy\" by its Middle Eastern envoy, Zhai Jun, in the months since, Palestinians have not formed a unity government and the conflict in Gaza continues.\n\"Assad's sudden downfall is not a scenario Beijing wishes to see,\" said Fan Hongda, a Middle East scholar at Shanghai International Studies University. \"China prefers a more stable and independent Middle East, as chaos or a pro-American orientation in the region does not align with China's interests.\"&nbsp;\nThe response by China's foreign ministry to Assad's fall has been muted, focusing on the safety of Chinese nationals and calling for a \"political solution\" to restore stability in Syria as soon as possible.\nMinistry of foreign affairs spokesperson, Mao Ning, on Monday appeared to leave an opening for engagement with the future government: \"China's friendly relations with Syria are for all Syrian people,\" she said.\nChinese experts and diplomats say Beijing will now bide its time before recognising a new government in Damascus.&nbsp;\nIt could use its expertise and financial muscle to support reconstruction, they say, but its commitments are likely to be limited because China has sought to minimise financial risks overseas in recent years.\nSyria joined China's flagship Belt and Road Initiative in 2022, but there have been no significant investments by Chinese firms since, partly due to sanctions.&nbsp;\nChina is \"not really able to fundamentally replace the West either as an economic partner, or diplomatic or military force in the region,\" said Bill Figueroa, assistant professor at the University of Groningen and an expert in China-Middle East relations.\n\"China in 2024 has way less money than China in 2013 - 2014, when the BRI was launched,\" Figueroa said. There is \"an obvious reassessment going on in the direction of safer investments and reducing China's risks overall,\" he added.\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Article\nUN General Assembly calls for 'unconditional' Gaza ceasefire\nPentagon chief urges 'close consultation' between Israel and US on Syria\nIndonesia must regain credibility as an honest broker\nTrump\u2019s second term could deepen Indonesia-China relations\nIndonesia urges citizens to exercise caution during transition of power in Syria\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nMore in World\nView more\nEurope\nUS announces new arms aid package for Ukraine worth $500 million\nMiddle East and Africa\nUS says Israel is acting in Syria for its own defence\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia welcomes UNGA resolution on immediate ceasefire in Gaza\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo\u2019s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nPolitics\nIndonesia to pardon tens of thousands including Papua activists\nAcademia\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?\nAcademia\nStop with the LGBTQ scapegoating",

(AFP/Chris Bouroncle)\nH\nuge cranes loom over Peru's massive new Chinese-funded Chancay port, a symbol of Beijing's growing influence in South America which is set to be inaugurated by President Xi Jinping on Thursday.\n\"It's nearly ready,\" Gonzalo Rios, deputy general manager of the Peruvian subsidiary of Chinese port operator Cosco Shipping, which has a 60 percent stake in the facility, said during a recent visit to the deep-water port.\nSituated around 50 miles (80 kilometers) north of the capital Lima, the $3.5 billion complex is expected to become a major hub for trade between South America and China.\nChancay's maximum depth is 17.8 meters (58.4 feet), two meters deeper than Lima's Callao port, making it capable of handling the world's biggest container ships.\n\"With the addition of this port, this part of the Pacific and Peru in particular could become the logistical hub of South America,\" Rios told AFP.\nThe facility will be unveiled by Xi and his Peruvian counterpart Dina Boluarte on the sidelines of this week's Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Lima.\nSouth America's 'Silk Road'&nbsp;\nThe port is the latest addition to the vast collection of railways, highways and other infrastructure projects built under China's massive Belt and Road Initiative.\nLaunched in 2013, the program initially focused on better connecting China with Europe, Africa and the rest of Asia but has since expanded to include South America.\nChancay, a fishing town of around 50,000 inhabitants, was chosen for its strategic location in the heart of South America.\nCosco Shipping Ports, which has a 30-year concession to operate the terminal, has forecast it will handle up to one million containers in its first year of operations.\nChancay is expected to be a major hub for imports of Asian electronics, textiles and other consumer goods and for the export of minerals, including lithium -- a metal used in mobile phone and laptop batteries -- from Chile and copper from both Chile and Peru.\n\"Peru is a source of raw materials for China,\" Oscar Vidarte, professor of international relations at the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru, told AFP.\nBilateral trade between the Asian giant and Peru, one of Latin America's fastest-growing economies for the past decade, stood at nearly $36 billion in 2023, making Peru China's fourth-largest Latin American trading partner.\n\"Our goal is to become the Singapore of Latin America,\" Peruvian Transport Minister Raul Perez told reporters at Chancay.\n\"We will have direct routes to Asia, in particular to China, which will reduce (shipping time) by 10, 15, even 20 days, depending on the route,\" compared to 35-40 days currently, he said.\nChancay port will also serve Chile, Colombia and Ecuador, among other South American countries, allowing them to skirt ports in Mexico and the United States for trade with Asia.\n\"It will allow China to position itself in this part of the world,\" Vidarte said.\nFrancisco Belaunde, a professor in international law at Lima University and other faculties, called it \"part of the battle for geopolitical influence\" in South America pitting China against the United States.\nConnected to the Pan-American highway&nbsp;-- a network of roads linking most of North and South America along the Pacific -- through a mile-long tunnel, the port will use artificial intelligence to inspect containers for drugs and other illicit goods, according to Perez, the transport minister.\nPeru is the world's biggest cocaine producer after Colombia.\nCurrently, much of the drug is smuggled through the port of Guayaquil in neighboring Ecuador.\n\"We will use the most advanced technology to ensure the safety of the containers,\" Perez said.\n&nbsp;\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn

(Pool/AFP/Ken Ishii)\nA\nfrican leaders descend on China's capital this week, seeking funds for big-ticket infrastructure projects as they eye mounting great power competition over resources and influence on the continent.\nChina has expanded ties with African nations in the past decade, furnishing them with billions in loans that have helped build infrastructure but also sometimes stoked controversy by saddling countries with huge debts.\nChina has sent hundreds of thousands of workers to Africa to build its megaprojects, while&nbsp;tapping the continent's vast natural resources including copper, gold, lithium and rare earth minerals.\nBeijing has said this week's China-Africa forum will be its largest diplomatic event since the Covid-19 pandemic, with leaders of South Africa, Nigeria, Kenya and other nations confirmed to attend and dozens of delegations expected.\nAfrican countries were \"looking to tap the opportunities in China for growth\", Ovigwe Eguegu, a policy analyst at consultancy Development Reimagined, told AFP.\nChina, the world's number two economy, is Africa's largest trading partner, with bilateral trade hitting US$167.8 billion in the first half of this year, according to Chinese state media.\nProspects\nEvery Monday\nWith exclusive interviews and in-depth coverage of the region's most pressing business issues, \"Prospects\" is the go-to source for staying ahead of the curve in Indonesia's rapidly evolving business landscape.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nBeijing's loans to African nations last year were their highest in five years, research by the Chinese Loans to Africa Database found. Top borrowers were Angola, Ethiopia, Egypt, Nigeria and Kenya.\nBut analysts said an economic slowdown in China has made Beijing increasingly reluctant to shell out big sums.&nbsp;\nChina has also resisted offering debt relief, even as some African nations have struggled to repay their loans -- in some cases being forced to slash spending on vital public services.&nbsp;\nSince the last China-Africa forum six years ago, \"the world experienced a lot of changes, including COVID, geopolitical tension and now these economic challenges\", Tang Xiaoyang of Beijing's Tsinghua University told AFP.\nThe \"old model\" of loans for \"large infrastructure and very rapid industrialization\" is simply no longer feasible, he said.\nThe continent is a key node in Beijing's Belt and Road Initiative, a massive infrastructure project and central pillar of Xi Jinping's bid to expand China's clout overseas.\nThe BRI has channeled much-needed investment to African countries for projects like railways, ports and hydroelectric plants.\nBut critics charge Beijing with saddling nations with debt and funding infrastructure projects that damage the environment.\nOne controversial project in Kenya, a $5 billion railway -- built with finance from Exim Bank of China -- connects the capital Nairobi with the port city of Mombasa.\nBut a second phase meant to continue the line to Uganda never materialized, as both countries struggled to repay BRI debts.\nKenya's President William Ruto last year asked China for a $1 billion loan and the restructuring of existing debt to complete other stalled BRI projects.&nbsp;\nThe country now owes China more than $8 billion.\nRecent deadly protests in Kenya were triggered by the government's need \"to service its debt burden to international creditors, including China\", said Alex Vines, head of the Africa Program at London's Chatham House.\nIn light of such events, Vines and other analysts expect African leaders at this week's forum to seek not only more Chinese investment but also more favorable loans.\nIn central Africa, Western and Chinese firms are racing to secure access to rare minerals.\nThe continent has rich deposits of manganese, cobalt, nickel and lithium -- crucial for renewable energy technology.\nThe Moanda region of Gabon alone contains as much as a quarter of known global reserves of manganese, and South Africa accounts for 37 percent of global output of the metal.\nCobalt mining is dominated by the Democratic Republic of Congo, which accounts for 70 percent of the world total. But in terms of processing, China is the leader, at 50 percent.\nMounting geopolitical tensions between the United States and China, which are clashing over everything from the status of self-ruled Taiwan to trade, also weigh on Africa.\nWashington has warned against what it sees as Beijing's malign influence.\nIn 2022, the White House said China sought to \"advance its own narrow commercial and geopolitical interests [and] undermine transparency and openness\".\nBeijing insists it does not want a new cold war with Washington but rather seeks \"win-win\" cooperation, promoting development while profiting from boosted trade.\n\"We do not just give aid, give them help,\" Tsinghua University's Tang said.\n\"We are just partners with you while you are developing. We are also benefiting from it.\"\nBut analysts fear African nations could be forced to pick sides.&nbsp;\n\"African countries lack leverage against China,\" Development Reimagined's Eguegu said.\n\"Some people [...] think you can use the US to balance China,\" he said. \"You cannot.\"\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Article\nChina\u2019s fast-changing economic adjustments\nGovt eyes 10% investment growth, chipmaking to achieve GDP target\nBiden pushes new Russia, Iran, Korea, China effort before Trump term\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources\nGovt halts big infrastructure in trade-off for food security: Minister\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nMore in Business\nView more\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nTech\nMinister says Apple 'losing out' by dragging its feet on $1b investment\nRegulations\nMinistry inks collab with army, police on food security\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo\u2019s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nPolitics\nIndonesia to pardon tens of thousands including Papua activists\nAcademia\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?\nAcademia\nStop with the LGBTQ scapegoating",

(Reuters/Athit Perawongmetha)\nW\ne call on outgoing President Joko \"Jokowi\" Widodo to use the worsening conflict along Myanmar's borders as an excuse to launch a new diplomatic offensive by engaging outside powers, especially China, to bring peace back to Myanmar.\nThe President could instruct Foreign Minister Retno LP Marsudi to immediately consult with her ASEAN counterparts to realize the initiative, for the sake of the well-being of millions of people in Myanmar, who have had to bear the brunt of the crisis.\nIndonesia should not hesitate to take this opportunity if it really intends to find a solution to the protracted conundrum in Myanmar. Since the Feb. 1, 2021, military coup in Myanmar, ASEAN has been persistent in dealing with the ensuing security and humanitarian crisis alone. Such rigidity is no longer relevant because it is evident that the Myanmar problem has spilled over to the region and beyond.\nIn their joint statement, issued after their summit in Jakarta in September last year, ASEAN leaders condemned the continuing acts of violence in Myanmar, which have caused prolonged suffering among the people, humanitarian crises and the destruction of public facilities, and have adversely impacted regional stability, particularly along the borders.\nThey decided to extend the temporary expulsion of the junta from any official meetings and functions of ASEAN until Myanmar\u2019s military junta complies with the five-point consensus (5PC). Such a tactic has proven ineffective, which is why ASEAN needs to find alternative measures.\nUnder Indonesia\u2019s chairmanship last year, ASEAN hardly made progress in solving the Myanmar cause.

And the engagement of Beijing is not a na\u00efve consideration. Whoever is in power in Myanmar, China\u2019s influence in the country will remain strong.\nThe military junta has been facing more serious armed resistance in the last several months. Video footage has been spread by rebels that purportedly shows them gaining ground in Shan state, which borders China.\nChina was reportedly upset because the Myanmar junta ignored Beijing\u2019s warning about the security situation at the border, where criminals are targeting Chinese nationals.\nOn Monday, the Chinese Foreign Ministry\u2019s spokesperson Mao Ning said that China facilitated the evacuation of a number of countries\u2019 citizens, including Thai citizens, from northern Myanmar through China to avoid conflict and will continue to maintain communication with relevant countries and provide assistance.\nASEAN worries that civil war will continue raging in Myanmar, and the people\u2019s suffering will be prolonged.&nbsp;No matter how slim the chance is, Indonesia and ASEAN should not miss the opportunity to end the Myanmar crisis. China\u2019s concern about the safety of its nationals is a starting point to open talks on peaceful settlement in Myanmar.\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Article\nICC\u2019s arrest warrant for Myanmar junta chief is a critical step forward\nMalaysia urges Chinese firms to avoid using it to dodge US tariffs\nWhy corruption could derail Indonesia\u2019s climate fight\nG20 Brazil: Lessons for an effective cooperation platform\nPrabowo\u2019s balancing act\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nMore in Opinion\nView more\nAcademia\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo\u2019s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nPolitics\nIndonesia to pardon tens of thousands including Papua activists\nAcademia\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?\nAcademia\nStop with the LGBTQ scapegoating",

(AFP/Tanh Chin Sothy)\nC\nambodia's Prime Minister Hun Manet on Monday launched a controversial $1.7 billion canal project that aims to provide a new link from the Mekong river to the sea.\nAt a launch event in Prek Takeo, southeast of the capital Phnom Penh, Manet called the 180-kilometre (110-mile) project \"historic\", as drums sounded and fireworks shot into the air.\nThe event was attended by thousands wearing t-shirts bearing images of Manet and his father Hun Sen\n,\n&nbsp;who ruled the country for nearly four decades.\n\"We must build this canal at all costs,\" said Manet, who drew cheers as he launched the project by pressing a ceremonial button with his wife Pich Chanmony.\nThe Funan Techo canal will run from a spot on the Mekong river, about an hour's drive southeast of Phnom Penh, to the sea in the Gulf of Thailand and is due to be completed in 2028.\nAround a third of cargo coming to and from Cambodia uses Vietnamese ports via the Mekong, but authorities hope this number will fall to around 10 percent once the canal is completed.\nThe limited capacity of the waterway -- 100 metres (328 feet) wide and 5.4 metres (17.7 feet) deep -- has raised questions about whether the lofty economic goals can be reached.\nThe project also comes shrouded in uncertainty, including its main purpose -- whether for shipping or irrigation -- who will fund it, and how it will affect the flow of the Mekong -- one of the world's longest rivers.\nConservationists have long warned that the river, which supports up to a quarter of the world's freshwater fish catch and half of Vietnam's rice production, is at risk from infrastructure projects, pollution, sand mining, and climate change.\nCambodia, Laos, Vietnam, and Thailand are signatories to the 1995 Mekong River Agreement, which governs the distribution of the river's resources.\nCambodia has notified the Mekong River Commission (MRC) of its plans for the canal, but Vietnam wants more information about the project.\n'Nose to breathe through'&nbsp;\nPhnom Penh argues the project affects only a Mekong tributary and therefore requires only the notification it has already submitted.\nThe canal, one of former prime minister Hun Sun's signature infrastructure projects, is seen as a galvanising national undertaking to build support for his successor and son.\nHun Sen has described the canal as giving the country a \"nose to breathe through\".\nThe government says the project will offer an alternative for container ships that currently cross into Vietnam before heading to the sea, allowing Cambodia to keep transport revenue in-country.\nIt says it is planning riverside economic zones along the route that it says could create tens of thousands of jobs for the country, which is among the poorest in Southeast Asia.\nVillagers living along the projected route of the canal, however, spoke to AFP about their anguish at having their homes expropriated as construction gets underway.\nSome, who live near the canal, said they were not invited to join the event, saying they watched the ceremony from home with mixed feelings.\n\"We feel both happy and worried because we have not been informed about the compensation,\" a 51-year woman, who asked not to be named, told AFP.&nbsp;\n\"We are asking for an appropriate compensation. People told us that when there are developments, there are tears. So we are worried about that.\"\nDeputy Prime Minister Sun Chanthol, who spearheaded the project, said at the event on Monday that the canal would benefit 1.6 million people and create \"thousands of jobs\".&nbsp;\nHe promised that the government would provide \"fair compensation\" to those affected by the project.&nbsp;\nRights activists in the country point to a pattern of expropriation for infrastructure projects that has left people struggling to relocate with minimal compensation.\nChina financed&nbsp;\nLast year, the China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC), a Chinese construction giant that has financed other infrastructure in Cambodia, agreed to a feasibility study of the project.\nCambodian officials have suggested the Chinese state-owned company could finance part of the canal, but CRBC has not released its study or made any public commitment.&nbsp;\nWhile Cambodia is a close ally of Beijing, Hun Sen has denied the canal will be part of China's Belt and Road infrastructure plan.\nThe project has sparked fears in neighbouring Vietnam that the canal could be used by Chinese warships.\nCambodia and China held their largest annual military exercises in May, involving several Chinese miliary vessels and hundreds of military personnel.\nIn December, two Chinese warships made a first visit to a Cambodian naval base that the United States says could be used to boost China's influence in the Gulf of Thailand.\nCambodian officials have repeatedly denied that the base, near the port city of Sihanoukville, is for use by any foreign power.\n&nbsp;\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Article\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nChina\u2019s fast-changing economic adjustments\nChinese guards on the ground in Myanmar could go disastrously wrong\n'Modern slavery': Indonesians in clutches of scam syndicates\nApple's dilemma: Indonesian consumers or supply chain efficiency\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nMore in World\nView more\nEurope\nUS announces new arms aid package for Ukraine worth $500 million\nMiddle East and Africa\nUS says Israel is acting in Syria for its own defence\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia welcomes UNGA resolution on immediate ceasefire in Gaza\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo\u2019s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nPolitics\nIndonesia to pardon tens of thousands including Papua activists\nAcademia\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?\nAcademia\nStop with the LGBTQ scapegoating",

(Pool/AFP/Asanka Ratnayake)\nC\nhinese Premier Li Qiang mixed a dash of \"panda diplomacy\" with a visit to a historic vineyard on Sunday to celebrate a thaw in once-icy trade ties with Australia.\nThe highest ranking Chinese official to visit Australia in seven years, Li's four-day trip offers the prospect of greater trade after Beijing lifted punitive measures against a string of major Australian exports.\nChina is by far Australia's biggest trading partner, taking in nearly 30 percent of its exports last year including major commodities iron ore and coal.\nTwo-way trade reached A$327 billion (US$216 billion) in 2023.\nSetting the warmer tone, Li took a trip to Adelaide Zoo in bright sunshine and announced China would loan new \"adorable\" giant pandas to replace popular pair Wang Wang and Fu Ni.\nThe Adelaide pandas, which have failed to produce offspring since their arrival in 2009, will return to China by the end of the year.\nProspects\nEvery Monday\nWith exclusive interviews and in-depth coverage of the region's most pressing business issues, \"Prospects\" is the go-to source for staying ahead of the curve in Indonesia's rapidly evolving business landscape.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\n\"I guess they must have missed their home a lot,\" said Li, the second most powerful man in China after President Xi Jinping.\nThe premier said China made the panda offer to honour the wishes of Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong, an Adelaide resident who has worked to stabilise the relationship with Beijing.\nWong said her own children would be \"very happy\" at the news, which she welcomed as a \"symbol of goodwill\".\nLi then joined Wong for a lunch at the 19th century Magill Estate vineyard, home of the original Penfolds winery and now part of the Australian global winemaker Treasury Wine Estates.\nWine was among a string of Australian exports, along with coal, timber, barley, beef, and lobsters, battered by Chinese sanctions in 2020 during a diplomatic rift with the former conservative government.\nThose sanctions cost Australian exporters an estimated A$20 billion a year, including A$1 billion for the wine industry.\nThe tariffs have been gradually lifted since Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's government took power in 2022 and adopted a softer diplomatic approach towards China. Lobster is one of the few exports still facing trade barriers.\nLi and Albanese are set to hold talks behind closed doors in Canberra on Monday, encompassing fractious issues of foreign influence, human rights, alleged \"unsafe\" behaviour by China's military in the region, and their rivalry in the Pacific.\nChina's growing clout in the South Pacific, where it seeks to expand security and economic ties with island states traditionally allied with Australia, remains a notable point of tension.\n\"We're in a state of permanent contest in the Pacific. That's the reality,\" Wong told a television interviewer Sunday.\nBut the Chinese premier, who will also head to a lithium mine in Perth, is focusing his attention on economic opportunities despite areas of friction.\n\"Mutual respect, seeking common ground while shelving differences and mutually beneficial cooperation\" are key to the relationship, Li said on his arrival in Adelaide on Saturday.\nAustralia has endured \"a long period of deep freeze, where it was not possible to have any sort of official conversations with China\", said Melissa Conley Tyler, honorary fellow at the University of Melbourne's Asia Institute.&nbsp;\nLi's visit sends a message that \"Australia is back to being seen as a friendly country rather than the unfriendly, hostile country we were seen as during those years of maximum tension,\" she told AFP.\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Article\nOfficials to form new import task force separate from Trade Ministry\nForeign Minister Sugiono lists priorities in debut meeting with lawmakers\nChina's Xi calls for more free trade\nHow a second Trump presidency will impact Indonesia\u2019s economy\nRubio pick signals a Trump China policy that could go beyond tariffs\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nMore in Business\nView more\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nTech\nMinister says Apple 'losing out' by dragging its feet on $1b investment\nRegulations\nMinistry inks collab with army, police on food security\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo\u2019s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nPolitics\nIndonesia to pardon tens of thousands including Papua activists\nAcademia\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?\nAcademia\nStop with the LGBTQ scapegoating",

Minister Chris Hipkins during a signing ceremony at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on June 28, 2023.\n(AFP/Jade Gao)\nC\nhina's Premier Li Qiang will travel to Australia this weekend on the highest-ranking visit in seven years, Canberra announced Tuesday, as the two nations' trade ties improve despite their strategic rivalry in the Pacific.\nLi's four-day trip, which begins Saturday, comes after Beijing lifted most of the trade barriers it had imposed on Australian exports, including coal, timber, barley, and wine.\nRock lobsters are one of the last barred Australian exports yet to re-enter the lucrative market.\n\"Premier Li Qiang's visit to Australia is an important opportunity to engage directly on key issues for both our nations,\" Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said.\n\"China is Australia's largest trading partner and our economic relationship continues to bring substantial benefits to both our countries.\"\nLi is also scheduled to visit New Zealand sometime this week.\nChina slapped trade sanctions on Australia in 2020, angered by Canberra's exclusion of Huawei from its 5G network, new foreign interference laws and its support for an international probe into the origins of Covid-19.\nBut relations have warmed since Albanese's centre-left government took power in 2022, adopting a less strident diplomatic tone than its conservative predecessor.\nAlbanese was given a gala welcome to Beijing in November last year, with a smiling President Xi Jinping promising Australia and China could become \"trusted partners\".\nOn defence, however, Australia has pursued a tight alliance with the United States as it seeks to parry China's expanding diplomatic and military influence in the Pacific region.\n\"Australia continues to pursue a stable and direct relationship with China, with dialogue at its core,\" Albanese said.\n\"We will cooperate where we can, disagree where we must and engage in our national interest.\"\nPacific strategy&nbsp;\nIn the South Pacific, Canberra and Washington were jolted into strengthening their ties with island nations after Beijing signed a secretive security deal with Solomon Islands in 2022.\nThe Pacific Islands, while small in population, are replete with natural resources and sit at a geostrategic crossroads that could prove vital in any military dispute over Taiwan.\nAustralia also supports the United States and Asian countries in opposing Beijing's sovereignty claims over the South China Sea.\nAnd it has provoked Chinese ire by joining a landmark Australia-UK-US defence agreement, AUKUS, that was revealed in September 2021.\nThe accord notably aims to supply Canberra with a fleet of stealthy nuclear-powered but conventionally armed submarines to patrol the region's waters.\nAustralia hopes to have eight nuclear-powered vessels in the water by the 2050s -- a mix of the new AUKUS-class subs built at home and in the UK, and Virginia-class vessels purchased from the United States.&nbsp;\nIn a national defence strategy unveiled in April, Canberra said the submarines were at the heart of a higher-spending policy aimed at protecting the island continent's trade and access to air and sea.\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians

(Reuters/Adrian Portugal)\nA\nlack of unity among ASEAN nations is regarded as the core stumbling block to immediately concluding the long-awaited code of conduct (COC) in the South China Sea, which had been expected to establish a guiding framework for preventing an open conflict in the troubled waters.\nASEAN Secretary-General Kao Kim Hourn revealed recently that the negotiations between the association and China would be completed by next year, but many remain doubtful.&nbsp;\nDafri Agussalim, the executive director of the ASEAN Studies Center at Gadjah Mada University (UGM) in Yogyakarta, told\nThe Jakarta Post\nthat each ASEAN member seemed to have its own vested interests in China\u2019s economic influence, putting shared interests behind.\n\u201cI\u2019m not too confident about the deadline. You can see that each ASEAN member has its individual interests that it puts ahead of the association\u2019s, which eventually affects all internal negotiations. This is clear in, say, the Myanmar case as well,\u201d Dafri said.\nThe Myanmar political crisis, which has now entered its third year, has put considerable pressure on ASEAN as calls for the association to broker peace have been met with lackluster results. Analysts have pointed to disagreements between ASEAN members, some of which are widely suspected of being sympathetic to Naypyidaw\u2019s illegal junta, as being among the chief causes of the association\u2019s perceived sluggish response.\nRead also:\nWhither ASEAN in the South China Sea?\nDafri further mentioned that ASEAN members\u2019 participation in counter-China military exercises might also send Beijing a signal that the association was not sincere in its diplomatic negotiations.\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Article\nIs Southeast Asia the next frontier for AI?\nASEAN ministers to discuss Myanmar at Thailand meeting, Indonesia says\nIndonesia has not surrendered sovereign rights in the North Natuna Sea\nPrabowo\u2019s new approach to RI-China relations\nASEAN urges early accord on South China Sea code, end to Myanmar violence\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nMore in World\nView more\nEurope\nUS announces new arms aid package for Ukraine worth $500 million\nMiddle East and Africa\nUS says Israel is acting in Syria for its own defence\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia welcomes UNGA resolution on immediate ceasefire in Gaza\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo\u2019s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nPolitics\nIndonesia to pardon tens of thousands including Papua activists\nAcademia\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?\nAcademia\nStop with the LGBTQ scapegoating",

Chung Sung-Jun/Pool via REUTERS (Reuters/Chung Sung-Jun)\nI\nn their joint declaration that capped their&nbsp;trilateral summit on May 27, host South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and Chinese Premier Li Qiang paid much attention to the strategic importance of ASEAN, apparently because the three leaders found it impossible to find common ground on North Korea, the Taiwan Strait and other regional security threats.\nOne of the prominent examples of their common view on ASEAN is their agreement to use the ASEAN-led Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), billed as the world\u2019s largest free trade agreement, as the basis for&nbsp;their negotiations to reach a much more sophisticated trade pact among them.\nAccording to media reports, the three East Asian leaders agreed to \"keep discussions for speeding up negotiations for a Trilateral FTA\".\nIn their joint statement, the three leaders affirmed \u201cthe importance of ensuring implementation in a transparent, smooth and effective manner of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) Agreement as the basis of a Trilateral Free Trade Agreement (FTA)\u201d.\n\u201cWe will keep discussions for speeding up negotiations for a Trilateral FTA, aiming at realizing a free, fair, comprehensive, high-quality, and mutually beneficial FTA with its own value,\u201d the joint statement reads.\nIt remains too early to get a clearer picture of how ASEAN nations will benefit from the political rapprochement among their northeastern&nbsp;neighbors, which are among their most important trading and investment partners. China and Japan&nbsp;have been competing for influence in&nbsp;Southeast Asia, while South Korea is smartly playing the alternative role thanks to its advanced technology.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nJapanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has softened his ambition to revive the stalled free trade scheme, the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), which was originally aimed at, among other goals, containing China in what was supposed to be&nbsp;close collaboration with the United States.\nIt seems the turnaround has helped the Japanese leader achieve&nbsp;major progress in the negotiation of the trilateral free trade agreement during the Seoul summit. The talks stalled in 2019 because of China\u2019s objections.\nChina, the world\u2019s second-largest economy, Japan, the fourth, and South Korea, the 14\nth\n, are parties to the RCEP, which was approved in 2020 but came into effect on Jan. 1, 2022. Aside from the 10-member ASEAN, other signatories of the legally binding agreement are Australia and New Zealand.\nKishida said, as quoted by the Japanese Foreign Ministry, that Japan intends to have a candid exchange of views on how a future-oriented trilateral free trade agreement should be organized, including&nbsp;high-level economic discipline&nbsp;among the three countries, which have deep ties in both trade and investment, aiming for an RCEP-plus agreement.\nAs recently as February, Japan and the US had supported&nbsp;the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), which grouped mostly Western countries and sought to contain China. However, under president Donald Trump in 2016, Washington axed the TPP.&nbsp;\nHoping the US would return to the trade bloc someday, Japan and Australia sponsored the CPTPP. But later they realized that the US would never come back. As if to add insult to injury, China applied to join the new trade bloc.\nThe CPTPP was practically dead when Joe Biden took office in January 2021. The US president opted not to revive the TPP because of strong domestic opposition to the trade pact.\nBiden then proposed the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF), which did not need the approval of&nbsp;Congress. ASEAN countries accepted the invitation to join the new group more as a matter of diplomatic courtesy to Biden.\nDuring the Seoul summit, the three East Asian leaders expressed their commitment to a closer relationship with ASEAN, one of the world\u2019s most powerful regional organizations and which continues to attract attention from global powers, including the US and its allies.\nChinese Premier Li Qiang praised what he called a restart in relations with Japan and South Korea as he met President Yoon and PM Kishida for the first three-way talks&nbsp;in four years, agreeing to revive trade and security dialogues hampered by global tensions.\n\"For China, South Korea&nbsp;and Japan, our close ties will not change, the spirit of cooperation achieved through crisis response will not change and our mission to safeguard regional peace and stability will not change,\" Li said as quoted by Reuters.\nLi also emphasized close ties with ASEAN, given the region\u2019s stability and stellar economic performance.\n\u201cChina, Japan and South Korea should leverage their respective development strengths to create a new engine for regional cooperation that actively addresses the needs of ASEAN and other neighboring countries. The three countries should work together to boost the momentum of ASEAN Plus Three cooperation,\u201d Premier Li said, as quoted by Xinhua.\nASEAN+3 refers to a dialogue forum involving&nbsp;ASEAN,&nbsp;China, Japan and South Korea that. was initiated in December 1997 and has since evolved to be&nbsp;the main vehicle to promote East Asian cooperation.\nKishida concurred, acknowledging ASEAN\u2019s pivotal role in maintaining peace in the Indo-Pacific region, where great power&nbsp;rivalry is simmering.\n\u201cASEAN plays a central role in regional stability and prosperity and also welcomes the revitalization of the trilateral process. It is thus more and more important for the three countries to cooperate with ASEAN for mainstreaming ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific [AOIP]&nbsp;in order to bring about stability and prosperity in the region,\u201d&nbsp;Kishida said.\nIt remains to be seen how ASEAN will seize the opportunities up for grabs following the Seoul trilateral summit. ASEAN could&nbsp;be an unlikely beneficiary of&nbsp;the tensions and competition among its&nbsp;three northeastern neighbors.\nFor Indonesia, the new development is&nbsp;low hanging fruit, especially for the incoming government.

(AFP/AFP)\nP\napua New Guinea Prime Minister James Marape says his nation does not deserve to be labelled cannibals, and urged the US to clear up the remnants of World War Two littered across the Pacific, after remarks by President Joe Biden&nbsp;\nlast week\n&nbsp;about his missing serviceman uncle.\nBiden had \"appeared to imply his uncle was eaten by cannibals after his plane was shot down over PNG during WWII\", Marape's office said in a statement late on Sunday.\n\"President Biden's remarks may have been a slip of the tongue; however, my country does not deserve to be labelled as such,\" Marape said.\nThe comments come amid competition for influence between the United States and China in Papua New Guinea and the wider Indo-Pacific region, which saw the US sign a defence cooperation agreement with PNG last year, while Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi met with Marape in Port Moresby on Sunday.\nIn an emailed response when asked to comment on Marape's remarks, a spokesperson for the US State Department said the US \"respects the people and culture of Papua New Guinea and remains committed to furthering respectful relations between our democracies.\"\nIt said Biden had highlighted his uncle's story \"as he made the case for honoring our sacred commitment to equip those we send to war.\"\nThe spokesperson referred to \"shared sacrifices\" by the US and PNG in World War Two and praised the \"resilience, courage, and commitment to democratic ideals\" of its people. It called the country \"a regional leader with diverse cultures.\"\nIn his statement, Marape urged the White House \"to look into cleaning up these remains of WWII so the truth about missing servicemen like Ambrose Finnegan can be put to rest.\"\nBiden has previously cited his&nbsp;\npersonal connection\n&nbsp;with Papua New Guinea's wartime history on visits to Australia, telling the story of Finnegan, his uncle who died in a plane crash in May 1944.\nBiden raised the possibility Finnegan might have fallen victim to cannibals after visiting a memorial to war missing in Pennsylvania.\nHistorians say Papua New Guinea was crucial to the US drive across the Pacific to liberate the Philippines in World War Two, while Australia has said the wartime history showed the renewed strategic importance of its northern neighbour.\nThe impact of the war remains&nbsp;\nsensitive among\n&nbsp;Pacific Islanders, however.\nMarape said his nation was \"needlessly dragged into a conflict that was not their doing\".\nPapua New Guinea and Solomon Islands remain littered with wartime human remains, plane wrecks, ship wrecks and tunnels, as well as leftover bombs that were still killing people, he said.\nChina has a security pact with PNG's neighbour, the Solomon Islands, and Wang Yi met with Marape to discuss building closer economic ties.

(Office of the Coordinating Maritime Affairs and Investment Minister/-)\nC\nhina's foreign minister on Saturday accused Western powers in the AUKUS security pact of provoking division and risking nuclear proliferation in the South Pacific.\nOn a weekend visit to strengthen Beijing's ties with Papua New Guinea, Foreign Minister Wang Yi lashed out at AUKUS, which provides for the United States and Britain to equip Australia with nuclear-powered but conventionally armed submarines.\nThe three-way AUKUS agreement \"runs counter\" to a South Pacific treaty banning nuclear weapons in the region, he told a news conference in Port Moresby.\nAUKUS also \"raises serious nuclear proliferation risks\", the Chinese foreign minister told reporters after meeting with his Papua New Guinea counterpart Justin Tkatchenko.\nIn recent years, Beijing has tried to chip away at US and Australian influence across the South Pacific, including in Papua New Guinea.&nbsp;\nThe Pacific Islands, while small in population, are replete with natural resources and sit at a geostrategic crossroads that could prove strategically vital in any military dispute over Taiwan.&nbsp;\nAustralia is by far Papua New Guinea's largest donor, but Chinese firms have made solid inroads into markets in the impoverished but resource-rich nation.\nThe Chinese foreign minister seized on a recent announcement by the AUKUS nations that they are considering cooperating with Japan on military technology.\nUnder the AUKUS agreement, the partners plan to develop advanced warfighting capabilities such as artificial intelligence, undersea drones and hypersonic missiles.&nbsp;\n\"The recent attempts to draw more countries to join in such an initiative of stoking confrontation between blocs and provoking division are totally inconsistent with the urgent needs of the island countries,\" the foreign minister said.\nWang took a thinly veiled swipe at Australian and US relations with Solomon Islands, which held elections on Wednesday.\nThe Solomons' incumbent prime minister, Manasseh Sogavare, has embraced China while his main challengers view Beijing's growing influence with a mix of skepticism and alarm.\nA new government has yet to be agreed among elected MPs.\n\"We believe that the people of Solomon Islands have the wisdom and ability to determine the future of their country. Island nations belong to their people,\" Wang said.\n\"They are not the backyard of any big country,\" Wang said -- an allusion to historic perceptions that Australia considered the South Pacific to be its backyard.\nState-backed Chinese news outlets have pushed reports that the United States might orchestrate riots to block Sogavare from returning to power.&nbsp;\nUS Ambassador to the Solomons Ann Marie Yastischock has said such rumors are \"blatantly misleading\".&nbsp;\nPapua New Guinea's foreign minister welcomed the Chinese minister, saying they had \"reached some understanding\" in their talks.\n\"PNG values China as an important bilateral partner,\" he said.\nWang is scheduled to have breakfast with Papua New Guinea Prime Minister James Marape on Sunday, wrapping up a three-nation tour of Indonesia, Cambodia and Papua New Guinea that began April 18.\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Article\nNavigating Indonesia-US relations amid global and domestic changes\nRussia teams up with BRICS to create AI alliance\nIndonesia must regain credibility as an honest broker\nTrump\u2019s second term could deepen Indonesia-China relations\nBiden pushes new Russia, Iran, Korea, China effort before Trump term\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nMore in World\nView more\nEurope\nUS announces new arms aid package for Ukraine worth $500 million\nMiddle East and Africa\nUS says Israel is acting in Syria for its own defence\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia welcomes UNGA resolution on immediate ceasefire in Gaza\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo\u2019s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nPolitics\nIndonesia to pardon tens of thousands including Papua activists\nAcademia\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?\nAcademia\nStop with the LGBTQ scapegoating",

(Reuters/Florence Lo)\nA\nnational election in the Solomon Islands, the first since Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare signed a security pact with Beijing, will be watched next week for its potential to jolt the United States-China rivalry in the South Pacific.\nThe US and Australia are concerned about China's naval ambitions in Pacific countries, as tensions rise over Taiwan.\nDespite its population of just 700,000, the Solomon Islands occupies a strategic position 1,600 kilometers northeast of Australia, strewn with World War Two wrecks that remind it was once a pivotal battlefield.\nVoters will be focused on hospitals struggling without medicines, education shortcomings and inadequate roads when they cast ballots on Wednesday, April 17, opposition party lawmakers said.\nBut Sogavare's rapid embrace of China since he won power four years ago \u2014 including inviting Chinese police into the archipelago and switching diplomatic ties from Taiwan \u2014 is also in the spotlight.\n\"The services and economy are really in a desperate situation. The issue of China and this new relationship is also important. That is a source of anger towards Sogavare,\" said Democratic Alliance Party leader Rick Houenipwela, who was prime minister before Sogavare.\nSogavare, installed as prime minister by independent candidates who won a combined 37% of the vote in 2019, has pointed to hosting the Pacific Games as a major achievement and pledged to strengthen relations with China.\nChina donated stadiums for the Games, and is building ports, roads and a Huawei telecommunications network.\nOpposition parties said they would scrap the China security pact or hold a national referendum on it, and reduce China's influence by accepting more infrastructure support from US allies.\n&nbsp;\n'Not convinced'\nPeter Kenilorea, whose United Party won 10 percent of votes in 2019, said he wants Solomon Islands to return to being a reliable partner of Australia and New Zealand, and would abolish the China security pact.\n\"We're not convinced it's in the interests of Solomon Islands,\" he said.\nClosely watched will be election results in Malaita, the most populous province, which has long criticized deepening China ties and is where opposition parties hope to gain nine seats.\nMalaita's governor Daniel Suidani refused to allow Chinese companies to operate in the province until he was ousted in a no-confidence vote in 2023.\nHis replacement, Martin Fini, has signed Chinese cooperation deals, including last week, when China's special envoy for the Pacific Qian Bo visited Malaita.\nThe prime minister is selected by winning lawmakers, often weeks after the election results.\nHouenipwela's party has formed a coalition with Matthew Wale's Solomon Islands Democratic Party, which won the biggest vote (14 percent) in 2019, and is seeking a combined majority of 26 seats.\nAustralian National University Pacific expert Graeme Smith said the shift away independents was a significant development this election, with Sogavare also convincing many government members to join his new party.\nAustralia has sent 400 police and military to assist Royal Solomon Islands Police Force (RSIPF) with election security, alongside New Zealand and Pacific forces. Chinese police will remain in a training role, the RSIPF said.\nElection observer groups from Australia, New Zealand, the Pacific, Japan, Europe and the US will monitor voting and counting, with national and provincial polls held on the same day.\nSogavare, who didn't respond to a request for comment, has said publicly he would not host a Chinese military base \u2014 which Washington and Canberra have said is a red line.\nChina says its security cooperation Solomon Islands is a sovereign matter for the two countries and has denied it wants a military base, but US military leaders remain unconvinced.\n\"The increased policing presence in the Solomon Islands is concerning, that's a foot in the door, and then we'll see where it goes from there,\" commander of the US Indo Pacific Command, Adm. John Aquilino, said in an interview.\n\"But the goal is to have the ability to deliver infrastructure and ultimately a place for Chinese military power.\"\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Article\nAustralia to charge tech companies for news content if they do not pay\nBiden pushes new Russia, Iran, Korea, China effort before Trump term\nDharma\u2019s surprising uptick in support reflects growing protest votes\nRidwan gears up for runoff despite rival claiming single-round victory\nIndonesian government aims to return foreign prisoners by January\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nMore in World\nView more\nEurope\nUS announces new arms aid package for Ukraine worth $500 million\nMiddle East and Africa\nUS says Israel is acting in Syria for its own defence\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia welcomes UNGA resolution on immediate ceasefire in Gaza\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo\u2019s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nPolitics\nIndonesia to pardon tens of thousands including Papua activists\nAcademia\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?\nAcademia\nStop with the LGBTQ scapegoating",

President Mohamed Muizzu of the Maldives vowed on November 17 to expel Indian troops deployed in the strategically located archipelago, in his first speech to the nation after being sworn into power.  (AFP/Ishara Kodikara)\nT\nhe Maldives has signed a \"military assistance\" deal with China after ordering Indian troops deployed in the small but strategically-placed archipelago to leave, officials said Tuesday.\nSome 89 Indian military personnel in the country will be gone by May 10 after having been previously ordered out by pro-China President Mohamed Muizzu, who came to power last year on an anti-Indian platform.\nThe Maldivian defence ministry said they signed an \"agreement on China's provision of military assistance\" with Beijing late Monday, saying the agreement was \"gratis\", or without payment or charge, but giving no further details.\nThe defence ministry said the deal was to foster \"stronger bilateral ties\", in a post on social media platform X.\nIndia is suspicious of China's growing presence in the Indian Ocean and its influence in the Maldives, a chain of 1,192 tiny coral islands stretching around 800 kilometres (500 miles) across the equator, as well as in neighbouring Sri Lanka.\nBoth South Asian island nations are strategically placed halfway along key east-west international shipping routes.\nRelations between Male and New Delhi have chilled since Muizzu won elections in September.\nNew Delhi considers the Indian Ocean archipelago to be within its sphere of influence, but the Maldives has shifted into the orbit of China -- its largest external creditor.\nMuizzu, who visited Beijing in January where he signed a raft of infrastructure, energy, marine and agricultural deals, has previously denied seeking to redraw the regional balance by bringing in Chinese forces to replace Indian troops.\nChinese foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning told reporters Tuesday that Beijing was doing \"its utmost to jointly build a comprehensive strategic cooperative partnership\" with the archipelago.\n\"Normal cooperation between China and the Maldives does not target any third party and does not undergo any interference by third parties,\" she added.\n'Surveillance'&nbsp;\nIndia last week said it was bolstering its naval forces on its \"strategically important\" Lakshadweep islands, about 130 kilometres (80 miles) north of the Maldives.\nThe Indian naval unit based on the island of Minicoy will boost \"operational surveillance\" of the area, the navy said.\nAddressing a public rally north of the capital on Monday, Muizzu vowed there would be no Indian troops on Maldivian soil after May 10, when they are expected to complete a withdrawal.\nThe Indians had been deployed to operate three reconnaissance aircraft New Delhi had gifted Male to patrol its vast maritime boundary.\nIndia is expected to replace the military personnel with civilian staff to operate the aircraft, and the Maldives defence ministry announced last month that Indian civilian crew had begun arriving in the atoll nation.\nLast month, Male allowed a controversial Chinese research ship to enter its waters in a sign of the nation's diplomatic reorientation towards Beijing and away from its traditional benefactor India.\nChina's Xiang Yang Hong 3 arrived in Male after being refused permission to dock by Sri Lanka following objections from India, which has labelled it a spy ship.\nChina also gave 12 electric ambulances to the Maldives on Sunday, the health ministry said.\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019:

(Antara/M Agung Rajasa)\nVersi Bahasa Indonesia\nL\naotian Prime Minister Sonexay Siphandone handed over ASEAN\u2019s rotary chairmanship to Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim on Friday after closing the bloc\u2019s leaders\u2019 summit and meetings with dialogue partners in Vientiane. Laos deserves commendation for its success in leading the regional bloc over the past year.\nSiphandone proved his country\u2019s economic and political influence in the region despite its small geographic size and GDP compared to Indonesia, the largest economy in Southeast Asia. The Laotian leaders have done their best and complied with all the principles agreed upon by the ASEAN leaders at the previous summit in Jakarta.\nOn the Myanmar issue, for instance, critics had wrongly predicted that Laos would opt for a soft approach in dealing with the military junta, which has been barred from attending all official ASEAN forums for failing to respect the bloc\u2019s five-point consensus for peace, which includes the restoration of democracy and a cessation of hostilities in the strife-torn nation. The junta was allowed to send a career diplomat to the summit last week only with the prior approval of all ASEAN leaders.\nAt the East Asia Summit, an annual leadership meeting between ASEAN and its dialogue partners including China, Japan, South Korea, India, Canada, Australia and India, the leaders issued a joint statement that covered various sensitive issues, such as the recent developments in the Korean Peninsula and Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.\nRegarding the South China Sea dispute, the leaders emphasized the importance of self-restraint in the conduct of all claimants and other states, \u201cincluding those mentioned in the 2002 Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea (DOC) that could further complicate the situation and escalate tensions in the South China Sea\".\nMalaysia will officially start its ASEAN chairmanship in January and has revealed an official logo as well as the theme \u201cInclusivity and Sustainability\u201d for its tenure. PM Anwar has a vast knowledge of ASEAN, and we hope that he can not only conclude ASEAN\u2019s unfinished business but also create a more solid foundation for the group\u2019s bid to realize its 2045 vision.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nIn the meantime, Indonesia will very likely take a more progressive approach to ASEAN under the leadership of\nPrabowo Subianto\nthan during the 10-year presidency of Joko \u201cJokowi\u201d Widodo, who will leave office on Oct. 20. Adding to his numerous missed opportunities, Jokowi decided to skip the ASEAN summit.\nThere are several unfinished agenda items that ASEAN needs to address soon, rather than later.\nFirst is the ravaging civil war in Myanmar. Newly elected&nbsp;Thai PM Paetongtarn Shinawatra has offered to host an informal meeting on Myanmar in December. ASEAN can no longer rigidly stick to the five-point consensus as the only currency in dealing with the Myanmar military junta.\nThe Thai PM rightly proposed the more active involvement of larger neighbors such as China and India in ending the systematic atrocities by both the military and rebel groups. Indonesia should actively engage with the Thai initiative.\nSecondly, for the interests of both ASEAN and Timor-Leste, the accession of the nation should be accelerated and more affirmative action should be offered.\nBoth PM Siphandone and PM Anwar have declared their readiness to formalize Timor-Leste\u2019s membership soon. Last week's summit was attended by Timor-Leste PM Xanana Gusmao.\nThere are no more excuses to delay the entry of Timor-Leste into ASEAN now that many countries and international agencies have offered their help for Timor-Leste to fulfill the requirements set by ASEAN. Singapore, which initially resisted the plan, has softened its stance.\nThird is the contentious issue of the South China Sea.&nbsp;As ASEAN chair, Laos, unlike Cambodia, did not try to please China during the ASEAN summit.\nASEAN and China have agreed to expedite negotiations on the non-binding Code of Conduct on the South China Sea. Hopefully, this pledge is not just talk. The code of conduct would help the two parties build trust, which is sorely needed to maintain regional peace and stability.\nThank you Laos, and welcome new chair Malaysia.\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Article\nChinese guards on the ground in Myanmar could go disastrously wrong\nIndonesia must regain credibility as an honest broker\nThree dead, thousands displaced as Malaysia warns of worst floods in a decade\nLaos government says 'profoundly saddened' by tourist deaths\nPrabowo\u2019s new approach to RI-China relations\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nMore in Opinion\nView more\nAcademia\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo\u2019s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nPolitics\nIndonesia to pardon tens of thousands including Papua activists\nAcademia\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?\nAcademia\nStop with the LGBTQ scapegoating",

Indonesian car exports were up 10.6 percent in the January to November period from the same period last year. (Antara/Andika Wahyu)\nThe year 2024 presents a challenging landscape for the global economy.\nHigh levels of uncertainty, driven by geopolitical tensions, high interest rates and persistent inflation, have disrupted supply chains. These conditions significantly impact global trade performance, including that of Indonesia. Domestic trade performance is also affected by the economic slowdown in China, initiated by the trade war with the United States and followed by a crisis in the property sector.\nThe Chinese government's strict policies, coupled with demographic issues such as a large and non-productive elderly population and high social burdens, have limited China's economic growth. The weakening of China's economy is evident from its average economic growth since 2012 until pre-COVID-19, which was only 6.29 percent, lower than the 2003-2011 average of 10.86 percent. The weakening Chinese economy also directly impacts global commodity prices and negatively affects commodity-dependent countries like Indonesia.\nIndonesia's economy has long relied on China, with this dependency understood from various perspectives.\nChina is Indonesia's largest trading partner, with significant trade volumes between the two countries. Additionally, China is a major investor in Indonesia, especially in the infrastructure and natural resources sectors. Direct investment from Chinese companies has influenced Indonesia's economic growth, particularly in job creation and infrastructure improvement. Furthermore, China's substantial economic power and high production capacity make it a primary choice for Indonesia in importing consumer and capital goods. This dependency allows Indonesia access to cheaper products but also involves supply failure risks if there are disruptions in China's economy.\nIn 2023, Indonesia's export market share in the global market was only 1.1 percent of the total global export value, with total exports reaching US$258.8 billion, a decline of 11.34 percent year-on-year (yoy), impacted by the global economic slowdown, particularly in China, which accounts for 22.9 percent of Indonesia's exports, significantly affecting Indonesia's export value, even if export volume may not change significantly.\nProspects\nEvery Monday\nWith exclusive interviews and in-depth coverage of the region's most pressing business issues, \"Prospects\" is the go-to source for staying ahead of the curve in Indonesia's rapidly evolving business landscape.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nIndonesia's export performance in the first five months of 2024 reached $104 billion, a decline of 3.52 percent yoy. Although still contracting, there are signs of improvement compared with the first five months of 2023, which saw a decline of 6.1 percent yoy. This improvement is due to better performance from export destination countries, especially non-oil and gas, which account for 93.6 percent of total exports, with destinations such as India, the US, the Philippines, Japan and the Netherlands. With a significant share of non-oil and gas exports, we must continue to increase capacity to ensure export performance grows. Despite some indicators showing signs of improvement, these challenges require appropriate policies and international cooperation to ensure long-term economic stability and growth.\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Article\nChina\u2019s fast-changing economic adjustments\nBusinesses welcome EUDR delay, but compliance still challenging\nIndonesia must regain credibility as an honest broker\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nChina's exports grow at fastest pace in over two years\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nMore in Business\nView more\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nTech\nMinister says Apple 'losing out' by dragging its feet on $1b investment\nRegulations\nMinistry inks collab with army, police on food security\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo\u2019s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nPolitics\nIndonesia to pardon tens of thousands including Papua activists\nAcademia\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?\nAcademia\nStop with the LGBTQ scapegoating",

Both state leaders witnessed the signing of multiple Memoranda of Understanding by Indonesian and Chinese Ministers. (Antara/Desca Lidya Natalia)\nP\nresident Joko \"Jokowi\" Widodo wasted a golden opportunity to share with Chinese President Xi Jinping Indonesia's experience as a heavy debtor to Western countries and Japan for three decades when they met at the third Belt and Road Forum (BRF) for International Cooperation in Beijing. China could learn from Indonesia on how to better deal with countries that borrow money for infrastructure projects.\nIn his speech at the forum on Wednesday, President Jokowi told China, as the lender, as wel as borrowing countries, that Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) projects \"must be based on the principle of equal and mutually beneficial partnership, and equipped with careful planning.\"&nbsp;\nPresident Jokowi was reflecting on Indonesia's experience in building the Whoosh high-speed railway (HSR), which is part of the BRI. Jokowi underscored the necessity for the \"Use of a transparent funding system, absorption of local workers and utilization of domestic products.\"\n\"And avoid making the fiscal condition more difficult,\" the President said.\nDuring their bilateral meeting, President Jokowi and President Xi jointly inaugurated the operation of the HSR, which began operations early this month.\nChina won the tender for the project in September 2015, and expected to finish the US$ 6.07 billion project by 2019. The project, however, was delayed four years, and the&nbsp;cost overrun ballooned by at least 20 percent.&nbsp;\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nChina Daily\n&nbsp;quoted President Xi in response to the completion of the flagship project, asking \"the two sides to leverage their successful experience, ensure the railway's high-quality operation and develop an economic corridor centered around the rail line.\"\nExcept for his soft criticism of China, Jokowi failed to take advantage of his meeting with Xi to tell the leader of the world\u2019s second largest economy that China should not repeat the mistakes Japan committed in its early years as a lender.\nTo a certain extent, we can compare China\u2019s extension of loans to developing nations with Japan's aggressiveness in providing overseas development assistance, investment and industrial products into Southeast Asian countries, especially Indonesia, in the 1960s and 70s.\nWhen Japanese Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka visited Jakarta, anti-Japanese riots welcomed him on Jan. 15, 1974. The unrest, known as the Malari, short for Malapetaka 15 Januari (The Jan. 15 Disaster), was a response to Japan's economic domination. Similar protests also occurred in Manila and Bangkok but on a much smaller scale.\nThe Jakarta riots shocked the former colonial master, which quickly learned not to repeat such blunders. Japan drastically changed its approach toward Indonesia after the Malari incident.\nHowever, Japan\u2019s role as a major lender remained unchanged; it even became Indonesia's largest debtor for decades. Now Japan remains a source of loans and investment for Indonesia, although not as much as in the past.\nIn a close collaboration with the United States through the World Bank and Japan's control of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), which started in 1966, Tokyo played a leading role in Indonesia's economic development until the Asian financial crisis devastated Indonesia and forced Soeharto to end his 32-year dictatorship.&nbsp;&nbsp;\nPresident Xi vowed on Wednesday to learn from the mistakes China had committed as a new but aggressive global lender in the last 10 years.\nThe Chinese leader also showed off the tremendous impacts of Chinese-funded infrastructure projects in accelerating development in the loan recipient countries.&nbsp;\n\"What has been achieved in the past 10 years demonstrates that the Belt and Road cooperation is on the right side of history. It represents the advancing of our times and the right path forward,\" Xi emphasized.\n\"Debt trap\" threats, however, have haunted China's BRI projects across Asia and Africa since President Xi launched the economic and investment diplomacy in 2013. Beijing was accused of injecting billions of dollars into infrastructure projects in developing countries, including Indonesia, in a bid to control strategic access, such as a port in Sri Lanka, if the borrowers defaulted on their debts.\nHowever, critics often ignore the fact that in the event of a default, it is not only the borrowers who are impacted by the failures but also the lenders. China reportedly has lost billions of dollars, which is alarming for the Chinese economy, because of the debt defaults. That\u2019s why, in his speech, President Xi hinted at a continued funding of mega infrastructure projects overseas, albeit with more prudence. He said China would not extend loans without prior comprehensive feasibility studies and consultation with the loan recipients.\nWhen Soeharto took over from Sukarno in 1966, he immediately went to the World Bank, and the ADB.&nbsp;The World Bank initiated the establishment of the Inter-Government Group on Indonesia (IGGI), with the Netherlands leading the consortium.\nUntil 1992, the IGGI played a dominant role in Indonesia\u2019s economic development. Bilaterally, Japan was Indonesia\u2019s biggest lender. In July of that year, Soeharto demanded that the World Bank dissolve the IGGI because he was so outraged by what he perceived as the \"colonial behavior\" of then IGGI chairman Jan Pronk.\nThe IGGI was replaced by the Consultative Group for Indonesia (CGI), which did not include the Netherlands. The World Bank directly managed the new consortium.\nIn 2007, then President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono bade farewell to the CGI.\nChina Daily\nreported that President Xi announced eight major steps China will take to support the joint pursuit of high-quality Belt and Road cooperation, including efforts to build a multidimensional Belt and Road connectivity network, support an open economy, promote green development and advance scientific and technological innovation.\nAccording to Reuters, Xi is pushing to make the BRI smaller and greener and to move from big-ticket projects like dams to high-tech ones such as digital finance and e-commerce platforms. The BRI will also focus more on issues like peace, climate change, energy crises and artificial intelligence (AI), among other areas, according to a Chinese government white paper released last week.\nUnfortunately, President Jokowi did not bring up Indonesia's experience as a recipient of Japanese loans in the past. Like China, Japan required its borrowers to follow its wishes at least in the 1960s and 70s. President Xi may need a new perspective, different from that of Japan.\n***\nThe writer is a senior editor at\nThe Jakarta Post.\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Article\nTrump says anyone investing $1 billion in US will receive expedited permits\nThe sources of Japanese resilience\nXi says trade war with US will have 'no winners'\nRule of law first\nBali airport initiator signs HoA with Chinese company\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nMore in Opinion\nView more\nAcademia\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo\u2019s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nEntertainment\n'Astro Bot' wins highest award at Oscars of video games\nPolitics\nIndonesia to pardon tens of thousands including Papua activists\nAcademia\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?",

The two leaders announced their agreement to raise bilateral relations to a comprehensive strategic partnership. (AFP)\nT\nimor-Leste President Jose Ramos Horta could not help himself from deriding the Australian government and media for suspecting the young republic of intending to build a military pact with China following their Comprehensive Strategic Partnership agreement signed by Prime Minister Xanana Gusmao and Chinese President Xi Jinping in Hangzhou, China, on Sept. 23.\nIn two separate interviews with Reuters and\nThe Guardian\n, the 1996 Nobel Peace Prize co-laureate vehemently denied that the partnership would include a military pact that would grant the Chinese military access to Timor-Leste, a close neighbor of Indonesia.&nbsp;\nRamos Horta told Reuters six days after the historic agreement that the two countries did not discuss military cooperation, and instead focused on upgrading diplomatic ties. Australia, Indonesia and other ASEAN members Singapore and Malaysia \u201ccould sleep at peace\", he said, because the agreement would not turn Timor-Leste into a threat to its neighbors.\n\"Timor-Leste is not going to be a nuisance, a concern in terms of security,\" Ramos Horta said when asked about the partnership agreement.\nIt is somewhat surprising that the Timor-Leste leader named Indonesia, Singapore and Malaysia, although they had never expressed concerns about the agreement.&nbsp;Indonesia, for one, has been silent about the Xanana-Xi summit and the partnership agreement.\nBy contrast, the Australian government and media openly expressed strong suspicions that Timor-Leste would follow in the footsteps of Solomon Islands, which formed a military pact with China in July last year.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nWith its economic might, Australia has done a lot to help its Pacific neighbors generously, but some of them have complained that Canberra, a self-proclaimed deputy sheriff of Washington, has acted as a colonial master instead.\nTherefore, when China came, they found a weapon to teach Australia and the United States a lesson. As if they, like David, discovered a slingshot and rock to kill Goliath.\nAccording to Reuters, US President Joe Biden was disappointed when Solomon Islands Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare gave the Pacific Islands Forum Summit held at the White House a miss last month. Vanuatu Prime Minister Sato Kilman followed suit, citing a more pressing domestic agenda.\nAt first glance, the closer relationship between Timor-Leste and China today reminds me of circumstances that prompted Indonesia to invade the former Portuguese colony with the full blessing from the US and Australia in 1975.&nbsp;\nBack then, at the peak of the Cold War, Soeharto worried that the communists would control East Timor. Now China, a communist state, just inked a strategic partnership agreement with Timor-Leste, which shares Nusa Tenggara Island with Indonesia.&nbsp;&nbsp;\nIt would make sense if some parties in Indonesia share Australia's concerns about China\u2019s growing influence in Timor-Leste, although the geopolitical landscape of 1975 differs significantly from today\u2019s.&nbsp;\nAfter the fall of Soeharto in 1998, Indonesia accepted a United Nations-sanctioned referendum in 1999, which resulted in Timor-Leste\u2019s independence from Indonesia. The Indonesian military and its proxy militia groups launched attacks and forced an exodus to reject the separation of the territory from the republic. The rampant human rights violations in East Timor put Indonesia in the hall of shame among the global community.\nNow Indonesia chooses soft power diplomacy, using its role as the de-facto leader of ASEAN to push the admission of Timor-Leste into the regional grouping to ensure that all nations in Southeast Asia join the bloc. President Joko \u201cJokowi\u201d Widodo hopes Timor-Leste will be accepted as a full member of ASEAN before he ends his term in October next year.\nIndonesia has long been dealing with the Pacific nations because of their support for the independence of Papua. They, too, were staunch supporters of East Timor\u2019s independence from Indonesia.&nbsp;\nXanana exacerbated the awkward ties between Timor-Leste and ASEAN when he threatened to withdraw the country\u2019s bid to join ASEAN unless the regional grouping could force Myanmar's military junta to hand over the power it grabbed in a coup against the democratically elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi in February 2021.&nbsp;&nbsp;\nSome ASEAN members that were initially reluctant to accept Timor-Leste, like Singapore, could use Xanana\u2019s threat to justify ASEAN\u2019s move to delay Timor-Leste\u2019s accession into the regional bloc.\nIn Australia, many have shared their frustration with the smaller and ungrateful neighbors for choosing to play the China card to retaliate against their \"blood-sucking colonial master\".\n\"Imagined Chinese ghosts in Australia mainstream and rightwing media,\" Ramos Horta said over WhatsApp. \"Should we wear badges proclaiming our enduring love for Australia? But even then, would the overjealous Australian media stop accusing us, poor Timor-Leste, of being ungrateful [and] pro-China?\" Ramos Horta said in a WhatsApp interview with\nThe Guardian\n.\nXanana and Xi signed the agreement during their bilateral meeting in Hangzhou, China, on Sept. 23.\nXinhua news agency published the full text of the two leaders\u2019 15-point statement afterward.\nPoint 1 states that \"The two sides decided to elevate bilateral relations to a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership\".\nIn point 2, the leaders are \"Looking to the future, and the two nations will establish a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership to lead concrete cooperation in various fields and promote the well-being of the two countries and two peoples to make a greater contribution to regional and global peace, stability and development\".\nIt is point 10 that has sparked concern in Canberra and Washington. It says: \"The two nations agreed to enhance high-level military exchanges, strengthen cooperation in areas such as personnel training, equipment technology, the conduct of joint exercises and training.\nRamos Horta and Xanana realize that the country's huge oil and gas reserves are the only assets that can lift it out of poverty. But Australia is too selfish and greedy and refuses to give Timor-Leste a fairer share of the oil and gas revenue.\nNow China is offering a more generous share of oil and gas profits, which has shocked Australia.\nIndonesia knows it cannot do much to prevent China from pulling Timor-Leste closer. However, Jakarta believes that admitting Dili into ASEAN is the best way to counter China's influence in Timor-Leste.\n***\nThe writer is senior editor at&nbsp;\nThe Jakarta Post\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Article\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nMalaysia urges Chinese firms to avoid using it to dodge US tariffs\nMajor Canadian media sue ChatGPT in case potentially worth billions\nHow Indonesia can become a semiconductor powerhouse\nTimor Leste fights new battles 25 years after independence vote\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nMore in Opinion\nView more\nAcademia\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo\u2019s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nEntertainment\n'Astro Bot' wins highest award at Oscars of video games\nPolitics\nIndonesia to pardon tens of thousands including Papua activists\nAcademia\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?",

There is a risk that expanding the line to Surabaya will exacerbate the financial burden that may eventually plunge the country into a debt trap.\nWe agree with Jokowi\u2019s argument that the 800-kilometer track connecting Jakarta and Surabaya will accelerate mobility. A Jakarta-Surabaya HSR would cut the travel time between the country's two largest cities from 10-13 hours to only four hours.\nIn his remarks, the President said he would receive the complete feasibility study on extending the HSR to Surabaya within two weeks, and the decision on the project extension will depend on the feasibility study.\nIt would make the most sense if PT Kereta Cepat Indonesia China (KCIC), the consortium that operates the Whoosh HSR, gets the priority in the tender to build the line bound for Surabaya. The fact that China is Indonesia's largest and most important trading partner and investment source should also be taken into consideration.\nAfter numerous delays, Jokowi officiated the railway, which was recently named \"Whoosh\", on Monday in a launch event in which he, First Lady Iriana, various cabinet ministers and other guests rode on the HSR.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nBehind the merriment of the long-awaited event, however, we should remember the inconvenient truth of the flagship project, dubbed one of Jokowi\u2019s legacies.\nThe 142-km railway had an initial cost of US$6.07 billion and was planned to be completed within four years of September 2015, when Jokowi decided to award the project to China instead of Japan, which had submitted its feasibility study and financing scheme.\nIn 2014, Japan offered to cover 75 percent of the cost in long-term and soft loans. The project was estimated to cost $6.2 billion. Its interest rate was just 0.1 percent, and the loan term was 40 years. Repayment would start 11 years after the railway began operations.&nbsp;\nJokowi chose China because he disliked Japan's government-to-government financing scheme, and preferred China\u2019s business-to-business system. In the end, however, taxpayers will pay a high price for the pride of being the first ASEAN country to operate an HSR.\nThe project was completed four years behind schedule, resulting in a more than 20 percent overrun cost. Therefore, the government bowed to China's demand to provide a government guarantee for the project loan, which is precisely the reason why Jokowi rejected Japan\u2019s proposal.\nNow that the railway has been launched, Jokowi should reflect on what went wrong with the project. As we have learned from the Whoosh HSR gaffe, the stakes are too high for us to realize the railway extension unless a team is assigned to comprehensively evaluate the project.\nWe call on the President to exercise restraint and avoid making a rushed decision such as extending the HSR to Surabaya before such a team completes its work.\nWe also urge the President to demand a complete feasibility study and detailed financing scheme, and to consult not only his ministers but also experts to make sure the extension project would not lead Indonesia into a debt trap.\nHowever, considering that President Jokowi will end his second and final term in about a year, it would be much wiser if he lets the next government decide on the Jakarta-Surabaya HSR project.\nIn his final year of presidency, Jokowi should focus on continuing the construction of the Nusantara Capital City (IKN), another one of his legacies.\nWe cannot afford to repeat the mistakes committed in the Whoosh HSR. As the saying goes, even a donkey doesn't fall in the same hole twice.\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Article\nMount Fuji photo spot to get new fences to curb jaywalking\nPublic works minister ready to provide employees to IKN Authority\nPrabowo to appoint Basuki as IKN Authority head\nInvestors flock to build golf courses in Nusantara, minister says\nSurabaya administration, private sector unite to preserve environment in Old Town cleanup\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nMore in Opinion\nView more\nAcademia\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo\u2019s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nEntertainment\n'Astro Bot' wins highest award at Oscars of video games\nPolitics\nIndonesia to pardon tens of thousands including Papua activists\nAcademia\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?",

For ASEAN leaders, such a noncommittal stand is justifiable due to their heavy dependence on the world's second-largest economy and differences in view among them.\nThe China map was a distraction, but the ASEAN leaders managed to discuss in depth substantial issues, such as upgrading the ASEAN Secretariat to a more powerful institution, namely the ASEAN Headquarters. They also agreed to indefinitely maintain the isolation of Myanmar's military junta from all ASEAN official meetings.\nIn the 165-point Chairman Statement, issued after the leaders concluded their biannual summit in Jakarta on Tuesday, ASEAN\u2019s resolve on the South China Sea is formulated in points 157 and 158 of the statement. The leaders avoided making reference to the new map, released just one week before the regional leaders met with their partners, such as the United States, Canada, China, Japan, South Korea and Australia. Neither did they name China in the statement.\nChina\u2019s new version of the national map includes the South China Sea and its disputed borders with India, as it has done since 2006, to rectify what Beijing previously referred to as \"problematic maps\" that it claims misrepresent its territorial borders. The new map is seen as a show of force against the neighbors and countries whose interests were affected by Beijing's unilateral claim.\nThe leaders pointed out in the statement that they&nbsp;discussed the situation in the South China Sea, during which \"some ASEAN member states expressed concerns over the land reclamation, activities, serious incidents in the area, including actions that put the safety of all persons at risk, damage to the marine environment, which has eroded trust and confidence, increased tensions and may undermine peace, security and stability in the region\".\nThe leaders renewed calls for the need&nbsp;\n\"\nto pursue peaceful resolution of disputes by the universally recognized principles of international law, including the 1982 UNCLOS [United Nations Convention on the Laws of the Sea]\".\nMany expected the regional leaders, including President Joko \"Jokowi\" Widodo as the chair, to show their courage and stand against China's unilateral claim, as silence will not change anything for the better.&nbsp;\nFour ASEAN members \u2013 Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam \u2013 also claim small parts of the resource-rich South China Sea, while China claims nearly the whole high seas. The UN does not recognize China's territorial sovereignty claim.\nIndonesia is not a claimant, but as China includes the Natuna waters in its nine-dash line map, it is just a matter of time before the two countries will become embroiled in conflict, more than just minor skirmishes in Indonesia's exclusive economic zone.\nJapanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, US Vice President Kamala Harris, Australian Prime Minister Antony Albanese and South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol expressed support for ASEAN\u2019s concern about the South China Sea, given their interest in ensuring freedom and safety of navigation in the disputed waters.\nIn this regard, Premier Li Qiang emphasized China's importance as the largest trading partner for the regional grouping. \"As long as we keep to the right path, no matter what storm may come, China-ASEAN cooperation will be as firm as ever and press ahead against all odds,\" Li said on Wednesday.\nASEAN needs a stable and peaceful region where no country can force its will against the others. The 10-member regional grouping has therefore insisted on playing a central role in implementing its Indo-Pacific outlook.\nAll agreed, including the US and China, that although they have their own strategic projection of the region. The multilateral forum like the East Asia Summit, which traditionally follows the ASEAN summit, is and will always be an important confidence-building mechanism for the bloc to keep all players in the Indo-Pacific, including the big powers, advancing cooperation, rather than confrontation.\nASEAN\u2019s soft approach to China, while perhaps clumsy, is part of realpolitik.

It had been billed as a key forum for convening the region\u2019s powers.\nRepeat success\nSome leaders were notably absent from the EAS, with US Vice President Kamala Harris attending on behalf of US President Joe Biden, who had opted out of the ASEAN Summit but is scheduled to attend a summit of the Group of 20 (G20) biggest economies in India later this week.\nChinese President Xi Jinping was also absent, sending Chinese Premier Li Qiang to attend in his stead. Russian President Vladimir Putin sent veteran top diplomat Sergey Lavrov to the ASEAN meetings.\nAlso present as guests of the chair were the leaders of the Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA) and of the Pacific Islands Forum (PIF), Bangladesh and the Cook Islands, respectively.\nMany East Asia watchers feared the summit would be a stage where global cooperation would fall by the wayside as national and regional interests collided.\nBut Indonesia was determined to turn down the heat in an effort to repeat its successful G20 presidency last year, which was almost derailed by divisions over the war in Ukraine.\nEarlier at the summit\u2019s opening, Jokowi warned that every nation carries \u201can equally great responsibility\u201d to create peace, stability and prosperity in the region, as well as to refrain from creating new conflicts, tensions and wars.\nIn his closing speech, the President called on all participants to turn the Indo-Pacific into a \u201ctheater of peace and inclusivity\u201d, underscoring Indonesia\u2019s approach of navigating rivalries in search of collaboration.\n\u201cThis is the key foundation for ASEAN to deliver a better future for its people and the world. This is the essence of Indonesia\u2019s chairmanship, to make ASEAN matter as an epicenter of growth,\u201d Jokowi told fellow leaders before passing on the baton of the chairmanship over to Laos.\n\u2018Concrete\u2019 deliverables\nAt the close of the event, Jokowi boasted ASEAN\u2019s ability to issue 90 outcome documents and a raft of \u201cconcrete\u201d agreements with its dialogue partners, including a joint commitment from China, South Korea and Japan to help develop Southeast Asia\u2019s electric vehicle (EV) ecosystem.\nHe also touted the success of hosting the first ASEAN Indo-Pacific Forum that resulted in 93 projects worth some US$38 billion that \u201care beneficial for the people\u201d.\nSeparately, United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres expressed his appreciation for ASEAN\u2019s vital role in building \u201cbridges of understanding\u201d in the world.\n\u201cASEAN\u2019s convening power, commitment to dialogue and experience in conflict prevention are crucial pillars of stability,\u201d Guterres told leaders of ASEAN in remarks for the ASEAN-UN Summit on Thursday.\nHowever, some experts argue that the many statements ASEAN produced at the summit will not go far without actual implementation and continued solidarity in ASEAN.\nDafri Agussalim, executive director of Gadjah Mada University\u2019s ASEAN Studies Center, said that while Indonesia\u2019s achievement of coaxing its partners to agree on statements and declarations was commendable, they were still \u201csoft rules\u201d that still depend on ASEAN\u2019s ability to improve its bargaining position with major powers.\n\u201cOne way to do that is by strengthening solidarity and cohesiveness within ASEAN, but we know that the bloc is currently not in a good condition to do that,\u201d Dafri told\nThe Jakarta Post\non Thursday.\nHe pointed to ASEAN\u2019s inability to resolve the Myanmar coup crisis or negotiations for a Code of Conduct (CoC) in the South China Sea, which continue to drag on.\n\u201cHow can we even settle issues involving other countries if ASEAN\u2019s consensus, solidarity and centrality have not even been reached internally?\u201d Dafri asked.

(JP/Deni Ghifari)\nI\nn November, President\nPrabowo Subianto\nvisited China, the United States, Peru, Brazil, the United Kingdom and United Arab Emirates (UAE)&nbsp;to strengthen bilateral and multilateral ties, highlighting Indonesia's growing influence in Asia and the Americas.\nAs 2025 approaches, the global landscape remains multipolar, with rising US-China&nbsp;tensions. Following the Non-Aligned Movement, Indonesia pursues an independent foreign policy prioritizing its national interests. Its strategic position along key maritime trade routes enhances its role in regional stability and global commerce.\nWhile China aims to reduce competitors' influence, Indonesia leverages its relationship with China to negotiate with the US and other advanced economies. However, Indonesia must carefully engage with China to protect its security and sovereignty. President Prabowo has reiterated his commitment to cooperation with China, but this evolving dynamic has overshadowed US diplomatic efforts. For a more effective approach, the US should reassess its policies toward Indonesia and focus on building strong economic partnerships.\nIn recent years, Indonesia has fundamentally redefined its maritime strategy,&nbsp;particularly under former president Joko \u201cJokowi\u201d Widodo\u2019s administration, enhancing its role in the Indo-Pacific with a strategic naval policy. This evolution positions Indonesia as a vital player in regional security and governance.\nAs the US and Indonesia celebrate 75 years of diplomatic ties, their relationship has evolved into a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership (CSP), reinforcing cooperation in addressing global challenges. This partnership is crucial for stability and prosperity, aligning with Indonesia's strategic goals through initiatives like the Indo-Pacific&nbsp;Economic Framework (IPEF). Together, they aim to strengthen maritime security and foster sustainable economic development, paving the way for a resilient future for the region.\nOn Nov. 12, during a formal meeting in Washington, DC, US President Joe Biden and President Prabowo&nbsp;discussed strategic initiatives to build a strong and lasting partnership. They emphasized the critical need to strengthen bilateral defense collaboration to improve regional and global security. A major focus of their discussions was enhancing advanced maritime security capabilities and coordinating operations to combat illegal transnational organized crime.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nThey also placed emphasis on developing integrated intelligence-sharing protocols and creating joint operational frameworks to effectively address emerging security challenges.\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Article\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?\nStop with the LGBTQ scapegoating\nRussia teams up with BRICS to create AI alliance\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nMore in Opinion\nView more\nAcademia\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo\u2019s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nPolitics\nIndonesia to pardon tens of thousands including Papua activists\nAcademia\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?\nAcademia\nStop with the LGBTQ scapegoating",

It is precisely the advanced solutions that Russian scientists are currently working on,\" Putin told an AI conference in Moscow.&nbsp;\n\"We invite scientists from all over the world to join in the collaboration,\" he added.\nWestern sanctions intended to restrict Russia's access to the technologies it needs to sustain its war against Ukraine have resulted in the world's major producers of microchips halting exports to Russia, sorely limiting its AI ambitions.\nRussia's dominant lender Sberbank is spearheading AI development in Russia, but&nbsp;Sberbank CEO German Gref acknowledged in 2023 that graphics processing units (GPUs), the microchips that underpin AI development, were the trickiest hardware for Russia to replace.&nbsp;\nOn Wednesday, the bank said national AI associations from BRICS members Brazil, China, India and South Africa, but also from Serbia,&nbsp;Indonesia&nbsp;and other non-BRICS countries, had joined the AI Alliance Network.\nIt said the network would facilitate joint research into technology and AI regulation, and&nbsp;provide opportunities for AI products&nbsp;to be sold in&nbsp;member countries' markets.\nThe United States and China are the world's top AI powers, and US President-elect Donald Trump has named a \"White House AI and Crypto Czar\" to help ensure the United States remains the richest and most technologically advanced power in the world.\nBut Putin's move to ally with China could change the dynamics of the AI race.\nRussia is one of 10 countries, including the US, China, Britain and Israel, that are developing their own generative AI models. The Yakov and Partners consultancy, run by former McKinsey employees in Moscow, says this gives it the potential to become a much more significant player.\nRussia sees the use of AI technologies across all sectors adding 11.2 trillion roubles ($109 billion) to gross domestic product in 2030, compared to 0.2 trillion roubles ($1.9 billion) in 2023.&nbsp;\nIts AI strategy also says that 80 percent of all Russian workers should have AI skills by 2030, compared with 5 percent in 2023, while AI investment should grow seven-fold to 850 billion roubles.&nbsp;\nSberbank, which has developed a generative AI model called GigaChat, and technology leader Yandex, with its YandexGPT model, dominate Russia's domestic AI market.&nbsp;\nRussia currently ranks 31st of 83 countries by AI implementation, innovation and investment on UK-based Tortoise Media's Global AI Index, well behind not only the United States and China but also fellow BRICS members India and Brazil.&nbsp;\nStanford University's AI vibrancy tool, which evaluates 36 countries based on 42 AI indicators including research and development, ranks Russia 29th.\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Article\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nChina\u2019s fast-changing economic adjustments\nChinese guards on the ground in Myanmar could go disastrously wrong\nTrump's unorthodox cabinet picks test party loyalty\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nMore in World\nView more\nEurope\nUS announces new arms aid package for Ukraine worth $500 million\nMiddle East and Africa\nUS says Israel is acting in Syria for its own defence\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia welcomes UNGA resolution on immediate ceasefire in Gaza\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo\u2019s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nPolitics\nIndonesia to pardon tens of thousands including Papua activists\nAcademia\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?\nAcademia\nStop with the LGBTQ scapegoating",

(Reuters/Dilara Senkaya)\nJ\nust over a year ago, China gave Bashar al-Assad and his wife a warm welcome during their six-day visit to the country, offering the former Syrian leader a rare break from years of international isolation since the start of a civil war in 2011.\nAs the couple attended the Asian Games, President Xi Jinping vowed to support Assad in \"opposing external interference\" and in Syria's rebuilding, while his wife Asma was feted in Chinese media.\nBut the abrupt end to the rule of the authoritarian leader so explicitly backed by Xi only last year has dealt a blow to China's diplomatic ambitions in the Middle East and exposed the limits of its strategy in the region, analysts say.\nA coalition of rebels seized Syria's capital Damascus on Sunday after a lightning offensive that toppled&nbsp;Assad's regime and ended his family's 50-year dynasty.\n\"There's been a lot of an exaggerated sense of China's ability to shape political outcomes in the region,\" said Jonathan Fulton, a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council.\nWhile the collapse of the Assad regime was seen reducing the influence in the Arab world of his main backers, Iran and Russia, it was also a blow for China's global ambitions, said Fulton.\n\"A lot of what (China has) been doing internationally has relied on support with those countries, and their inability to prop up their biggest partner in the Middle East says quite a lot about their ability to do much beyond the region.\"\nTackling Hotspots&nbsp;\nAfter China brokered a deal between long-time rivals Saudi Arabia and Iran in 2023, Chinese media praised Beijing's rising profile in a neighbourhood long dominated by Washington.&nbsp;\nWang Yi, China's top diplomat, said the country would play a constructive role in handling global \"hotspot issues\".\nChina also brokered a truce between Fatah, Hamas and other rival Palestinian factions earlier this year and has made repeated calls for a ceasefire in Gaza.\nBut despite bringing Middle Eastern leaders to Beijing and rounds of \"shuttle diplomacy\" by its Middle Eastern envoy, Zhai Jun, in the months since, Palestinians have not formed a unity government and the conflict in Gaza continues.\n\"Assad's sudden downfall is not a scenario Beijing wishes to see,\" said Fan Hongda, a Middle East scholar at Shanghai International Studies University. \"China prefers a more stable and independent Middle East, as chaos or a pro-American orientation in the region does not align with China's interests.\"&nbsp;\nThe response by China's foreign ministry to Assad's fall has been muted, focusing on the safety of Chinese nationals and calling for a \"political solution\" to restore stability in Syria as soon as possible.\nMinistry of foreign affairs spokesperson, Mao Ning, on Monday appeared to leave an opening for engagement with the future government: \"China's friendly relations with Syria are for all Syrian people,\" she said.\nChinese experts and diplomats say Beijing will now bide its time before recognising a new government in Damascus.&nbsp;\nIt could use its expertise and financial muscle to support reconstruction, they say, but its commitments are likely to be limited because China has sought to minimise financial risks overseas in recent years.\nSyria joined China's flagship Belt and Road Initiative in 2022, but there have been no significant investments by Chinese firms since, partly due to sanctions.&nbsp;\nChina is \"not really able to fundamentally replace the West either as an economic partner, or diplomatic or military force in the region,\" said Bill Figueroa, assistant professor at the University of Groningen and an expert in China-Middle East relations.\n\"China in 2024 has way less money than China in 2013 - 2014, when the BRI was launched,\" Figueroa said. There is \"an obvious reassessment going on in the direction of safer investments and reducing China's risks overall,\" he added.\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Article\nUN General Assembly calls for 'unconditional' Gaza ceasefire\nPentagon chief urges 'close consultation' between Israel and US on Syria\nIndonesia must regain credibility as an honest broker\nTrump\u2019s second term could deepen Indonesia-China relations\nIndonesia urges citizens to exercise caution during transition of power in Syria\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nMore in World\nView more\nEurope\nUS announces new arms aid package for Ukraine worth $500 million\nMiddle East and Africa\nUS says Israel is acting in Syria for its own defence\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia welcomes UNGA resolution on immediate ceasefire in Gaza\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo\u2019s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nEntertainment\n'Astro Bot' wins highest award at Oscars of video games\nPolitics\nIndonesia to pardon tens of thousands including Papua activists\nAcademia\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?",

(AFP/Tang Chhin Sothy)\nB\narely 10 days before the ASEAN and Related Summits in Vientiane, on Oct. 9-11, China agreed to unleash a stimulus package of US$1.3 trillion.\nAlmost instantly, the Hong Kong Stock Exchange began to experience the fastest bull run the stock market has ever seen, compelling traders in Hong Kong, Shenzhen and Shanghai to cancel their week-long vacation that was starting on Oct. 1.\nThe leaders of Australia, Canada, the European Union, the United States and the United Kingdom, all of whom had flown into ASEAN to meet with various leaders, especially Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim who will lead ASEAN all through 2025, could not have been unimpressed with China's impeccable timing.\nTo be sure, the Nomura Research Center in Japan warned that a huge stimulus that is too big and too fast can potentially trigger a bubble. The fact is China prompted all the countries that were concerned with the developments in the South China Sea to take a more nuanced approach toward Beijing too.\nWhile the Philippines was adamant that China's maritime behavior must change, Vietnam was surreptitiously quiet. In turn, China did not trouble the waters openly in ASEAN.\nThis despite Vietnam's attempt to enlarge several features in the Paracel Islands based on reclaimed land that China had originally pioneered. If anything, China and ASEAN all concurred with Anwar's assertion that all sensitive issues should be discussed bilaterally, if need be, multilaterally, but more than anything else, behind closed doors.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nPerhaps issues such as the Rohingya and southern Thailand need to be addressed in the same manner to make them practical for resolution.\nWhile Anwar promised that Malaysia's chairmanship of ASEAN would focus on resilience and sustainability, a theme that has been around since 2019 when Thailand was then the chair, Anwar could not have ignored the importance of 2026 too.\nThe latter will be the year when the Philippines is the chair of ASEAN; followed by Singapore in 2027. For Anwar 2026 and 2027 are important as he has the option to call the 16th general election in Malaysia to get a second tenure of another five years in office, having become the 10th prime minister of Malaysia on Nov. 24, 2022.\nIndeed, Anwar told MNBC two weeks prior to the summit that in order to be a \"statesman, one cannot ignore the importance of being a politician.\"\nAnwar was being candid. Politicians, especially a Muslim democrat, must know how to win elections; notwithstanding the fact that Anwar has a two-thirds electoral majority based on the support that has been pledged to the coalition government.\nWhat makes Anwar confident that he can ensure a strong and resilient ASEAN that extends not merely from the security of the member states' supply chain but can handle the tensions that emanate from the Taiwan Strait, the East China Sea and finally the South China Sea?\nA good way to understand the statecraft of Anwar is his deep belief in alliance building, sometimes even reaching out to countries that are deemed to be opposed by the Group of Seven and EU such as China, Russia and Iran; of which the last three can be plainly described as a triple axis.\nThis is where Anwar's strategic and economic statecraft is based on alliance building and a loose amalgamation with the axis of China, Russia and Iran has to be broken down into six levels of analysis.\nFirst and foremost, Malaysia under Anwar practices a dynamic yet quiescent diplomacy. Reliable sources have confirmed that Anwar did not try to build strong bridges with the US during the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Summit in November 2023 in San Francisco.\nIn California, Anwar was even willing to drop all mention of the war in Israel, hoping that this could reduce the tensions between Hamas, the Houthis and Hezbollah and Israel. If one were to examine the speech of Anwar at APEC, he did condemn violence from all sides in the Middle East.\nThis was not merely an overture to Washington, to which Anwar admits \"cumulatively the US remains the largest trading partner of Malaysia\u201d, and by extension ASEAN. The US has been in Southeast Asia for a long time since its first annexation of the Philippines in 1898.\nBut it is not necessarily Malaysia that wants the foreign direct investment (FDI) of the US. The whole of ASEAN wants it to complement its FDI from China, the EU and UK too.\nTo the degree, more relationships need to be built with the triple axis of China, Russia and Iran, of which Iran is increasingly a pivotal power that can decide the geopolitical stability of the world, Anwar has agreed to guide ASEAN beyond its old allies to reach out to BRICS too.\nSecondly, Anwar has also emphasized the importance of the ASEAN-Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) Plus China initiative. In October last year ASEAN already had one inaugural summit in Riyadh.\nGranted the existence of Malaysia's Look East Policy that includes China, Japan and South Korea. The latter became the comprehensive strategic partner of ASEAN in Laos, leaving Japan as the lone polity out for now.\nVery soon Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, if he leads the Liberal Democratic Party to another electoral victory in November, will want to join the ASEAN-GCC Summit.\nThird, Anwar did not leave out the importance of the EU. If anything, Anwar emphasized the criticality of ASEAN and the EU enhancing their mutual trade.\nThis would be music to the ear of Prime Minister Lawrence Wong of Singapore, whom Anwar will meet again in early December to consolidate the Johor-Singapore Economic and Financial Zone. Why would Singapore be pleased with Anwar? For the longest time since the mid-1990s, Singapore has always supported, even convened the first, Europe and ASEAN Meeting (ASEM).\nFourth, Anwar has called for the admission of Timor-Leste into ASEAN by 2025. As and when, Timor-Leste succeeds, after more than two decades of waiting as a mere observer, ASEAN will extend its reach into the South Pacific Forum (SPF), which gathers 16 Micronesian states.\nThe Indo-Pacific rivalry that is so important to the Quad (Australia, US, India and Japan) cannot expand its influence into the South Pacific without first consulting ASEAN, since Timor-Leste would be a key member of Southeast Asia.\nThe \"convening power\" of ASEAN, all of which adds up to the centrality of Southeast Asia to the great powers, will be enhanced by Anwar with the tacit and open endorsement of all countries.\nIn sum, all geopolitical strategies could come to naught if Malaysia, for that matter ASEAN, does not know how to tackle economic issues jointly.\nBut beyond the quadruple alliance cum axis strategy to allow ASEAN to engage with the Global South and Global North, Anwar has explained the necessity of enhancing the intra-regional trade of ASEAN. This is to go beyond the 25 percent threshold currently in place to attain a regional self-sufficiency to be the fourth-largest economy in the world by 2030.\nThis could potentially still see Anwar and Wong and soon-to-be-inaugurated president-elect\nPrabowo Subianto\nof Indonesia all remaining in office.\nWith Malaysia focused on digitalization, renewable energy and manufacturing as some of the key planks of its growth strategy, all of which are shared by other members of ASEAN, Anwar is not short of the strategic depth to be the major statesman of Southeast Asia in the first half of the 21st century.\n***\nThe writer is CEO of Strategic Pan-Indo Pacific Arena\n.\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Article\nFrench troubles won't undermine Europe\u2019s strong foundation\nTrump\u2019s second term could deepen Indonesia-China relations\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources\nConsumers upbeat on RI economy in November, but spending boost unlikely\nPutin\u2019s India visit aims to shape global multipolarity\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nMore in Opinion\nView more\nAcademia\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo\u2019s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nEntertainment\n'Astro Bot' wins highest award at Oscars of video games\nPolitics\nIndonesia to pardon tens of thousands including Papua activists\nAcademia\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?",

Japan's Nikkei surged 2.4 percent.\nHong Kong's Hang Seng Index similarly advanced 1.5 percent, while the mainland CSI300 blue-chip index reversed early losses to last trade 0.3 percent higher.\nAlso aiding sentiment, Bloomberg News reported on Thursday that China is considering injecting up to 1 trillion yuan (US$142.39 billion) of capital into its biggest state banks to increase their capacity to support the struggling economy.\nProspects\nEvery Monday\nWith exclusive interviews and in-depth coverage of the region's most pressing business issues, \"Prospects\" is the go-to source for staying ahead of the curve in Indonesia's rapidly evolving business landscape.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nIn the broader market, investors turned their attention to a raft of speeches from Federal Reserve policymakers later in the day, including remarks from Chair Jerome Powell, which could provide further clues on the US rate outlook.\nThe release of the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index - the Fed's preferred measure of inflation - is also due on Friday.\n\"I don't think the reaction will be excessive, but the direction will be there,\" said Jeff Ng, head of Asia macro strategy at SMBC, referring to Friday's data release. \"If let's say prices are sticky, then maybe that will slightly dampen expectations for a 50-basis-point [rate cut].\"\nMarkets are now pricing in a roughly 62 percent chance of a 50-basis-point (bp) cut at the Fed's November policy meeting and see a total of 77 basis points worth of cuts by the year end.\nShifting expectations of how aggressive the Fed would ease rates this year and next have in turn kept the dollar largely rangebound over the past month.\nIt was back on the front foot on Thursday, having fallen earlier in the week as China's slew of support measures boosted risk appetite and sent traders scooping up China-linked assets such as the Australian and New Zealand dollars.\nAnalysts said the greenback also drew additional support from month-end flows.\nThe Aussie was last 0.18 percent higher at $0.6835, while the kiwi eased 0.06 percent to $0.6257.\nAgainst the dollar, the euro and sterling retreated from their recent peaks to last trade at $1.1137 and $1.3324, respectively.\nThe offshore yuan ticked up 0.06 percent to 7.0277 per dollar, having briefly strengthened past the key psychological level of 7 per dollar in the previous session.\n\"While rate cuts should weigh on the RMB, this may be offset by equity inflows,\" said DBS analysts in a note.\n\"Still, China's economic outlook remains fragile, and sustained RMB gains are acceptable only if regional currencies continue their appreciation against the USD.\"\nIn commodities, oil prices edged up with Brent crude futures last 0.27 percent higher at $73.66 a barrel.

(Antara/Fikri Yusuf)\nA\nfter concluding the Indonesia-Africa Forum 2024 with billions in cooperation pledges, Indonesia needs to figure out if it is serious about pivoting its foreign policy, what the benefits of this move would be and to what extent Indonesia is in a better position to make the pivot compared to other contenders.\nThese details are not only important to African countries, but also to Indonesia\u2019s neighbors, other regions of the world and even the great powers \u2014 the United States and China. As such, I argue that Indonesia must stop treating forums as its key diplomatic performance indicators and instead craft a tailored grand strategy for the region.\nA focus on convening meetings has always been in Indonesia\u2019s diplomatic records. From the 1955 Asian African Conference to the 2024 Indonesia-Africa Forum, the country ostensibly believes that meetings can achieve two goals in one strike: generating concrete economic benefits and exercising leadership on the global stage.\nThrough a forum, Indonesia\u2019s meetings, incentives, conferences and exhibitions (MICE) sector can generate revenue from the visiting delegates and some of them may buy handmade souvenirs from the country\u2019s small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Through a forum, Indonesian leaders can shake hands with their counterparts from diverse African countries, taking photos that are then used as a measurement of progress.\nWhile this pragmatic paradigm is not unique to Indonesia, the country can absolutely do better considering its position as a growing economic powerhouse.\nFor starters, the seriousness of Indonesia\u2019s Africa pivot cannot be justified only by organizing a forum.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nAdequate resources and public awareness are crucial. Unfortunately, African countries are yet to enjoy these privileges from Indonesia.

(AFP/Adek Berry)\nT\nhe Third Plenary Session of the 20th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC), held in Beijing from July 15 to 18, marked a significant moment in China\u2019s political and economic landscape.\nThe communiqu\u00e9 issued at the conclusion of this session reaffirms the CPC's commitment to the ideological framework of President Xi Jinping and underscores a comprehensive strategy for China's modernization through deepened reforms. This strategy includes ambitious goals for economic development, governance and national security, reflecting China's commitment to becoming a leading global power.\nCentral to the session's outcomes is the reaffirmation of \u201cXi Jinping Thoughts on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era\u201d. This ideological cornerstone is presented as the guiding light for China's path forward, emphasizing Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, Deng Xiaoping Theory, the Theory of Three Represents and the Scientific Outlook on Development.\nThe synthesis of these doctrines into a cohesive framework illustrates an attempt to root modern policies in historical continuity, providing stability amid significant policy shifts. This ideological commitment aims to consolidate power within the CPC and reinforce Xi\u2019s position at the helm, ensuring alignment with the party\u2019s long-term vision.\nThe communiqu\u00e9 outlines a robust agenda for deepening reforms further to advance Chinese modernization. Key areas include building a high-standard socialist market economy, promoting high-quality economic development, advancing whole-process people's democracy and modernizing China\u2019s governance and national security systems. These goals are ambitious and aim to position China as a leading global power by mid-century.\nThe emphasis on \"promoting high-quality development\" and \"deepening supply-side structural reform\" acknowledges the need for economic recalibration. Shifting toward a more consumption-driven, innovation-based economy is necessary but challenging, requiring profound changes in industrial policy, financial regulation and labor markets.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nThe terms \"whole-process people's democracy\" and \"socialist rule of law\" reflect China's efforts to enhance governance efficiency and legitimacy, contributing to the country's overall stability and progress.\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Article\nTrump\u2019s second term could deepen Indonesia-China relations\nBali airport initiator signs HoA with Chinese company\nA new journey in China-Indonesia relationship: Building a shared future\nIDX Composite closes higher at 7,504.13 on Monday\nA Faustian bargain?

(AFP/Kenzaburo Fukuhara)\nB\ny hosting Xi Jinping on the last leg of the Chinese leader's European tour, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban will get a chance to tighten bonds between Beijing and its closest ally in the EU.\nXi began his trip earlier this week in France, a visit that was cordial but also highlighted tensions between Beijing and the EU over the war in Ukraine and global trade.\nAfter visiting Serbia, a non-EU partner, Xi will arrive in Budapest on Wednesday evening to cap his first European trip since 2019.\nXi can expect a warm welcome when he holds talks with Orban, who has bucked the European Union's official position to \"derisk\" relations with China.\n\"It is clearly a visit of historic significance,\" said Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto, noting that it was the first visit by a Chinese president in 20 years.\nOrban has been championing an \"Eastern opening\" foreign policy since his return to power in 2010, seeking closer economic ties to China, Russia and other Asian countries.\nThe nationalist premier remained committed to his strategy even as tensions between Western nations and Beijing increased over human rights violations, the Covid pandemic, trade and Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\nIn recent years, the Central European country of 9.6 million people has attracted a flood of major Chinese projects, mostly related to battery and electric vehicle (EV) manufacturing.\nHungary has become \"more valuable for Beijing both economically and politically\", said Tamas Matura, an associate professor at Corvinus University.\nIt is the EU's \"last explicitly and openly pro-China government\", Matura added.\nLooking to the East&nbsp;\nLast October, Orban was the sole EU leader to attend a summit for Xi's flagship Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) in Beijing.\nDuring the conference, Orban said Hungary was one of the \"proponents of connectivity, (who) reject the policy which promotes blocs\" amid \"talk of decoupling and derisking\".&nbsp;\n\"The relationship with Hungary is stable and reliable,\" Yan Xuetong, director of the Institute of International Studies at Tsinghua University, told AFP during a visit to Budapest.\n\"Chinese companies feel safe investing in the country, expecting their business won't be disturbed by unpleasant political developments,\" he added.\nSince Hungary began to promote itself as a global hub for EV manufacturing in 2022, several new Chinese businesses have sprung up all over the country.\nBattery manufacturer CATL is building its second European factory near the eastern city of Debrecen, while Chinese carmaker BYD is due to manufacture passenger cars in southern Szeged as early as next year.\nAccording to the Hungarian government, around 15 billion euros' worth of ongoing projects originate from the Asian country.\nIn return, Chinese companies benefit from tax breaks, a favourable regulatory environment and generous infrastructure subsidies.\nRaising concerns&nbsp;\nIn 2015, Hungary became the first European country to join the BRI, a controversial project to revive the Silk Road through global transport networks and infrastructure funded via Chinese loans.\nA high-speed railway project to connect Budapest and Belgrade is behind schedule.\nBilateral cooperation has flourished in other areas, with Budapest purchasing Chinese vaccines during the pandemic and promising to host the first Chinese university campus in the EU.\nIt recently also signed a security pact authorising Chinese police officers to patrol in Hungary alongside local authorities.\nWhile the government says Hungary is benefiting from its partnership with China, opposition parties have raised concerns over a lack of transparency, the environmental impact of battery factories and corruption.\n\"We are giving huge discounts for these projects, which place a huge financial burden on taxpayers... but only Orban's inner circle is getting richer,\" said Sandor Ronai of the left-wing Democratic Coalition.\nMoreover, China has repeatedly relied on Budapest \"to block or significantly water down some EU decisions, which were concerning to them\", said expert Matej Simalcik.\n\"The same logic could also apply to decision-making within NATO,\" he told AFP.\nA NATO member since 1999, Hungary has set itself apart from other allies by calling for an immediate ceasefire in the Ukraine war and denouncing what it called \"war fever\".\nSzijjarto, Hungary's foreign minister, said both countries are in \"absolute agreement\" over their approach to bring \"peace\" to the conflict.\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians

(AFP/STR)\nB\neijing's commerce minister dismissed as \"groundless\" US concerns that a surge of low-cost Chinese exports posed a risk to global markets, as Washington's Treasury chief on Monday wrapped up a visit aimed in part at addressing the issue.\nDuring the visit by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, Chinese officials have sounded a positive note that ties between the two countries are on more stable footing, with both sides agreeing to open channels for further talks on the issue of excess industrial capacity -- though differences clearly remain.\nThe US concern is that with Chinese government support creating more production capacity than global markets can absorb, a flood of cheap exports in key sectors like solar and electric vehicles could impact the growth of those industries elsewhere.\nBut commerce minister Wang Wentao said during a trip to Paris on Sunday that \"the accusations of 'overcapacity' by the United States and Europe are groundless\", state-run Xinhua news agency reported.&nbsp;\nWang said Chinese electric vehicle makers' rapid growth was due to innovation and established supply chains, not subsidies. &nbsp;\nHe added that Beijing would support businesses in defending their interests, Xinhua said.\nProspects\nEvery Monday\nWith exclusive interviews and in-depth coverage of the region's most pressing business issues, \"Prospects\" is

for industry. &nbsp;\nThe European Union has started a probe into Chinese electric car subsidies that could lead to tariffs on vehicles it believes are unfairly sold at a lower price, which Beijing last month condemned as \"protectionism\".\nYellen has brought up overcapacity repeatedly in talks with officials and business leaders in the southern city of Guangzhou and the capital Beijing.\nIn addition to tackling the issue with her counterpart Vice Premier He Lifeng over some 11 hours of engagement, she also raised it with Premier Li Qiang in a bid to bring the concerns to the highest levels of Chinese policymaking.\nAccording to Xinhua, Li told Yellen that Washington should view the matter of production capacity \"objectively\" and from a \"market-oriented\" perspective.\nHe added that the growth of China's new energy industry \"will make important contributions to the global green and low-carbon transition\", the readout of their bilateral meeting said.\nYellen, for her part, has acknowledged that \"this is a complicated issue that involves their entire macroeconomic and industrial strategy\".\n\"It's not going to be solved in an afternoon or a month,\" she earlier told reporters in Guangzhou.\nBut she said Chinese officials had \"heard that this is an important issue to us\" and one that will be critical to the bilateral relationship, as well as China's ties with other countries, going forward.\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS':

(JP/Deni Ghifari)\nI\nn November, President\nPrabowo Subianto\nvisited China, the United States, Peru, Brazil, the United Kingdom and United Arab Emirates (UAE)&nbsp;to strengthen bilateral and multilateral ties, highlighting Indonesia's growing influence in Asia and the Americas.\nAs 2025 approaches, the global landscape remains multipolar, with rising US-China&nbsp;tensions. Following the Non-Aligned Movement, Indonesia pursues an independent foreign policy prioritizing its national interests. Its strategic position along key maritime trade routes enhances its role in regional stability and global commerce.\nWhile China aims to reduce competitors' influence, Indonesia leverages its relationship with China to negotiate with the US and other advanced economies. However, Indonesia must carefully engage with China to protect its security and sovereignty. President Prabowo has reiterated his commitment to cooperation with China, but this evolving dynamic has overshadowed US diplomatic efforts. For a more effective approach, the US should reassess its policies toward Indonesia and focus on building strong economic partnerships.\nIn recent years, Indonesia has fundamentally redefined its maritime strategy,&nbsp;particularly under former president Joko \u201cJokowi\u201d Widodo\u2019s administration, enhancing its role in the Indo-Pacific with a strategic naval policy. This evolution positions Indonesia as a vital player in regional security and governance.\nAs the US and Indonesia celebrate 75 years of diplomatic ties, their relationship has evolved into a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership (CSP), reinforcing cooperation in addressing global challenges. This partnership is crucial for stability and prosperity, aligning with Indonesia's strategic goals through initiatives like the Indo-Pacific&nbsp;Economic Framework (IPEF). Together, they aim to strengthen maritime security and foster sustainable economic development, paving the way for a resilient future for the region.\nOn Nov. 12, during a formal meeting in Washington, DC, US President Joe Biden and President Prabowo&nbsp;discussed strategic initiatives to build a strong and lasting partnership. They emphasized the critical need to strengthen bilateral defense collaboration to improve regional and global security. A major focus of their discussions was enhancing advanced maritime security capabilities and coordinating operations to combat illegal transnational organized crime.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nThey also placed emphasis on developing integrated intelligence-sharing protocols and creating joint operational frameworks to effectively address emerging security challenges.\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Article\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?\nStop with the LGBTQ scapegoating\nRussia teams up with BRICS to create AI alliance\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nMore in Opinion\nView more\nAcademia\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo\u2019s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nEntertainment\n'Astro Bot' wins highest award at Oscars of video games\nPolitics\nIndonesia to pardon tens of thousands including Papua activists\nAcademia\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?",

(Reuters/Dilara Senkaya)\nJ\nust over a year ago, China gave Bashar al-Assad and his wife a warm welcome during their six-day visit to the country, offering the former Syrian leader a rare break from years of international isolation since the start of a civil war in 2011.\nAs the couple attended the Asian Games, President Xi Jinping vowed to support Assad in \"opposing external interference\" and in Syria's rebuilding, while his wife Asma was feted in Chinese media.\nBut the abrupt end to the rule of the authoritarian leader so explicitly backed by Xi only last year has dealt a blow to China's diplomatic ambitions in the Middle East and exposed the limits of its strategy in the region, analysts say.\nA coalition of rebels seized Syria's capital Damascus on Sunday after a lightning offensive that toppled&nbsp;Assad's regime and ended his family's 50-year dynasty.\n\"There's been a lot of an exaggerated sense of China's ability to shape political outcomes in the region,\" said Jonathan Fulton, a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council.\nWhile the collapse of the Assad regime was seen reducing the influence in the Arab world of his main backers, Iran and Russia, it was also a blow for China's global ambitions, said Fulton.\n\"A lot of what (China has) been doing internationally has relied on support with those countries, and their inability to prop up their biggest partner in the Middle East says quite a lot about their ability to do much beyond the region.\"\nTackling Hotspots&nbsp;\nAfter China brokered a deal between long-time rivals Saudi Arabia and Iran in 2023, Chinese media praised Beijing's rising profile in a neighbourhood long dominated by Washington.&nbsp;\nWang Yi, China's top diplomat, said the country would play a constructive role in handling global \"hotspot issues\".\nChina also brokered a truce between Fatah, Hamas and other rival Palestinian factions earlier this year and has made repeated calls for a ceasefire in Gaza.\nBut despite bringing Middle Eastern leaders to Beijing and rounds of \"shuttle diplomacy\" by its Middle Eastern envoy, Zhai Jun, in the months since, Palestinians have not formed a unity government and the conflict in Gaza continues.\n\"Assad's sudden downfall is not a scenario Beijing wishes to see,\" said Fan Hongda, a Middle East scholar at Shanghai International Studies University. \"China prefers a more stable and independent Middle East, as chaos or a pro-American orientation in the region does not align with China's interests.\"&nbsp;\nThe response by China's foreign ministry to Assad's fall has been muted, focusing on the safety of Chinese nationals and calling for a \"political solution\" to restore stability in Syria as soon as possible.\nMinistry of foreign affairs spokesperson, Mao Ning, on Monday appeared to leave an opening for engagement with the future government: \"China's friendly relations with Syria are for all Syrian people,\" she said.\nChinese experts and diplomats say Beijing will now bide its time before recognising a new government in Damascus.&nbsp;\nIt could use its expertise and financial muscle to support reconstruction, they say, but its commitments are likely to be limited because China has sought to minimise financial risks overseas in recent years.\nSyria joined China's flagship Belt and Road Initiative in 2022, but there have been no significant investments by Chinese firms since, partly due to sanctions.&nbsp;\nChina is \"not really able to fundamentally replace the West either as an economic partner, or diplomatic or military force in the region,\" said Bill Figueroa, assistant professor at the University of Groningen and an expert in China-Middle East relations.\n\"China in 2024 has way less money than China in 2013 - 2014, when the BRI was launched,\" Figueroa said. There is \"an obvious reassessment going on in the direction of safer investments and reducing China's risks overall,\" he added.\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Article\nUN General Assembly calls for 'unconditional' Gaza ceasefire\nPentagon chief urges 'close consultation' between Israel and US on Syria\nIndonesia must regain credibility as an honest broker\nTrump\u2019s second term could deepen Indonesia-China relations\nIndonesia urges citizens to exercise caution during transition of power in Syria\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nMore in World\nView more\nEurope\nUS announces new arms aid package for Ukraine worth $500 million\nMiddle East and Africa\nUS says Israel is acting in Syria for its own defence\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia welcomes UNGA resolution on immediate ceasefire in Gaza\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo\u2019s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nEntertainment\n'Astro Bot' wins highest award at Oscars of video games\nPolitics\nIndonesia to pardon tens of thousands including Papua activists\nAcademia\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?",

(AFP/Pool/Maxim Shipenkov)\nN\nearly three years after his last visit to India in December 2021, Russian President Vladimir Putin will be in New Delhi for the forthcoming reciprocal 23rd annual bilateral summit with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, pending the announcement of specific dates. Putin\u2019s visit will be at Modi\u2019s invitation, which was extended during their bilateral meeting on the sidelines of October\u2019s BRICS Summit in Kazan.\nThe two leaders had met earlier at the 22nd India-Russia summit, held on the sidelines of the Eastern Economic Forum in Russia in July. At that time, both sides reconfirmed their commitment to strengthen their \u201cspecial and privileged\u201d strategic partnership and its historical, time-tested and all-weather nature.\nThe upcoming summit is significant, as Putin\u2019s priority would be to advance multipolarity amid a rapidly changing global order from unipolar dominance to multipolar balance.\nThe declaration of the BRICS Summit in Kazan resembled a testament to building a fairer and more just world order, which will be represented by the voice of the Global South/global majority that remains marginalized in Western-centric international institutions.\nLike China, India is expected to be considered a civilizational state and an important partner in building a multipolar order in the emerging global balance of power led by Russia\u2019s initiative.\nRussian philosopher Alexander Dugin, whose ideas have much influence on the policies of Putin and Moscow, considers China, India and his country as civilizational states, rather than nation-states in the Westphalian model of international relations. For him, multipolarity should be based on dialogue among Russia, China and India as part of the Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa (BRICS) grouping that challenges Western dominance.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nDugin emphasizes the crucial role India can play in the new global order and balance of power, which includes liberation from a colonial mindset and keeping away from West-dominated narratives.\nThe discourse in academic and policy circles, especially in Russia and the Global South, questions Western dominance and the marginalization of non-Western voices and experiences. The debate calls for commitment to diversity, inclusiveness, pluralistic universalism and grounding in world history.\nBesides the NATO expansion to the East, political instability, the rebirth of fascism in Europe and the United States and confronting the new Cold War are the reasons for Russia\u2019s call to build a multipolar world order with the support of Turkey, Egypt, India, China, Brazil, South Africa and others, through Eurasian integration and strengthening multilateral platforms like BRICS, the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation and the Group of 20.\nBRICS is the most crucial institution in the new Cold War and for establishing a multipolar world order. The changing global context and cooperation with Russia in the Global South, especially under the BRICS framework, shows that isolating Russia is difficult.\nRussia is now committed to building a fairer and just multipolar world order as envisioned in the Kazan Declaration, which calls for strengthening multilateralism, enhancing economic cooperation, strengthening people-to-people exchanges, respecting the United Nations Charter and international law, fighting terrorism and climate change, among others.\nA consensus was sought about viewing \u201cunlawful unilateral coercive measures\u201d, such as sanctions, as detrimental to the global economy and Sustainable Development Goals. Therefore, the expanded BRICS agreed to de-dollarize and trade in national currencies.\nPutin sees the current significance of Russia, India and China in the East to confront Containment II, the US' post-Cold War containment policy, in the 21st century, in the same way Lenin observed in 1923 the significance of Russia\u2019s alliance with India and China for ensuring the success of socialism in its struggle against imperialist countries.\nIn the context of the emergence of a multipolar world, former US secretary of state Henry Kissinger said: \u201cIndia will be a fulcrum of 21st-century order: an indispensable element...\u201d\nPutin views that Russia, China and India\u2019s alliance might counter NATO expansion and neoliberal capitalism, strengthen multipolarity and ensure the emergence of a multipolar world order that is more democratic, equitable, prosperous and peaceful.\nIn a recent speech at Valdai International Discussion Club\u2019s plenary meeting in Sochi, Putin said, \u201cIndia should be included in the list of great powers,\u201d considering its fast technological and economic growth.\nThere is speculation that Putin may have played a role in bringing together Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping for a successful meeting at Kazan, where they agreed to keep the overall relationship cooperative, contribute to regional and global peace and act with a long-term view to advancing multipolarity.\nImportantly, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi asserted that Beijing and New Delhi were nonaligned, upheld multilateralism and would contribute to the process of building global multipolarity.\nIndian foreign minister S. Jaishankar, who met Wang on the sidelines of the recent G20 summit in Rio de Janeiro, said the two sides agreed to work together toward rebuilding trust and mutual understanding. Progress would be expected in resuming direct flights, exchanging journalists and facilitating visa issuance.\nAt the 22nd India-Russia summit, Putin and Modi reaffirmed their commitment to the countries\u2019 \u201cspecial and privileged strategic partnership\u201d.\nIndia also adopted a neutral position in the Ukraine-Russia war, urging the latter to resolve the conflict through dialogue and diplomacy in accordance with international law. After the outbreak of war in Ukraine, India-Russia trade expanded considerably.\nIndia is one of the main importers of Russian oil despite pressure from US-Western partners. The target is to increase the trade volume from US$65 billion in 2023 to $100 billion by 2030.\nNext year\u2019s 23rd India-Russia summit will reflect upon and review the partnership, discuss future directions and trajectories and a road map for cooperation toward building global multipolarity. Defense cooperation is the major focus of Russia\u2019s strategic partnership, though trade and economic cooperation is expanding.\nThe writer is an associate professor at Jawaharlal Nehru University\u2019s Centre for Russian and Central Asian Studies.

(JP/Arief Suhardiman)\nD\nonald J. Trump\u2019s reelection as the United States president serves as a reminder that we cannot take the international order for granted. While we respect the choice of the American people, we are all too familiar with the world under his prior administration.\nDuring his first term, the US adopted a more isolationist stance, withdrawing from the Paris Agreement, the United Nations Human Rights Council and the World Health Organization. The US also equally diminished the region\u2019s hopes for stronger trade and diplomatic relations by cancelling the Trans-Pacific Partnership and skipping the ASEAN-related meetings beyond the Manila Summit in 2017. &nbsp;\nWhile it remains uncertain how Trump will steer his second-term administration, the unhealthy geopolitical and geoeconomic ambitions of recent years have damaged global stability and eroded hard-won milestones.\nThe cost has been too high. Victims of humanitarian crises in Gaza, Ukraine, Sudan and elsewhere are left helpless. Measures to combat global challenges such as technological advancement, climate change and health emergencies are hindered by rising protectionist trade measures and industrial policies.\nMeanwhile, many least developed economies are struggling to service unmanageable sovereign debt. These are symptoms of a greater danger and it could threaten Indonesia\u2019s aspiration to become a high-income country by 2045. &nbsp;\nThe world must revive the habit of dialogue and reinforce inclusive principles.

addition of this port, this part of the Pacific and Peru in particular could become the logistical hub of South America,\" Rios told AFP.\nThe facility will be unveiled by Xi and his Peruvian counterpart Dina Boluarte on the sidelines of this week's Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Lima.\nSouth America's 'Silk Road'&nbsp;\nThe port is the latest addition to the vast collection of railways, highways and other infrastructure projects built under China's massive Belt and Road Initiative.\nLaunched in 2013, the program initially focused on better connecting China with Europe, Africa and the rest of Asia but has since expanded to include South America.\nChancay, a fishing town of around 50,000 inhabitants, was chosen for its strategic location in the heart of South America.\nCosco Shipping Ports, which has a 30-year concession to operate the terminal, has forecast it will handle up to one million containers in its first year of operations.\nChancay is expected to be a major hub for imports of Asian electronics, textiles and other consumer goods and for the export of minerals, including lithium -- a metal used in mobile phone and laptop batteries -- from Chile and copper from both Chile and Peru.\n\"Peru is a source of raw materials for China,\" Oscar Vidarte, professor of international relations at the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru, told AFP.\nBilateral trade between the Asian giant and Peru, one of Latin America's fastest-growing economies for the past decade, stood at nearly $36 billion in 2023, making Peru China's fourth-largest Latin American trading partner.\n\"Our goal is to become the Singapore of Latin America,\" Peruvian Transport Minister Raul Perez told reporters at Chancay.\n\"We will have direct routes to Asia, in particular to China, which will reduce (shipping time) by 10, 15, even 20 days, depending on the route,\" compared to 35-40 days currently, he said.\nChancay port will also serve Chile, Colombia and Ecuador, among other South American countries, allowing them to skirt ports in Mexico and the United States for trade with Asia.\n\"It will allow China to position itself in this part of the world,\" Vidarte said.\nFrancisco Belaunde, a professor in international law at Lima University and other faculties, called it \"part of the battle for geopolitical influence\" in South America pitting China against the United States.\nConnected to the Pan-American highway&nbsp;-- a network of roads linking most of North and South America along the Pacific -- through a mile-long tunnel, the port will use artificial intelligence to inspect containers for drugs and other illicit goods, according to Perez, the transport minister.\nPeru is the world's biggest cocaine producer after Colombia.\nCurrently, much of the drug is smuggled through the port of Guayaquil in neighboring Ecuador.\n\"We will use the most advanced technology to ensure the safety of the containers,\" Perez said.\n&nbsp;\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn

He should not, however, forget East Asia, Pacific and ASEAN countries whose heads of state and government dominated the list of foreign guests attending his inauguration as Indonesia\u2019s eighth president on Oct. 20.\nThe honored guests were visibly pleased when Prabowo called out their full names and titles one by one in his first state address. This has rarely happened in such a state ceremony and can be seen as a trademark for Prabowo\u2019s personal touch. According to Prabowo, 19 heads of state, 19 heads of government and 15 special envoys accepted his invitation.\nPrabowo has grown in prominence internationally since his predecessor Joko \u201cJokowi\u201d Widodo appointed him the defense minister in 2019. After winning the February election, Prabowo toured a number of countries in a show of diplomatic acumen.\n\u201cIn facing the international world, we choose a free and active path, we do not want to join any military pacts. We want to be a good neighbor,\u201d President Prabowo said in his inaugural speech, sending a clear message to his foreign guests.\nEast Asia was represented by South Korean Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, Chinese Vice President Han Zheng and former Japanese foreign minister Masahiko K\u014dmura. As president-elect Prabowo had paid a courtesy call to Chinese President Xi Jinping in Bejing and then Japanese prime minister Fumio Kishida in Tokyo in April. However, Prabowo has not visited Seoul for talks with President Yoon Sook-yeol.\nThe three East Asian nations are Indonesia\u2019s most important trading and economic partners and strategic investment sources. The recurring crisis in the Taiwan Strait, the constant nuclear threats from North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, and the increasing military tensions in the South China Sea are three potential sources of instability in the Indo-Pacific region.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nIn his courtesy call to Vice President\nGibran Rakabuming Raka\n, Han reiterated China\u2019s readiness to \u201ccontinue to deepen the practical cooperation in various fields with the high-quality Belt and Road Initiative [BRI] cooperation taking the lead\u201d.\nHan became the first foreign guest Gibran has received since his inauguration. The young Vice President will need more international exposure, which Prabowo will provide by assigning him to international duties except for major global and multilateral events. Due to his lack of experience in diplomacy, Gibran will need foreign affairs advisors.\nPrabowo has chosen Beijing as the first destination of his inaugural overseas visit. In Beijing Prabowo is scheduled to hold talks with President Xi, amid tension in Indonesia\u2019s exclusive economic zone in Natuna waters, where the Maritime Security Agency (Bakamla) has expelled China Coast Guard vessels three times within the past week.\nDuring his two-week overseas trip, Prabowo will also visit London to meet British PM Keir Starmer and King Charles after attending the APEC and Group of 20 summits in Peru and Brazil, respectively. Prabowo also plans to hold talks with the next United States president.\nPrabowo initially also wished to visit Tokyo again, but as Japan is facing political uncertainty after the new PM Shigeru Ishiba\u2019s ruling party LDP failed to maintain its parliamentary majority, Prabowo decided to postpone the visit. But whoever will be in charge of the Japanese government, even the opposition, Indonesia\u2019s relationship with the world\u2019s fourth-largest economy will remain strong and stable.\nBut what about South Korea? Prabowo has at least a moral obligation to return the attendance of PM Han by making at least a brief visit to Seoul. Han has conveyed an official invitation from President Yoon to President Prabowo. The two countries need to fully settle their stalled military cooperation by seeking a win-win solution while sticking to internationally recognized laws in resolving disputes.\nNow, look at the ASEAN member states, six of whose leaders attended Prabowo\u2019s inauguration. They were Singapore\u2019s PM Lawrence Wong, Malaysian PM Anwar Ibrahim, Brunei\u2019s Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah, Cambodian PM Hun Manet and Philippine President Ferdinand \u201cBongbong\u201d Marcos Jr. They came to show their respect to their new colleague, who had visited them before his inauguration.\nPrabowo wants to go global. But he needs to remember that ASEAN plays a very important role in boosting Indonesia\u2019s influence at the international level. Indonesia cannot go all alone without ASEAN, which has now grown into one of the world\u2019s prominent regional blocs.\nMeanwhile, Pacific countries were represented by New Zealand Deputy PM Winston Peters, Papua New Guinea\u2019s (PNG) PM James Marape, Vanuatu\u2019s PM Charlot Salwai, Timor-Leste\u2019s PM Xanana Gusmao and Solomon Islands\u2019 PM Jeremiah Manele. Indonesia tends to suspect the Pacific region as a major supporter of the Papuan separatist movement and therefore Jakarta\u2019s approach is aimed at keeping the region \u201csilent\u201d about Papua.\nSmall Pacific nations share a strong emotional bond with Papua due to their Melanesian roots. President Prabowo should plan a visit to these nations to build Indonesia\u2019s relationship with them anew. Prabowo has visited PNG, but not yet Timor-Leste, where as a soldier he fought Xanana when the territory was colonized by Indonesia decades ago.\nWhat is also interesting was the attendance of Australia\u2019s Deputy PM and Defense Minister Richard Marles. PM Anthony Albanese promised to attend Prabowo\u2019s inauguration when the Indonesian president-elect visited Canberra in August. However, on Oct. 20, King Charles visited Australia, therefore Albanese assigned his deputy Marles to attend Prabowo\u2019s inauguration on his behalf.\nAustralia once also \u201cblacklisted\u201d Prabowo due to his alleged role in atrocities in then East Timor and other human rights violations. The US only lifted its entry ban of Prabowo when he was appointed Jokowi\u2019s defense minister in 2019.\nApart from making visits, President Prabowo is expected to give a priority to East Asia, ASEAN and the Pacific in his diplomacy. Foreign Minister Sugiono and his three deputies, career diplomats Arrmanatha Christiawan Nasir and Arif Havas Oegroseno and politician Anis Matta, can be assigned to pay more attention to the three regions.\nThe foreign dignitaries who came to Jakarta to witness Prabowo\u2019s ascent to power on Oct. 20 surely expect a payback from Prabowo. They regard Indonesia as a strategic partner and want mutually beneficial relations with the republic.\n***\nThe writer is a senior editor at\nThe Jakarta Post.\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Article\nPresident Prabowo's new coal phase-out goal sets 'daunting task'\nICC\u2019s arrest warrant for Myanmar junta chief is a critical step forward\nPhilippine president says Russian submarine in South China Sea 'worrisome'\nMount Fuji photo spot to get new fences to curb jaywalking\nWill Prabowo emulate Duterte\u2019s approach to South China Sea?\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nMore in Opinion\nView more\nAcademia\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo\u2019s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nPolitics\nIndonesia to pardon tens of thousands including Papua activists\nAcademia\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?\nAcademia\nStop with the LGBTQ scapegoating",

Top borrowers were Angola, Ethiopia, Egypt, Nigeria and Kenya.\nBut analysts said an economic slowdown in China has made Beijing increasingly reluctant to shell out big sums.&nbsp;\nChina has also resisted offering debt relief, even as some African nations have struggled to repay their loans -- in some cases being forced to slash spending on vital public services.&nbsp;\nSince the last China-Africa forum six years ago, \"the world experienced a lot of changes, including COVID, geopolitical tension and now these economic challenges\", Tang Xiaoyang of Beijing's Tsinghua University told AFP.\nThe \"old model\" of loans for \"large infrastructure and very rapid industrialization\" is simply no longer feasible, he said.\nThe continent is a key node in Beijing's Belt and Road Initiative, a massive infrastructure project and central pillar of Xi Jinping's bid to expand China's clout overseas.\nThe BRI has channeled much-needed investment to African countries for projects like railways, ports and hydroelectric plants.\nBut critics charge Beijing with saddling nations with debt and funding infrastructure projects that damage the environment.\nOne controversial project in Kenya, a $5 billion railway -- built with finance from Exim Bank of China -- connects the capital Nairobi with the port city of Mombasa.\nBut a second phase meant to continue the line to Uganda never materialized, as both countries struggled to repay BRI debts.\nKenya's President William Ruto last year asked China for a $1 billion loan and the restructuring of existing debt to complete other stalled BRI projects.&nbsp;\nThe country now owes China more than $8 billion.\nRecent deadly protests in Kenya were triggered by the government's need \"to service its debt burden to international creditors, including China\", said Alex Vines, head of the Africa Program at London's Chatham House.\nIn light of such events, Vines and other analysts expect African leaders at this week's forum to seek not only more Chinese investment but also more favorable loans.\nIn central Africa, Western and Chinese firms are racing to secure access to rare minerals.\nThe continent has rich deposits of manganese, cobalt, nickel and lithium -- crucial for renewable energy technology.\nThe Moanda region of Gabon alone contains as much as a quarter of known global reserves of manganese, and South Africa accounts for 37 percent of global output of the metal.\nCobalt mining is dominated by the Democratic Republic of Congo, which accounts for 70 percent of the world total. But in terms of processing, China is the leader, at 50 percent.\nMounting geopolitical tensions between the United States and China, which are clashing over everything from the status of self-ruled Taiwan to trade, also weigh on Africa.\nWashington has warned against what it sees as Beijing's malign influence.\nIn 2022, the White House said China sought to \"advance its own narrow commercial and geopolitical interests [and] undermine transparency and openness\".\nBeijing insists it does not want a new cold war with Washington but rather seeks \"win-win\" cooperation, promoting development while profiting from boosted trade.\n\"We do not just give aid, give them help,\" Tsinghua University's Tang said.\n\"We are just partners with you while you are developing. We are also benefiting from it.\"\nBut analysts fear African nations could be forced to pick sides.&nbsp;\n\"African countries lack leverage against China,\" Development Reimagined's Eguegu said.\n\"Some people [...] think you can use the US to balance China,\" he said. \"You cannot.\"\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Article\nChina\u2019s fast-changing economic adjustments\nGovt eyes 10% investment growth, chipmaking to achieve GDP target\nBiden pushes new Russia, Iran, Korea, China effort before Trump term\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources\nGovt halts big infrastructure in trade-off for food security: Minister\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nMore in Business\nView more\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nTech\nMinister says Apple 'losing out' by dragging its feet on $1b investment\nRegulations\nMinistry inks collab with army, police on food security\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo\u2019s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nPolitics\nIndonesia to pardon tens of thousands including Papua activists\nAcademia\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?\nAcademia\nStop with the LGBTQ scapegoating",

(AFP/Pavel Volkov)\nR\nussian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping were set to participate Thursday in a regional summit in Central Asia bringing together numerous countries opposed to the West.\nPutin and Xi regularly meet under the aegis of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) alliance, whose latest session is being held in Kazakhstan's capital city of Astana.&nbsp;\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is also attending, since his country is a \"dialogue partner\" with the bloc, whose full members including ex-Soviet Central Asian states, India, China, Russia and Iran.\nOn Wednesday, Putin had bilateral meetings with Erdogan and Xi ahead of the main session, telling the Chinese leader that the Shanghai alliance was strengthening its role as \"one of the key pillars of a fair multipolar world order\".\nBoth countries have railed against what they call US-led \"hegemony\" on the world stage.\nXi, criticised in the West for his growing support for Moscow, told Putin Wednesday he was delighted to see his \"old friend\" again.\nErdogan also met Putin on the sidelines Wednesday, inviting him to Turkey and calling for a \"fair peace that can satisfy both sides\" in Ukraine. The Turkish leader has sought to mediate between the warring countries.\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is not attending.\nCompetition with West&nbsp;\nThe SCO was founded in 2001 but has come to prominence in recent years. Its nine full member countries are China, India, Iran, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Pakistan and Tajikistan.\nIt is intended to be a platform for cooperation in competition with the West, with a focus on security and economics.\nA year after Western-sanctioned Iran joined as a full member, Belarus, also ostracised for its backing for Russia's war in Ukraine, will become the 10th full member Thursday.\nBelarusian President Alexander Lukashenko in an interview with Kazakh media praised the alliance for \"demonstrating to the world that there are alternative international platforms, different centres of power\".\nThe alliance claims to represent 40 percent of the global population and about 30 percent of its GDP but it is a disparate group with many internal disagreements including territorial disputes.\nWhile Russia and China are united against Western domination, they are economic competitors in Central Asia, a region rich in oil and gas that is also a crucial transport route between Asia and Europe.\nAlternative routes&nbsp;\nThe summit includes Gulf states among its \"dialogue partners\" and in a sign of its growing importance, United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres is set to address delegates Thursday.\nWith the event's security focus, Afghanistan is a likely topic. It has observer status in the SCO but has been absent since the Taliban took power in 2021.\nNone of the members have formally recognised the Taliban government but China has named an ambassador to Kabul, Kazakhstan has removed the Taliban from its list of banned organisations and Moscow has said it will do the same.\nBut the SCO's main thrust is economic ties between member countries and developing giant projects to link up China and Europe via Central Asia.&nbsp;\nRussia's invasion of Ukraine has increased major powers' interest in the region, where Moscow is seeking to maintain its traditional sway but where China now has strong ties through its flagship Belt and Road infrastructure project, while the West is also vying for influence.\nWestern sanctions against Russia have blocked much-used transport links between China and Europe and prompted the European Union to seek alternative routes including through Central Asia.\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Article\nPreparing for total war\nAssad's fall in Syria exposes limits of China's Middle East diplomacy\nGive the new FM time\nTrump threatens 100 percent tariff on BRICS countries\nChina says top military official Miao Hua suspended, under investigation\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nMore in World\nView more\nEurope\nUS announces new arms aid package for Ukraine worth $500 million\nMiddle East and Africa\nUS says Israel is acting in Syria for its own defence\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia welcomes UNGA resolution on immediate ceasefire in Gaza\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo\u2019s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nEntertainment\n'Astro Bot' wins highest award at Oscars of video games\nPolitics\nIndonesia to pardon tens of thousands including Papua activists\nAcademia\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?",

(Pool/AFP/Asanka Ratnayake)\nC\nhinese Premier Li Qiang mixed a dash of \"panda diplomacy\" with a visit to a historic vineyard on Sunday to celebrate a thaw in once-icy trade ties with Australia.\nThe highest ranking Chinese official to visit Australia in seven years, Li's four-day trip offers the prospect of greater trade after Beijing lifted punitive measures against a string of major Australian exports.\nChina is by far Australia's biggest trading partner, taking in nearly 30 percent of its exports last year including major commodities iron ore and coal.\nTwo-way trade reached A$327 billion (US$216 billion) in 2023.\nSetting the warmer tone, Li took a trip to Adelaide Zoo in bright sunshine and announced China would loan new \"adorable\" giant pandas to replace popular pair Wang Wang and Fu Ni.\nThe Adelaide pandas, which have failed to produce offspring since their arrival in 2009, will return to China by the end of the year.\nProspects\nEvery Monday\nWith exclusive interviews and in-depth coverage of the region's most pressing business issues, \"Prospects\" is the go-to source for staying ahead of the curve in Indonesia's rapidly evolving business landscape.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\n\"I guess they must have missed their home a lot,\" said Li, the second most powerful man in China after President Xi Jinping.\nThe premier said China made the panda offer to honour the wishes of Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong, an Adelaide resident who has worked to stabilise the relationship with Beijing.\nWong said her own children would be \"very happy\" at the news, which she welcomed as a \"symbol of goodwill\".\nLi then joined Wong for a lunch at the 19th century Magill Estate vineyard, home of the original Penfolds winery and now part of the Australian global winemaker Treasury Wine Estates.\nWine was among a string of Australian exports, along with coal, timber, barley, beef, and lobsters, battered by Chinese sanctions in 2020 during a diplomatic rift with the former conservative government.\nThose sanctions cost Australian exporters an estimated A$20 billion a year, including A$1 billion for the wine industry.\nThe tariffs have been gradually lifted since Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's government took power in 2022 and adopted a softer diplomatic approach towards China. Lobster is one of the few exports still facing trade barriers.\nLi and Albanese are set to hold talks behind closed doors in Canberra on Monday, encompassing fractious issues of foreign influence, human rights, alleged \"unsafe\" behaviour by China's military in the region, and their rivalry in the Pacific.\nChina's growing clout in the South Pacific, where it seeks to expand security and economic ties with island states traditionally allied with Australia, remains a notable point of tension.\n\"We're in a state of permanent contest in the Pacific. That's the reality,\" Wong told a television interviewer Sunday.\nBut the Chinese premier, who will also head to a lithium mine in Perth, is focusing his attention on economic opportunities despite areas of friction.\n\"Mutual respect, seeking common ground while shelving differences and mutually beneficial cooperation\" are key to the relationship, Li said on his arrival in Adelaide on Saturday.\nAustralia has endured \"a long period of deep freeze, where it was not possible to have any sort of official conversations with China\", said Melissa Conley Tyler, honorary fellow at the University of Melbourne's Asia Institute.&nbsp;\nLi's visit sends a message that \"Australia is back to being seen as a friendly country rather than the unfriendly, hostile country we were seen as during those years of maximum tension,\" she told AFP.\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Article\nOfficials to form new import task force separate from Trade Ministry\nForeign Minister Sugiono lists priorities in debut meeting with lawmakers\nChina's Xi calls for more free trade\nHow a second Trump presidency will impact Indonesia\u2019s economy\nRubio pick signals a Trump China policy that could go beyond tariffs\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nMore in Business\nView more\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nTech\nMinister says Apple 'losing out' by dragging its feet on $1b investment\nRegulations\nMinistry inks collab with army, police on food security\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo\u2019s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nPolitics\nIndonesia to pardon tens of thousands including Papua activists\nAcademia\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?\nAcademia\nStop with the LGBTQ scapegoating",

Chung Sung-Jun/Pool via REUTERS (Reuters/Chung Sung-Jun)\nI\nn their joint declaration that capped their&nbsp;trilateral summit on May 27, host South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and Chinese Premier Li Qiang paid much attention to the strategic importance of ASEAN, apparently because the three leaders found it impossible to find common ground on North Korea, the Taiwan Strait and other regional security threats.\nOne of the prominent examples of their common view on ASEAN is their agreement to use the ASEAN-led Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), billed as the world\u2019s largest free trade agreement, as the basis for&nbsp;their negotiations to reach a much more sophisticated trade pact among them.\nAccording to media reports, the three East Asian leaders agreed to \"keep discussions for speeding up negotiations for a Trilateral FTA\".\nIn their joint statement, the three leaders affirmed \u201cthe importance of ensuring implementation in a transparent, smooth and effective manner of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) Agreement as the basis of a Trilateral Free Trade Agreement (FTA)\u201d.\n\u201cWe will keep discussions for speeding up negotiations for a Trilateral FTA, aiming at realizing a free, fair, comprehensive, high-quality, and mutually beneficial FTA with its own value,\u201d the joint statement reads.\nIt remains too early to get a clearer picture of how ASEAN nations will benefit from the political rapprochement among their northeastern&nbsp;neighbors, which are among their most important trading and investment partners. China and Japan&nbsp;have been competing for influence in&nbsp;Southeast Asia, while South Korea is smartly playing the alternative role thanks to its advanced technology.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nJapanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has softened his ambition to revive the stalled free trade scheme, the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), which was originally aimed at, among other goals, containing China in what was supposed to be&nbsp;close collaboration with the United States.\nIt seems the turnaround has helped the Japanese leader achieve&nbsp;major progress in the negotiation of the trilateral free trade agreement during the Seoul summit. The talks stalled in 2019 because of China\u2019s objections.\nChina, the world\u2019s second-largest economy, Japan, the fourth, and South Korea, the 14\nth\n, are parties to the RCEP, which was approved in 2020 but came into effect on Jan. 1, 2022. Aside from the 10-member ASEAN, other signatories of the legally binding agreement are Australia and New Zealand.\nKishida said, as quoted by the Japanese Foreign Ministry, that Japan intends to have a candid exchange of views on how a future-oriented trilateral free trade agreement should be organized, including&nbsp;high-level economic discipline&nbsp;among the three countries, which have deep ties in both trade and investment, aiming for an RCEP-plus agreement.\nAs recently as February, Japan and the US had supported&nbsp;the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), which grouped mostly Western countries and sought to contain China. However, under president Donald Trump in 2016, Washington axed the TPP.&nbsp;\nHoping the US would return to the trade bloc someday, Japan and Australia sponsored the CPTPP. But later they realized that the US would never come back. As if to add insult to injury, China applied to join the new trade bloc.\nThe CPTPP was practically dead when Joe Biden took office in January 2021. The US president opted not to revive the TPP because of strong domestic opposition to the trade pact.\nBiden then proposed the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF), which did not need the approval of&nbsp;Congress. ASEAN countries accepted the invitation to join the new group more as a matter of diplomatic courtesy to Biden.\nDuring the Seoul summit, the three East Asian leaders expressed their commitment to a closer relationship with ASEAN, one of the world\u2019s most powerful regional organizations and which continues to attract attention from global powers, including the US and its allies.\nChinese Premier Li Qiang praised what he called a restart in relations with Japan and South Korea as he met President Yoon and PM Kishida for the first three-way talks&nbsp;in four years, agreeing to revive trade and security dialogues hampered by global tensions.\n\"For China, South Korea&nbsp;and Japan, our close ties will not change, the spirit of cooperation achieved through crisis response will not change and our mission to safeguard regional peace and stability will not change,\" Li said as quoted by Reuters.\nLi also emphasized close ties with ASEAN, given the region\u2019s stability and stellar economic performance.\n\u201cChina, Japan and South Korea should leverage their respective development strengths to create a new engine for regional cooperation that actively addresses the needs of ASEAN and other neighboring countries. The three countries should work together to boost the momentum of ASEAN Plus Three cooperation,\u201d Premier Li said, as quoted by Xinhua.\nASEAN+3 refers to a dialogue forum involving&nbsp;ASEAN,&nbsp;China, Japan and South Korea that. was initiated in December 1997 and has since evolved to be&nbsp;the main vehicle to promote East Asian cooperation.\nKishida concurred, acknowledging ASEAN\u2019s pivotal role in maintaining peace in the Indo-Pacific region, where great power&nbsp;rivalry is simmering.\n\u201cASEAN plays a central role in regional stability and prosperity and also welcomes the revitalization of the trilateral process. It is thus more and more important for the three countries to cooperate with ASEAN for mainstreaming ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific [AOIP]&nbsp;in order to bring about stability and prosperity in the region,\u201d&nbsp;Kishida said.\nIt remains to be seen how ASEAN will seize the opportunities up for grabs following the Seoul trilateral summit. ASEAN could&nbsp;be an unlikely beneficiary of&nbsp;the tensions and competition among its&nbsp;three northeastern neighbors.\nFor Indonesia, the new development is&nbsp;low hanging fruit, especially for the incoming government.

(Reuters/pool/Chung Sung-Jun) (Reuters/Chung Sung-Jun)\nVersi Bahasa Indonesia\nAfter stalling for more than four years, South Korea, China and Japan finally held their annual trilateral summit on Monday in Seoul. Although the conference saw no substantial progress in the efforts to address politically sensitive issues, the fact that the leaders of the three countries were willing to convene at all contributed much to a meaningful reduction of tension and distrust among them.\nThe 8th Trilateral Business Summit brought together South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol as the host, Chinese Premier Li Qiang and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida.\nWhile President Xi Jinping's absence might raise questions about Beijing's genuine commitment to the relationship with its two neighbors, it is common practice for either the president or the premier to represent China at multilateral meetings.\nThe situation in Northeast Asia is very dangerous. North Korean leader Kim Jong-un is threatening nuclear war, and China is trying to take over Taiwan under a reunification narrative. These are among the reasons that war could break out in the region. Meanwhile, Beijing, Tokyo and Seoul are at odds with each other.\nThe world watched as the leaders shook hands, discussed issues and made a joint declaration. The three countries are the most important trading and economic partners of ASEAN.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nSoutheast Asian countries closely follow the development of their very wealthy northeastern neighbors: China is the world\u2019s second-largest economy, followed by Japan and South Korea, and their combined GDP accounts for more than 20 percent of the global GDP.\nIndonesia considers the China, Japan and South Korea as its most important investors and trading partners and crucial to its economy. This is why the three countries are always on the mind of any Indonesian president.\nIn their joint declaration, Yoon, Kishida and Li said maintaining peace, stability and prosperity on the Korean Peninsula and in Northeast Asia were in everyone's interest. They also agreed to the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and to make positive efforts for the political settlement of the peninsula\u2019s issue.\nDespite differing views on the two main issues and the reluctance of Yoon and Kishida to distance themselves from their main military ally the United States, as Beijing has often requested, the meeting made progress on a number of fronts.\nIn a surprising turn of events, Pyongyang announced hours before the summit that it would soon put a much more deadly spy satellite into orbit. The announcement was not well received by either Yoon or Kishida and it also caused concern for Li, whose country is the most important trading partner and North Korea\u2019s only ally.\nIt is to be expected that any political or military instability and tension will have both direct and indirect impacts on the 10-member ASEAN. It would be remiss not to mention the fact that the three countries, in particular China and Japan, are engaged in a high-level competition to boost their influence and power among economically weaker nations. ASEAN is also becoming increasingly concerned about Beijing\u2019s assertiveness in the South China Sea.\nThe three leaders said they wanted to work more with the regional bloc through the ASEAN Regional Forum and the East Asia Summit. They also talked about the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) led by ASEAN, the world\u2019s second-largest trading bloc. All three major economies are part of the RCEP.\nDespite their disagreements and different approaches, the summit made progress in economy and trade, climate change, people-to-people exchanges, science and health, and aging populations.\nPresident Yoon deserves a pat on the back for successfully completing the pretty tough mission of bringing the three countries together. This was definitely a big win. And the three leaders made some progress, even if it wasn't earth-shattering.\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Article\nASEAN ministers to discuss Myanmar at Thailand meeting, Indonesia says\nChina sends naval, air forces to shadow US plane over Taiwan Strait\nPrabowo mulls extending tour to Middle East\nXi, Biden attend APEC summit, prepare to meet\nPrabowo lands in Peru for APEC Summit\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nMore in Opinion\nView more\nAcademia\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo\u2019s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nEntertainment\n'Astro Bot' wins highest award at Oscars of video games\nPolitics\nIndonesia to pardon tens of thousands including Papua activists\nAcademia\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?",

He has voiced support for developing closer ties with Beijing.\nWang also met Indonesian foreign minister Retno LP Marsudi earlier on Thursday before visiting Jokowi at the presidential palace and then Prabowo at the defense ministry.\nRetno said Jokowi and Wang expressed their desire for regional peace and stability, and repeated calls for a de-escalation and ceasefire in Gaza between Israel and Hamas.\n\"Mr. President emphasized no one would like to see any escalation,\" she told reporters after the meeting.\n\"China's and Indonesia's position are the same on this issue and Mr. President also conveyed his belief that China would also use its influence to prevent escalation.\"\nBeijing's top diplomat will then chair a session of the China-Indonesia High-level Dialogue Cooperation Mechanism on Friday before traveling to Cambodia and Papua New Guinea.\nChina is one of the biggest sources of foreign direct investment in Indonesia and has poured billions of dollars into projects in the archipelago nation.\nIndonesia's foreign policy is typically neutral and Jakarta walks a delicate diplomatic tightrope in its relations between Beijing and Washington, who are chafing over trade, Ukraine, the Middle East, Taiwan and the South China Sea.\nChinese companies have plowed money into the extraction of Indonesian natural resources in recent years, particularly the nickel sector where Beijing's spending has stoked unrest over pay and working conditions.\nJakarta inaugurated Southeast Asia's first high-speed rail line last year, also a multi billion-dollar project backed by Beijing.\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Article\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nPrabowo would \u2018respect\u2019 PDI-P as opposition\nMinistry inks collab with army, police on food security\nMission to Syria\nBiden pushes new Russia, Iran, Korea, China effort before Trump term\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nMore in World\nView more\nEurope\nUS announces new arms aid package for Ukraine worth $500 million\nMiddle East and Africa\nUS says Israel is acting in Syria for its own defence\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia welcomes UNGA resolution on immediate ceasefire in Gaza\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo\u2019s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nPolitics\nIndonesia to pardon tens of thousands including Papua activists\nAcademia\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?\nAcademia\nStop with the LGBTQ scapegoating",

(AFP/Kay Nietfeld)\nG\nerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz arrived in China on Sunday, kicking off a trip in which he faces a tough balancing act as he aims to shore up economic ties with Berlin's biggest trading partner.\nScholz touched down in the southwestern megacity of Chongqing on Sunday morning, Chinese state broadcaster CCTV said, accompanied by a large delegation of ministers and business executives.\nAs Western allies are cranking up pressure on Beijing, Scholz is expected to underline that Germany remains committed to doing business with the world's second-largest economy and rejects US-led calls for \"decoupling\".\nHis friendly overtures towards China risk sparking ire among Washington and EU partners, which have been pushing back against Beijing's heavy subsidies for industries.&nbsp;\n\"China remains a really important economic partner,\" Scholz told journalists on Friday, adding that he would try to level the playing field for German companies in China.\nOn the geopolitical front, Scholz will also use his visit to persuade Chinese President Xi Jinping to exert his influence to rein in his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin and help bring an end to the war in Ukraine.\n\"Given the close relations between China and Russia, Beijing has the possibility to exert its influence on Russia,\" said a German government source in Berlin.\nThe three-day tour through Chongqing, Shanghai and Beijing is Scholz's second trip to China since he took office.\nHis first in November 2022 took place under intense scrutiny, as it came swiftly after Xi strengthened his grip on power, and marked the first post-pandemic visit by a G7 leader to China.\nStung then by painful supply chain disruptions during the health crisis as well as by China's refusal to distance itself from Russia despite Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, Western allies had been scrambling to reduce their reliance on Beijing.\n'Position of strength'&nbsp;\nScholz's visit comes as many of Germany's Western allies confront China on a range of trade issues.\nA slew of probes into state aid for Chinese solar panels, electric cars and wind turbines are ongoing in Brussels.\nThe United States is meanwhile investigating national security risks posed by Chinese technology in cars.\nWith tensions rumbling over Taiwan, US President Joe Biden this week made defence pledges to Japan and the Philippines, while describing behaviour by Beijing in the South China Sea as \"dangerous and aggressive\".\nTwo days before his visit, Scholz held talks with France's President Emmanuel Macron, whose office said the leaders \"coordinated to defend a rebalancing of European-Chinese trade relations\".\nBut China is a vital market for Germany, where many jobs depend directly on demand from the Asian giant.\nBoth economies also badly need a boost.\nThe German economy shrank by 0.3 percent last year, battered by inflation, high interest rates and cooling exports, and for this year, the economy ministry expects just an anaemic growth of 0.2 percent.&nbsp;\nBeijing has set an annual GDP growth target of around five percent for this year, but exports plunged more than expected last month.&nbsp;\nGerman MPs and analysts urged Scholz to take a firm line.\nThe Green party's Deborah Duering warned Scholz against viewing China just as an economic opportunity.\n\"Those who ignore long-term risks for short-term profits risk repeating the mistakes of the past, misguided Russia policy,\" said Duering, in reference to past dependency on Moscow for cheap energy supplies.\nMax Zenglein of the Mercator Institute for China Studies said Germany should not hesitate to be more assertive.\n\"As countries such as the USA and Japan are positioning themselves much more sharply against China, Germany has an important role to play,\" he said, adding that Germany was \"in a position of strength\".\n&nbsp;\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Article\nNavigating Indonesia-US relations amid global and domestic changes\nLuigi Mangione was charged with murder -

(Reuters/Florence Lo)\nA\nnational election in the Solomon Islands, the first since Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare signed a security pact with Beijing, will be watched next week for its potential to jolt the United States-China rivalry in the South Pacific.\nThe US and Australia are concerned about China's naval ambitions in Pacific countries, as tensions rise over Taiwan.\nDespite its population of just 700,000, the Solomon Islands occupies a strategic position 1,600 kilometers northeast of Australia, strewn with World War Two wrecks that remind it was once a pivotal battlefield.\nVoters will be focused on hospitals struggling without medicines, education shortcomings and inadequate roads when they cast ballots on Wednesday, April 17, opposition party lawmakers said.\nBut Sogavare's rapid embrace of China since he won power four years ago \u2014 including inviting Chinese police into the archipelago and switching diplomatic ties from Taiwan \u2014 is also in the spotlight.\n\"The services and economy are really in a desperate situation. The issue of China and this new relationship is also important. That is a source of anger towards Sogavare,\" said Democratic Alliance Party leader Rick Houenipwela, who was prime minister before Sogavare.\nSogavare, installed as prime minister by independent candidates who won a combined 37% of the vote in 2019, has pointed to hosting the Pacific Games as a major achievement and pledged to strengthen relations with China.\nChina donated stadiums for the Games, and is building ports, roads and a Huawei telecommunications network.\nOpposition parties said they would scrap the China security pact or hold a national referendum on it, and reduce China's influence by accepting more infrastructure support from US allies.\n&nbsp;\n'Not convinced'\nPeter Kenilorea, whose United Party won 10 percent of votes in 2019, said he wants Solomon Islands to return to being a reliable partner of Australia and New Zealand, and would abolish the China security pact.\n\"We're not convinced it's in the interests of Solomon Islands,\" he said.\nClosely watched will be election results in Malaita, the most populous province, which has long criticized deepening China ties and is where opposition parties hope to gain nine seats.\nMalaita's governor Daniel Suidani refused to allow Chinese companies to operate in the province until he was ousted in a no-confidence vote in 2023.\nHis replacement, Martin Fini, has signed Chinese cooperation deals, including last week, when China's special envoy for the Pacific Qian Bo visited Malaita.\nThe prime minister is selected by winning lawmakers, often weeks after the election results.\nHouenipwela's party has formed a coalition with Matthew Wale's Solomon Islands Democratic Party, which won the biggest vote (14 percent) in 2019, and is seeking a combined majority of 26 seats.\nAustralian National University Pacific expert Graeme Smith said the shift away independents was a significant development this election, with Sogavare also convincing many government members to join his new party.\nAustralia has sent 400 police and military to assist Royal Solomon Islands Police Force (RSIPF) with election security, alongside New Zealand and Pacific forces. Chinese police will remain in a training role, the RSIPF said.\nElection observer groups from Australia, New Zealand, the Pacific, Japan, Europe and the US will monitor voting and counting, with national and provincial polls held on the same day.\nSogavare, who didn't respond to a request for comment, has said publicly he would not host a Chinese military base \u2014 which Washington and Canberra have said is a red line.\nChina says its security cooperation Solomon Islands is a sovereign matter for the two countries and has denied it wants a military base, but US military leaders remain unconvinced.\n\"The increased policing presence in the Solomon Islands is concerning, that's a foot in the door, and then we'll see where it goes from there,\" commander of the US Indo Pacific Command, Adm. John Aquilino, said in an interview.\n\"But the goal is to have the ability to deliver infrastructure and ultimately a place for Chinese military power.\"\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Article\nAustralia to charge tech companies for news content if they do not pay\nBiden pushes new Russia, Iran, Korea, China effort before Trump term\nDharma\u2019s surprising uptick in support reflects growing protest votes\nRidwan gears up for runoff despite rival claiming single-round victory\nIndonesian government aims to return foreign prisoners by January\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nMore in World\nView more\nEurope\nUS announces new arms aid package for Ukraine worth $500 million\nMiddle East and Africa\nUS says Israel is acting in Syria for its own defence\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia welcomes UNGA resolution on immediate ceasefire in Gaza\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo\u2019s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nPolitics\nIndonesia to pardon tens of thousands including Papua activists\nAcademia\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?\nAcademia\nStop with the LGBTQ scapegoating",

(JP/Deni Ghifari)\nI\nn November, President\nPrabowo Subianto\nvisited China, the United States, Peru, Brazil, the United Kingdom and United Arab Emirates (UAE)&nbsp;to strengthen bilateral and multilateral ties, highlighting Indonesia's growing influence in Asia and the Americas.\nAs 2025 approaches, the global landscape remains multipolar, with rising US-China&nbsp;tensions. Following the Non-Aligned Movement, Indonesia pursues an independent foreign policy prioritizing its national interests. Its strategic position along key maritime trade routes enhances its role in regional stability and global commerce.\nWhile China aims to reduce competitors' influence, Indonesia leverages its relationship with China to negotiate with the US and other advanced economies. However, Indonesia must carefully engage with China to protect its security and sovereignty. President Prabowo has reiterated his commitment to cooperation with China, but this evolving dynamic has overshadowed US diplomatic efforts. For a more effective approach, the US should reassess its policies toward Indonesia and focus on building strong economic partnerships.\nIn recent years, Indonesia has fundamentally redefined its maritime strategy,&nbsp;particularly under former president Joko \u201cJokowi\u201d Widodo\u2019s administration, enhancing its role in the Indo-Pacific with a strategic naval policy. This evolution positions Indonesia as a vital player in regional security and governance.\nAs the US and Indonesia celebrate 75 years of diplomatic ties, their relationship has evolved into a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership (CSP), reinforcing cooperation in addressing global challenges. This partnership is crucial for stability and prosperity, aligning with Indonesia's strategic goals through initiatives like the Indo-Pacific&nbsp;Economic Framework (IPEF).

(AFP/Alexander Nemenov)\nP\nresident Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday that Russia would develop artificial intelligence with BRICS partners and other countries,&nbsp;in&nbsp;a bid to challenge the dominance of the United States in one of the most promising and crucial technologies of the 21st century.\nSpeaking at Russia's flagship AI conference, Putin said the new AI Alliance Network would include national associations and development institutions in the field of AI from BRICS countries and other interested states.&nbsp;\n\"Russia must participate on equal terms in the global race to create strong artificial intelligence. It is precisely the advanced solutions that Russian scientists are currently working on,\" Putin told an AI conference in Moscow.&nbsp;\n\"We invite scientists from all over the world to join in the collaboration,\" he added.\nWestern sanctions intended to restrict Russia's access to the technologies it needs to sustain its war against Ukraine have resulted in the world's major producers of microchips halting exports to Russia, sorely limiting its AI ambitions.\nRussia's dominant lender Sberbank is spearheading AI development in Russia, but&nbsp;Sberbank CEO German Gref acknowledged in 2023 that graphics processing units (GPUs), the microchips that underpin AI development, were the trickiest hardware for Russia to replace.&nbsp;\nOn Wednesday, the bank said national AI associations from BRICS members Brazil, China, India and South Africa, but also from Serbia,&nbsp;Indonesia&nbsp;and other non-BRICS countries, had joined the AI Alliance Network.\nIt said the network would facilitate joint research into technology and AI regulation, and&nbsp;provide opportunities for AI products&nbsp;to be sold in&nbsp;member countries' markets.\nThe United States and China are the world's top AI powers, and US President-elect Donald Trump has named a \"White House AI and Crypto Czar\" to help ensure the United States remains the richest and most technologically advanced power in the world.\nBut Putin's move to ally with China could change the dynamics of the AI race.\nRussia is one of 10 countries, including the US, China, Britain and Israel, that are developing their own generative AI models. The Yakov and Partners consultancy, run by former McKinsey employees in Moscow, says this gives it the potential to become a much more significant player.\nRussia sees the use of AI technologies across all sectors adding 11.2 trillion roubles ($109 billion) to gross domestic product in 2030, compared to 0.2 trillion roubles ($1.9 billion) in 2023.&nbsp;\nIts AI strategy also says that 80 percent of all Russian workers should have AI skills by 2030, compared with 5 percent in 2023, while AI investment should grow seven-fold to 850 billion roubles.&nbsp;\nSberbank, which has developed a generative AI model called GigaChat, and technology leader Yandex, with its YandexGPT model, dominate Russia's domestic AI market.&nbsp;\nRussia currently ranks 31st of 83 countries by AI implementation, innovation and investment on UK-based Tortoise Media's Global AI Index, well behind not only the United States and China but also fellow BRICS members India and Brazil.&nbsp;\nStanford University's AI vibrancy tool, which evaluates 36 countries based on 42 AI indicators including research and development, ranks Russia 29th.\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Article\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nChina\u2019s fast-changing economic adjustments\nChinese guards on the ground in Myanmar could go disastrously wrong\nTrump's unorthodox cabinet picks test party loyalty\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nMore in World\nView more\nEurope\nUS announces new arms aid package for Ukraine worth $500 million\nMiddle East and Africa\nUS says Israel is acting in Syria for its own defence\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia welcomes UNGA resolution on immediate ceasefire in Gaza\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo\u2019s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nEntertainment\n'Astro Bot' wins highest award at Oscars of video games\nPolitics\nIndonesia to pardon tens of thousands including Papua activists\nAcademia\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?",

(Reuters/Dilara Senkaya)\nJ\nust over a year ago, China gave Bashar al-Assad and his wife a warm welcome during their six-day visit to the country, offering the former Syrian leader a rare break from years of international isolation since the start of a civil war in 2011.\nAs the couple attended the Asian Games, President Xi Jinping vowed to support Assad in \"opposing external interference\" and in Syria's rebuilding, while his wife Asma was feted in Chinese media.\nBut the abrupt end to the rule of the authoritarian leader so explicitly backed by Xi only last year has dealt a blow to China's diplomatic ambitions in the Middle East and exposed the limits of its strategy in the region, analysts say.\nA coalition of rebels seized Syria's capital Damascus on Sunday after a lightning offensive that toppled&nbsp;Assad's regime and ended his family's 50-year dynasty.\n\"There's been a lot of an exaggerated sense of China's ability to shape political outcomes in the region,\" said Jonathan Fulton, a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council.\nWhile the collapse of the Assad regime was seen reducing the influence in the Arab world of his main backers, Iran and Russia, it was also a blow for China's global ambitions, said Fulton.\n\"A lot of what (China has) been doing internationally has relied on support with those countries, and their inability to prop up their biggest partner in the Middle East says quite a lot about their ability to do much beyond the region.\"\nTackling Hotspots&nbsp;\nAfter China brokered a deal between long-time rivals Saudi Arabia and Iran in 2023, Chinese media praised Beijing's rising profile in a neighbourhood long dominated by Washington.&nbsp;\nWang Yi, China's top diplomat, said the country would play a constructive role in handling global \"hotspot issues\".\nChina also brokered a truce between Fatah, Hamas and other rival Palestinian factions earlier this year and has made repeated calls for a ceasefire in Gaza.\nBut despite bringing Middle Eastern leaders to Beijing and rounds of \"shuttle diplomacy\" by its Middle Eastern envoy, Zhai Jun, in the months since, Palestinians have not formed a unity government and the conflict in Gaza continues.\n\"Assad's sudden downfall is not a scenario Beijing wishes to see,\" said Fan Hongda, a Middle East scholar at Shanghai International Studies University. \"China prefers a more stable and independent Middle East, as chaos or a pro-American orientation in the region does not align with China's interests.\"&nbsp;\nThe response by China's foreign ministry to Assad's fall has been muted, focusing on the safety of Chinese nationals and calling for a \"political solution\" to restore stability in Syria as soon as possible.\nMinistry of foreign affairs spokesperson, Mao Ning, on Monday appeared to leave an opening for engagement with the future government: \"China's friendly relations with Syria are for all Syrian people,\" she said.\nChinese experts and diplomats say Beijing will now bide its time before recognising a new government in Damascus.&nbsp;\nIt could use its expertise and financial muscle to support reconstruction, they say, but its commitments are likely to be limited because China has sought to minimise financial risks overseas in recent years.\nSyria joined China's flagship Belt and Road Initiative in 2022, but there have been no significant investments by Chinese firms since, partly due to sanctions.&nbsp;\nChina is \"not really able to fundamentally replace the West either as an economic partner, or diplomatic or military force in the region,\" said Bill Figueroa, assistant professor at the University of Groningen and an expert in China-Middle East relations.\n\"China in 2024 has way less money than China in 2013 - 2014, when the BRI was launched,\" Figueroa said. There is \"an obvious reassessment going on in the direction of safer investments and reducing China's risks overall,\" he added.\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Article\nUN General Assembly calls for 'unconditional' Gaza ceasefire\nPentagon chief urges 'close consultation' between Israel and US on Syria\nIndonesia must regain credibility as an honest broker\nTrump\u2019s second term could deepen Indonesia-China relations\nIndonesia urges citizens to exercise caution during transition of power in Syria\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nMore in World\nView more\nEurope\nUS announces new arms aid package for Ukraine worth $500 million\nMiddle East and Africa\nUS says Israel is acting in Syria for its own defence\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia welcomes UNGA resolution on immediate ceasefire in Gaza\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo\u2019s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nEntertainment\n'Astro Bot' wins highest award at Oscars of video games\nPolitics\nIndonesia to pardon tens of thousands including Papua activists\nAcademia\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?",

(AFP/Tang Chhin Sothy)\nB\narely 10 days before the ASEAN and Related Summits in Vientiane, on Oct. 9-11, China agreed to unleash a stimulus package of US$1.3 trillion.\nAlmost instantly, the Hong Kong Stock Exchange began to experience the fastest bull run the stock market has ever seen, compelling traders in Hong Kong, Shenzhen and Shanghai to cancel their week-long vacation that was starting on Oct. 1.\nThe leaders of Australia, Canada, the European Union, the United States and the United Kingdom, all of whom had flown into ASEAN to meet with various leaders, especially Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim who will lead ASEAN all through 2025, could not have been unimpressed with China's impeccable timing.\nTo be sure, the Nomura Research Center in Japan warned that a huge stimulus that is too big and too fast can potentially trigger a bubble. The fact is China prompted all the countries that were concerned with the developments in the South China Sea to take a more nuanced approach toward Beijing too.\nWhile the Philippines was adamant that China's maritime behavior must change, Vietnam was surreptitiously quiet. In turn, China did not trouble the waters openly in ASEAN.\nThis despite Vietnam's attempt to enlarge several features in the Paracel Islands based on reclaimed land that China had originally pioneered. If anything, China and ASEAN all concurred with Anwar's assertion that all sensitive issues should be discussed bilaterally, if need be, multilaterally, but more than anything else, behind closed doors.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nPerhaps issues such as the Rohingya and southern Thailand need to be addressed in the same manner to make them practical for resolution.\nWhile Anwar promised that Malaysia's chairmanship of ASEAN would focus on resilience and sustainability, a theme that has been around since 2019 when Thailand was then the chair, Anwar could not have ignored the importance of 2026 too.\nThe latter will be the year when the Philippines is the chair of ASEAN; followed by Singapore in 2027. For Anwar 2026 and 2027 are important as he has the option to call the 16th general election in Malaysia to get a second tenure of another five years in office, having become the 10th prime minister of Malaysia on Nov. 24, 2022.\nIndeed, Anwar told MNBC two weeks prior to the summit that in order to be a \"statesman, one cannot ignore the importance of being a politician.\"\nAnwar was being candid. Politicians, especially a Muslim democrat, must know how to win elections; notwithstanding the fact that Anwar has a two-thirds electoral majority based on the support that has been pledged to the coalition government.\nWhat makes Anwar confident that he can ensure a strong and resilient ASEAN that extends not merely from the security of the member states' supply chain but can handle the tensions that emanate from the Taiwan Strait, the East China Sea and finally the South China Sea?\nA good way to understand the statecraft of Anwar is his deep belief in alliance building, sometimes even reaching out to countries that are deemed to be opposed by the Group of Seven and EU such as China, Russia and Iran; of which the last three can be plainly described as a triple axis.\nThis is where Anwar's strategic and economic statecraft is based on alliance building and a loose amalgamation with the axis of China, Russia and Iran has to be broken down into six levels of analysis.\nFirst and foremost, Malaysia under Anwar practices a dynamic yet quiescent diplomacy. Reliable sources have confirmed that Anwar did not try to build strong bridges with the US during the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Summit in November 2023 in San Francisco.\nIn California, Anwar was even willing to drop all mention of the war in Israel, hoping that this could reduce the tensions between Hamas, the Houthis and Hezbollah and Israel. If one were to examine the speech of Anwar at APEC, he did condemn violence from all sides in the Middle East.\nThis was not merely an overture to Washington, to which Anwar admits \"cumulatively the US remains the largest trading partner of Malaysia\u201d, and by extension ASEAN. The US has been in Southeast Asia for a long time since its first annexation of the Philippines in 1898.\nBut it is not necessarily Malaysia that wants the foreign direct investment (FDI) of the US. The whole of ASEAN wants it to complement its FDI from China, the EU and UK too.\nTo the degree, more relationships need to be built with the triple axis of China, Russia and Iran, of which Iran is increasingly a pivotal power that can decide the geopolitical stability of the world, Anwar has agreed to guide ASEAN beyond its old allies to reach out to BRICS too.\nSecondly, Anwar has also emphasized the importance of the ASEAN-Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) Plus China initiative. In October last year ASEAN already had one inaugural summit in Riyadh.\nGranted the existence of Malaysia's Look East Policy that includes China, Japan and South Korea. The latter became the comprehensive strategic partner of ASEAN in Laos, leaving Japan as the lone polity out for now.\nVery soon Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, if he leads the Liberal Democratic Party to another electoral victory in November, will want to join the ASEAN-GCC Summit.\nThird, Anwar did not leave out the importance of the EU. If anything, Anwar emphasized the criticality of ASEAN and the EU enhancing their mutual trade.\nThis would be music to the ear of Prime Minister Lawrence Wong of Singapore, whom Anwar will meet again in early December to consolidate the Johor-Singapore Economic and Financial Zone. Why would Singapore be pleased with Anwar? For the longest time since the mid-1990s, Singapore has always supported, even convened the first, Europe and ASEAN Meeting (ASEM).\nFourth, Anwar has called for the admission of Timor-Leste into ASEAN by 2025. As and when, Timor-Leste succeeds, after more than two decades of waiting as a mere observer, ASEAN will extend its reach into the South Pacific Forum (SPF), which gathers 16 Micronesian states.\nThe Indo-Pacific rivalry that is so important to the Quad (Australia, US, India and Japan) cannot expand its influence into the South Pacific without first consulting ASEAN, since Timor-Leste would be a key member of Southeast Asia.\nThe \"convening power\" of ASEAN, all of which adds up to the centrality of Southeast Asia to the great powers, will be enhanced by Anwar with the tacit and open endorsement of all countries.\nIn sum, all geopolitical strategies could come to naught if Malaysia, for that matter ASEAN, does not know how to tackle economic issues jointly.\nBut beyond the quadruple alliance cum axis strategy to allow ASEAN to engage with the Global South and Global North, Anwar has explained the necessity of enhancing the intra-regional trade of ASEAN. This is to go beyond the 25 percent threshold currently in place to attain a regional self-sufficiency to be the fourth-largest economy in the world by 2030.\nThis could potentially still see Anwar and Wong and soon-to-be-inaugurated president-elect\nPrabowo Subianto\nof Indonesia all remaining in office.\nWith Malaysia focused on digitalization, renewable energy and manufacturing as some of the key planks of its growth strategy, all of which are shared by other members of ASEAN, Anwar is not short of the strategic depth to be the major statesman of Southeast Asia in the first half of the 21st century.\n***\nThe writer is CEO of Strategic Pan-Indo Pacific Arena\n.\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Article\nFrench troubles won't undermine Europe\u2019s strong foundation\nTrump\u2019s second term could deepen Indonesia-China relations\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources\nConsumers upbeat on RI economy in November, but spending boost unlikely\nPutin\u2019s India visit aims to shape global multipolarity\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nMore in Opinion\nView more\nAcademia\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo\u2019s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nEntertainment\n'Astro Bot' wins highest award at Oscars of video games\nPolitics\nIndonesia to pardon tens of thousands including Papua activists\nAcademia\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?",

(Antara/Fikri Yusuf)\nA\nfter concluding the Indonesia-Africa Forum 2024 with billions in cooperation pledges, Indonesia needs to figure out if it is serious about pivoting its foreign policy, what the benefits of this move would be and to what extent Indonesia is in a better position to make the pivot compared to other contenders.\nThese details are not only important to African countries, but also to Indonesia\u2019s neighbors, other regions of the world and even the great powers \u2014 the United States and China. As such, I argue that Indonesia must stop treating forums as its key diplomatic performance indicators and instead craft a tailored grand strategy for the region.\nA focus on convening meetings has always been in Indonesia\u2019s diplomatic records. From the 1955 Asian African Conference to the 2024 Indonesia-Africa Forum, the country ostensibly believes that meetings can achieve two goals in one strike: generating concrete economic benefits and exercising leadership on the global stage.\nThrough a forum, Indonesia\u2019s meetings, incentives, conferences and exhibitions (MICE) sector can generate revenue from the visiting delegates and some of them may buy handmade souvenirs from the country\u2019s small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Through a forum, Indonesian leaders can shake hands with their counterparts from diverse African countries, taking photos that are then used as a measurement of progress.\nWhile this pragmatic paradigm is not unique to Indonesia, the country can absolutely do better considering its position as a growing economic powerhouse.\nFor starters, the seriousness of Indonesia\u2019s Africa pivot cannot be justified only by organizing a forum.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nAdequate resources and public awareness are crucial. Unfortunately, African countries are yet to enjoy these privileges from Indonesia.

(AFP/Adek Berry)\nT\nhe Third Plenary Session of the 20th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC), held in Beijing from July 15 to 18, marked a significant moment in China\u2019s political and economic landscape.\nThe communiqu\u00e9 issued at the conclusion of this session reaffirms the CPC's commitment to the ideological framework of President Xi Jinping and underscores a comprehensive strategy for China's modernization through deepened reforms. This strategy includes ambitious goals for economic development, governance and national security, reflecting China's commitment to becoming a leading global power.\nCentral to the session's outcomes is the reaffirmation of \u201cXi Jinping Thoughts on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era\u201d. This ideological cornerstone is presented as the guiding light for China's path forward, emphasizing Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, Deng Xiaoping Theory, the Theory of Three Represents and the Scientific Outlook on Development.\nThe synthesis of these doctrines into a cohesive framework illustrates an attempt to root modern policies in historical continuity, providing stability amid significant policy shifts. This ideological commitment aims to consolidate power within the CPC and reinforce Xi\u2019s position at the helm, ensuring alignment with the party\u2019s long-term vision.\nThe communiqu\u00e9 outlines a robust agenda for deepening reforms further to advance Chinese modernization. Key areas include building a high-standard socialist market economy, promoting high-quality economic development, advancing whole-process people's democracy and modernizing China\u2019s governance and national security systems. These goals are ambitious and aim to position China as a leading global power by mid-century.\nThe emphasis on \"promoting high-quality development\" and \"deepening supply-side structural reform\" acknowledges the need for economic recalibration. Shifting toward a more consumption-driven, innovation-based economy is necessary but challenging, requiring profound changes in industrial policy, financial regulation and labor markets.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nThe terms \"whole-process people's democracy\" and \"socialist rule of law\" reflect China's efforts to enhance governance efficiency and legitimacy, contributing to the country's overall stability and progress.\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Article\nTrump\u2019s second term could deepen Indonesia-China relations\nBali airport initiator signs HoA with Chinese company\nA new journey in China-Indonesia relationship: Building a shared future\nIDX Composite closes higher at 7,504.13 on Monday\nA Faustian bargain?

(AFP/Kenzaburo Fukuhara)\nB\ny hosting Xi Jinping on the last leg of the Chinese leader's European tour, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban will get a chance to tighten bonds between Beijing and its closest ally in the EU.\nXi began his trip earlier this week in France, a visit that was cordial but also highlighted tensions between Beijing and the EU over the war in Ukraine and global trade.\nAfter visiting Serbia, a non-EU partner, Xi will arrive in Budapest on Wednesday evening to cap his first European trip since 2019.\nXi can expect a warm welcome when he holds talks with Orban, who has bucked the European Union's official position to \"derisk\" relations with China.\n\"It is clearly a visit of historic significance,\" said Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto, noting that it was the first visit by a Chinese president in 20 years.\nOrban has been championing an \"Eastern opening\" foreign policy since his return to power in 2010, seeking closer economic ties to China, Russia and other Asian countries.\nThe nationalist premier remained committed to his strategy even as tensions between Western nations and Beijing increased over human rights violations, the Covid pandemic, trade and Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\nIn recent years, the Central European country of 9.6 million people has attracted a flood of major Chinese projects, mostly related to battery and electric vehicle (EV) manufacturing.\nHungary has become \"more valuable for Beijing both economically and politically\", said Tamas Matura, an associate professor at Corvinus University.\nIt is the EU's \"last explicitly and openly pro-China government\", Matura added.\nLooking to the East&nbsp;\nLast October, Orban was the sole EU leader to attend a summit for Xi's flagship Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) in Beijing.\nDuring the conference, Orban said Hungary was one of the \"proponents of connectivity, (who) reject the policy which promotes blocs\" amid \"talk of decoupling and derisking\".&nbsp;\n\"The relationship with Hungary is stable and reliable,\" Yan Xuetong, director of the Institute of International Studies at Tsinghua University, told AFP during a visit to Budapest.\n\"Chinese companies feel safe investing in the country, expecting their business won't be disturbed by unpleasant political developments,\" he added.\nSince Hungary began to promote itself as a global hub for EV manufacturing in 2022, several new Chinese businesses have sprung up all over the country.\nBattery manufacturer CATL is building its second European factory near the eastern city of Debrecen, while Chinese carmaker BYD is due to manufacture passenger cars in southern Szeged as early as next year.\nAccording to the Hungarian government, around 15 billion euros' worth of ongoing projects originate from the Asian country.\nIn return, Chinese companies benefit from tax breaks, a favourable regulatory environment and generous infrastructure subsidies.\nRaising concerns&nbsp;\nIn 2015, Hungary became the first European country to join the BRI, a controversial project to revive the Silk Road through global transport networks and infrastructure funded via Chinese loans.\nA high-speed railway project to connect Budapest and Belgrade is behind schedule.\nBilateral cooperation has flourished in other areas, with Budapest purchasing Chinese vaccines during the pandemic and promising to host the first Chinese university campus in the EU.\nIt recently also signed a security pact authorising Chinese police officers to patrol in Hungary alongside local authorities.\nWhile the government says Hungary is benefiting from its partnership with China, opposition parties have raised concerns over a lack of transparency, the environmental impact of battery factories and corruption.\n\"We are giving huge discounts for these projects, which place a huge financial burden on taxpayers... but only Orban's inner circle is getting richer,\" said Sandor Ronai of the left-wing Democratic Coalition.\nMoreover, China has repeatedly relied on Budapest \"to block or significantly water down some EU decisions, which were concerning to them\", said expert Matej Simalcik.\n\"The same logic could also apply to decision-making within NATO,\" he told AFP.\nA NATO member since 1999, Hungary has set itself apart from other allies by calling for an immediate ceasefire in the Ukraine war and denouncing what it called \"war fever\".\nSzijjarto, Hungary's foreign minister, said both countries are in \"absolute agreement\" over their approach to bring \"peace\" to the conflict.\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians

(AFP/STR)\nB\neijing's commerce minister dismissed as \"groundless\" US concerns that a surge of low-cost Chinese exports posed a risk to global markets, as Washington's Treasury chief on Monday wrapped up a visit aimed in part at addressing the issue.\nDuring the visit by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, Chinese officials have sounded a positive note that ties between the two countries are on more stable footing, with both sides agreeing to open channels for further talks on the issue of excess industrial capacity -- though differences clearly remain.\nThe US concern is that with Chinese government support creating more production capacity than global markets can absorb, a flood of cheap exports in key sectors like solar and electric vehicles could impact the growth of those industries elsewhere.\nBut commerce minister Wang Wentao said during a trip to Paris on Sunday that \"the accusations of 'overcapacity' by the United States and Europe are groundless\", state-run Xinhua news agency reported.&nbsp;\nWang said Chinese electric vehicle makers' rapid growth was due to innovation and established supply chains, not subsidies. &nbsp;\nHe added that Beijing would support businesses in defending their interests, Xinhua said.\nProspects\nEvery Monday\nWith exclusive interviews and in-depth coverage of the region's most pressing business issues, \"Prospects\" is

for industry. &nbsp;\nThe European Union has started a probe into Chinese electric car subsidies that could lead to tariffs on vehicles it believes are unfairly sold at a lower price, which Beijing last month condemned as \"protectionism\".\nYellen has brought up overcapacity repeatedly in talks with officials and business leaders in the southern city of Guangzhou and the capital Beijing.\nIn addition to tackling the issue with her counterpart Vice Premier He Lifeng over some 11 hours of engagement, she also raised it with Premier Li Qiang in a bid to bring the concerns to the highest levels of Chinese policymaking.\nAccording to Xinhua, Li told Yellen that Washington should view the matter of production capacity \"objectively\" and from a \"market-oriented\" perspective.\nHe added that the growth of China's new energy industry \"will make important contributions to the global green and low-carbon transition\", the readout of their bilateral meeting said.\nYellen, for her part, has acknowledged that \"this is a complicated issue that involves their entire macroeconomic and industrial strategy\".\n\"It's not going to be solved in an afternoon or a month,\" she earlier told reporters in Guangzhou.\nBut she said Chinese officials had \"heard that this is an important issue to us\" and one that will be critical to the bilateral relationship, as well as China's ties with other countries, going forward.\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS':

(AFP/STR)\nB\neijing's commerce minister dismissed as \"groundless\" US concerns that a surge of low-cost Chinese exports posed a risk to global markets, as Washington's Treasury chief on Monday wrapped up a visit aimed in part at addressing the issue.\nDuring the visit by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, Chinese officials have sounded a positive note that ties between the two countries are on more stable footing, with both sides agreeing to open channels for further talks on the issue of excess industrial capacity -- though differences clearly remain.\nThe US concern is that with Chinese government support creating more production capacity than global markets can absorb, a flood of cheap exports in key sectors like solar and electric vehicles could impact the growth of those industries elsewhere.\nBut commerce minister Wang Wentao said during a trip to Paris on Sunday that \"the accusations of 'overcapacity' by the United States and Europe are groundless\", state-run Xinhua news agency reported.&nbsp;\nWang said Chinese electric vehicle makers' rapid growth was due to innovation and established supply chains, not subsidies. &nbsp;\nHe added that Beijing would support businesses in defending their interests, Xinhua said.\nProspects\nEvery Monday\nWith exclusive interviews and in-depth coverage of the region's most pressing business issues, \"Prospects\" is

for industry. &nbsp;\nThe European Union has started a probe into Chinese electric car subsidies that could lead to tariffs on vehicles it believes are unfairly sold at a lower price, which Beijing last month condemned as \"protectionism\".\nYellen has brought up overcapacity repeatedly in talks with officials and business leaders in the southern city of Guangzhou and the capital Beijing.\nIn addition to tackling the issue with her counterpart Vice Premier He Lifeng over some 11 hours of engagement, she also raised it with Premier Li Qiang in a bid to bring the concerns to the highest levels of Chinese policymaking.\nAccording to Xinhua, Li told Yellen that Washington should view the matter of production capacity \"objectively\" and from a \"market-oriented\" perspective.\nHe added that the growth of China's new energy industry \"will make important contributions to the global green and low-carbon transition\", the readout of their bilateral meeting said.\nYellen, for her part, has acknowledged that \"this is a complicated issue that involves their entire macroeconomic and industrial strategy\".\n\"It's not going to be solved in an afternoon or a month,\" she earlier told reporters in Guangzhou.\nBut she said Chinese officials had \"heard that this is an important issue to us\" and one that will be critical to the bilateral relationship, as well as China's ties with other countries, going forward.\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS':

(JP/Deni Ghifari)\nI\nn November, President\nPrabowo Subianto\nvisited China, the United States, Peru, Brazil, the United Kingdom and United Arab Emirates (UAE)&nbsp;to strengthen bilateral and multilateral ties, highlighting Indonesia's growing influence in Asia and the Americas.\nAs 2025 approaches, the global landscape remains multipolar, with rising US-China&nbsp;tensions. Following the Non-Aligned Movement, Indonesia pursues an independent foreign policy prioritizing its national interests. Its strategic position along key maritime trade routes enhances its role in regional stability and global commerce.\nWhile China aims to reduce competitors' influence, Indonesia leverages its relationship with China to negotiate with the US and other advanced economies. However, Indonesia must carefully engage with China to protect its security and sovereignty. President Prabowo has reiterated his commitment to cooperation with China, but this evolving dynamic has overshadowed US diplomatic efforts. For a more effective approach, the US should reassess its policies toward Indonesia and focus on building strong economic partnerships.\nIn recent years, Indonesia has fundamentally redefined its maritime strategy,&nbsp;particularly under former president Joko \u201cJokowi\u201d Widodo\u2019s administration, enhancing its role in the Indo-Pacific with a strategic naval policy. This evolution positions Indonesia as a vital player in regional security and governance.\nAs the US and Indonesia celebrate 75 years of diplomatic ties, their relationship has evolved into a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership (CSP), reinforcing cooperation in addressing global challenges. This partnership is crucial for stability and prosperity, aligning with Indonesia's strategic goals through initiatives like the Indo-Pacific&nbsp;Economic Framework (IPEF). Together, they aim to strengthen maritime security and foster sustainable economic development, paving the way for a resilient future for the region.\nOn Nov. 12, during a formal meeting in Washington, DC, US President Joe Biden and President Prabowo&nbsp;discussed strategic initiatives to build a strong and lasting partnership. They emphasized the critical need to strengthen bilateral defense collaboration to improve regional and global security. A major focus of their discussions was enhancing advanced maritime security capabilities and coordinating operations to combat illegal transnational organized crime.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nThey also placed emphasis on developing integrated intelligence-sharing protocols and creating joint operational frameworks to effectively address emerging security challenges.\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Article\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?\nStop with the LGBTQ scapegoating\nRussia teams up with BRICS to create AI alliance\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nMore in Opinion\nView more\nAcademia\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo\u2019s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nEntertainment\n'Astro Bot' wins highest award at Oscars of video games\nPolitics\nIndonesia to pardon tens of thousands including Papua activists\nAcademia\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?",

(Reuters/Dilara Senkaya)\nJ\nust over a year ago, China gave Bashar al-Assad and his wife a warm welcome during their six-day visit to the country, offering the former Syrian leader a rare break from years of international isolation since the start of a civil war in 2011.\nAs the couple attended the Asian Games, President Xi Jinping vowed to support Assad in \"opposing external interference\" and in Syria's rebuilding, while his wife Asma was feted in Chinese media.\nBut the abrupt end to the rule of the authoritarian leader so explicitly backed by Xi only last year has dealt a blow to China's diplomatic ambitions in the Middle East and exposed the limits of its strategy in the region, analysts say.\nA coalition of rebels seized Syria's capital Damascus on Sunday after a lightning offensive that toppled&nbsp;Assad's regime and ended his family's 50-year dynasty.\n\"There's been a lot of an exaggerated sense of China's ability to shape political outcomes in the region,\" said Jonathan Fulton, a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council.\nWhile the collapse of the Assad regime was seen reducing the influence in the Arab world of his main backers, Iran and Russia, it was also a blow for China's global ambitions, said Fulton.\n\"A lot of what (China has) been doing internationally has relied on support with those countries, and their inability to prop up their biggest partner in the Middle East says quite a lot about their ability to do much beyond the region.\"\nTackling Hotspots&nbsp;\nAfter China brokered a deal between long-time rivals Saudi Arabia and Iran in 2023, Chinese media praised Beijing's rising profile in a neighbourhood long dominated by Washington.&nbsp;\nWang Yi, China's top diplomat, said the country would play a constructive role in handling global \"hotspot issues\".\nChina also brokered a truce between Fatah, Hamas and other rival Palestinian factions earlier this year and has made repeated calls for a ceasefire in Gaza.\nBut despite bringing Middle Eastern leaders to Beijing and rounds of \"shuttle diplomacy\" by its Middle Eastern envoy, Zhai Jun, in the months since, Palestinians have not formed a unity government and the conflict in Gaza continues.\n\"Assad's sudden downfall is not a scenario Beijing wishes to see,\" said Fan Hongda, a Middle East scholar at Shanghai International Studies University. \"China prefers a more stable and independent Middle East, as chaos or a pro-American orientation in the region does not align with China's interests.\"&nbsp;\nThe response by China's foreign ministry to Assad's fall has been muted, focusing on the safety of Chinese nationals and calling for a \"political solution\" to restore stability in Syria as soon as possible.\nMinistry of foreign affairs spokesperson, Mao Ning, on Monday appeared to leave an opening for engagement with the future government: \"China's friendly relations with Syria are for all Syrian people,\" she said.\nChinese experts and diplomats say Beijing will now bide its time before recognising a new government in Damascus.&nbsp;\nIt could use its expertise and financial muscle to support reconstruction, they say, but its commitments are likely to be limited because China has sought to minimise financial risks overseas in recent years.\nSyria joined China's flagship Belt and Road Initiative in 2022, but there have been no significant investments by Chinese firms since, partly due to sanctions.&nbsp;\nChina is \"not really able to fundamentally replace the West either as an economic partner, or diplomatic or military force in the region,\" said Bill Figueroa, assistant professor at the University of Groningen and an expert in China-Middle East relations.\n\"China in 2024 has way less money than China in 2013 - 2014, when the BRI was launched,\" Figueroa said. There is \"an obvious reassessment going on in the direction of safer investments and reducing China's risks overall,\" he added.\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Article\nUN General Assembly calls for 'unconditional' Gaza ceasefire\nPentagon chief urges 'close consultation' between Israel and US on Syria\nIndonesia must regain credibility as an honest broker\nTrump\u2019s second term could deepen Indonesia-China relations\nIndonesia urges citizens to exercise caution during transition of power in Syria\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nMore in World\nView more\nEurope\nUS announces new arms aid package for Ukraine worth $500 million\nMiddle East and Africa\nUS says Israel is acting in Syria for its own defence\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia welcomes UNGA resolution on immediate ceasefire in Gaza\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo\u2019s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nEntertainment\n'Astro Bot' wins highest award at Oscars of video games\nPolitics\nIndonesia to pardon tens of thousands including Papua activists\nAcademia\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?",

(AFP/Pool/Maxim Shipenkov)\nN\nearly three years after his last visit to India in December 2021, Russian President Vladimir Putin will be in New Delhi for the forthcoming reciprocal 23rd annual bilateral summit with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, pending the announcement of specific dates. Putin\u2019s visit will be at Modi\u2019s invitation, which was extended during their bilateral meeting on the sidelines of October\u2019s BRICS Summit in Kazan.\nThe two leaders had met earlier at the 22nd India-Russia summit, held on the sidelines of the Eastern Economic Forum in Russia in July. At that time, both sides reconfirmed their commitment to strengthen their \u201cspecial and privileged\u201d strategic partnership and its historical, time-tested and all-weather nature.\nThe upcoming summit is significant, as Putin\u2019s priority would be to advance multipolarity amid a rapidly changing global order from unipolar dominance to multipolar balance.\nThe declaration of the BRICS Summit in Kazan resembled a testament to building a fairer and more just world order, which will be represented by the voice of the Global South/global majority that remains marginalized in Western-centric international institutions.\nLike China, India is expected to be considered a civilizational state and an important partner in building a multipolar order in the emerging global balance of power led by Russia\u2019s initiative.\nRussian philosopher Alexander Dugin, whose ideas have much influence on the policies of Putin and Moscow, considers China, India and his country as civilizational states, rather than nation-states in the Westphalian model of international relations. For him, multipolarity should be based on dialogue among Russia, China and India as part of the Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa (BRICS) grouping that challenges Western dominance.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nDugin emphasizes the crucial role India can play in the new global order and balance of power, which includes liberation from a colonial mindset and keeping away from West-dominated narratives.\nThe discourse in academic and policy circles, especially in Russia and the Global South, questions Western dominance and the marginalization of non-Western voices and experiences. The debate calls for commitment to diversity, inclusiveness, pluralistic universalism and grounding in world history.\nBesides the NATO expansion to the East, political instability, the rebirth of fascism in Europe and the United States and confronting the new Cold War are the reasons for Russia\u2019s call to build a multipolar world order with the support of Turkey, Egypt, India, China, Brazil, South Africa and others, through Eurasian integration and strengthening multilateral platforms like BRICS, the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation and the Group of 20.\nBRICS is the most crucial institution in the new Cold War and for establishing a multipolar world order. The changing global context and cooperation with Russia in the Global South, especially under the BRICS framework, shows that isolating Russia is difficult.\nRussia is now committed to building a fairer and just multipolar world order as envisioned in the Kazan Declaration, which calls for strengthening multilateralism, enhancing economic cooperation, strengthening people-to-people exchanges, respecting the United Nations Charter and international law, fighting terrorism and climate change, among others.\nA consensus was sought about viewing \u201cunlawful unilateral coercive measures\u201d, such as sanctions, as detrimental to the global economy and Sustainable Development Goals. Therefore, the expanded BRICS agreed to de-dollarize and trade in national currencies.\nPutin sees the current significance of Russia, India and China in the East to confront Containment II, the US' post-Cold War containment policy, in the 21st century, in the same way Lenin observed in 1923 the significance of Russia\u2019s alliance with India and China for ensuring the success of socialism in its struggle against imperialist countries.\nIn the context of the emergence of a multipolar world, former US secretary of state Henry Kissinger said: \u201cIndia will be a fulcrum of 21st-century order: an indispensable element...\u201d\nPutin views that Russia, China and India\u2019s alliance might counter NATO expansion and neoliberal capitalism, strengthen multipolarity and ensure the emergence of a multipolar world order that is more democratic, equitable, prosperous and peaceful.\nIn a recent speech at Valdai International Discussion Club\u2019s plenary meeting in Sochi, Putin said, \u201cIndia should be included in the list of great powers,\u201d considering its fast technological and economic growth.\nThere is speculation that Putin may have played a role in bringing together Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping for a successful meeting at Kazan, where they agreed to keep the overall relationship cooperative, contribute to regional and global peace and act with a long-term view to advancing multipolarity.\nImportantly, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi asserted that Beijing and New Delhi were nonaligned, upheld multilateralism and would contribute to the process of building global multipolarity.\nIndian foreign minister S. Jaishankar, who met Wang on the sidelines of the recent G20 summit in Rio de Janeiro, said the two sides agreed to work together toward rebuilding trust and mutual understanding. Progress would be expected in resuming direct flights, exchanging journalists and facilitating visa issuance.\nAt the 22nd India-Russia summit, Putin and Modi reaffirmed their commitment to the countries\u2019 \u201cspecial and privileged strategic partnership\u201d.\nIndia also adopted a neutral position in the Ukraine-Russia war, urging the latter to resolve the conflict through dialogue and diplomacy in accordance with international law. After the outbreak of war in Ukraine, India-Russia trade expanded considerably.\nIndia is one of the main importers of Russian oil despite pressure from US-Western partners. The target is to increase the trade volume from US$65 billion in 2023 to $100 billion by 2030.\nNext year\u2019s 23rd India-Russia summit will reflect upon and review the partnership, discuss future directions and trajectories and a road map for cooperation toward building global multipolarity. Defense cooperation is the major focus of Russia\u2019s strategic partnership, though trade and economic cooperation is expanding.\nThe writer is an associate professor at Jawaharlal Nehru University\u2019s Centre for Russian and Central Asian Studies.

(JP/Arief Suhardiman)\nD\nonald J. Trump\u2019s reelection as the United States president serves as a reminder that we cannot take the international order for granted. While we respect the choice of the American people, we are all too familiar with the world under his prior administration.\nDuring his first term, the US adopted a more isolationist stance, withdrawing from the Paris Agreement, the United Nations Human Rights Council and the World Health Organization. The US also equally diminished the region\u2019s hopes for stronger trade and diplomatic relations by cancelling the Trans-Pacific Partnership and skipping the ASEAN-related meetings beyond the Manila Summit in 2017. &nbsp;\nWhile it remains uncertain how Trump will steer his second-term administration, the unhealthy geopolitical and geoeconomic ambitions of recent years have damaged global stability and eroded hard-won milestones.\nThe cost has been too high. Victims of humanitarian crises in Gaza, Ukraine, Sudan and elsewhere are left helpless. Measures to combat global challenges such as technological advancement, climate change and health emergencies are hindered by rising protectionist trade measures and industrial policies.\nMeanwhile, many least developed economies are struggling to service unmanageable sovereign debt. These are symptoms of a greater danger and it could threaten Indonesia\u2019s aspiration to become a high-income country by 2045. &nbsp;\nThe world must revive the habit of dialogue and reinforce inclusive principles.

(AFP/Chris Bouroncle)\nH\nuge cranes loom over Peru's massive new Chinese-funded Chancay port, a symbol of Beijing's growing influence in South America which is set to be inaugurated by President Xi Jinping on Thursday.\n\"It's nearly ready,\" Gonzalo Rios, deputy general manager of the Peruvian subsidiary of Chinese port operator Cosco Shipping, which has a 60 percent stake in the facility, said during a recent visit to the deep-water port.\nSituated around 50 miles (80 kilometers) north of the capital Lima, the $3.5 billion complex is expected to become a major hub for trade between South America and China.\nChancay's maximum depth is 17.8 meters (58.4 feet), two meters deeper than Lima's Callao port, making it capable of handling the world's biggest container ships.\n\"With the addition of this port, this part of the Pacific and Peru in particular could become the logistical hub of South America,\" Rios told AFP.\nThe facility will be unveiled by Xi and his Peruvian counterpart Dina Boluarte on the sidelines of this week's Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Lima.\nSouth America's 'Silk Road'&nbsp;\nThe port is the latest addition to the vast collection of railways, highways and other infrastructure projects built under China's massive Belt and Road Initiative.\nLaunched in 2013, the program initially focused on better connecting China with Europe, Africa and the rest of Asia but has since expanded to include South America.\nChancay, a fishing town of around 50,000 inhabitants, was chosen for its strategic location in the heart of South America.\nCosco Shipping Ports, which has a 30-year concession to operate the terminal, has forecast it will handle up to one million containers in its first year of operations.\nChancay is expected to be a major hub for imports of Asian electronics, textiles and other consumer goods and for the export of minerals, including lithium -- a metal used in mobile phone and laptop batteries -- from Chile and copper from both Chile and Peru.\n\"Peru is a source of raw materials for China,\" Oscar Vidarte, professor of international relations at the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru, told AFP.\nBilateral trade between the Asian giant and Peru, one of Latin America's fastest-growing economies for the past decade, stood at nearly $36 billion in 2023, making Peru China's fourth-largest Latin American trading partner.\n\"Our goal is to become the Singapore of Latin America,\" Peruvian Transport Minister Raul Perez told reporters at Chancay.\n\"We will have direct routes to Asia, in particular to China, which will reduce (shipping time) by 10, 15, even 20 days, depending on the route,\" compared to 35-40 days currently, he said.\nChancay port will also serve Chile, Colombia and Ecuador, among other South American countries, allowing them to skirt ports in Mexico and the United States for trade with Asia.\n\"It will allow China to position itself in this part of the world,\" Vidarte said.\nFrancisco Belaunde, a professor in international law at Lima University and other faculties, called it \"part of the battle for geopolitical influence\" in South America pitting China against the United States.\nConnected to the Pan-American highway&nbsp;-- a network of roads linking most of North and South America along the Pacific -- through a mile-long tunnel, the port will use artificial intelligence to inspect containers for drugs and other illicit goods, according to Perez, the transport minister.\nPeru is the world's biggest cocaine producer after Colombia.\nCurrently, much of the drug is smuggled through the port of Guayaquil in neighboring Ecuador.\n\"We will use the most advanced technology to ensure the safety of the containers,\" Perez said.\n&nbsp;\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn

He should not, however, forget East Asia, Pacific and ASEAN countries whose heads of state and government dominated the list of foreign guests attending his inauguration as Indonesia\u2019s eighth president on Oct. 20.\nThe honored guests were visibly pleased when Prabowo called out their full names and titles one by one in his first state address. This has rarely happened in such a state ceremony and can be seen as a trademark for Prabowo\u2019s personal touch. According to Prabowo, 19 heads of state, 19 heads of government and 15 special envoys accepted his invitation.\nPrabowo has grown in prominence internationally since his predecessor Joko \u201cJokowi\u201d Widodo appointed him the defense minister in 2019. After winning the February election, Prabowo toured a number of countries in a show of diplomatic acumen.\n\u201cIn facing the international world, we choose a free and active path, we do not want to join any military pacts. We want to be a good neighbor,\u201d President Prabowo said in his inaugural speech, sending a clear message to his foreign guests.\nEast Asia was represented by South Korean Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, Chinese Vice President Han Zheng and former Japanese foreign minister Masahiko K\u014dmura. As president-elect Prabowo had paid a courtesy call to Chinese President Xi Jinping in Bejing and then Japanese prime minister Fumio Kishida in Tokyo in April. However, Prabowo has not visited Seoul for talks with President Yoon Sook-yeol.\nThe three East Asian nations are Indonesia\u2019s most important trading and economic partners and strategic investment sources. The recurring crisis in the Taiwan Strait, the constant nuclear threats from North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, and the increasing military tensions in the South China Sea are three potential sources of instability in the Indo-Pacific region.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nIn his courtesy call to Vice President\nGibran Rakabuming Raka\n, Han reiterated China\u2019s readiness to \u201ccontinue to deepen the practical cooperation in various fields with the high-quality Belt and Road Initiative [BRI] cooperation taking the lead\u201d.\nHan became the first foreign guest Gibran has received since his inauguration. The young Vice President will need more international exposure, which Prabowo will provide by assigning him to international duties except for major global and multilateral events. Due to his lack of experience in diplomacy, Gibran will need foreign affairs advisors.\nPrabowo has chosen Beijing as the first destination of his inaugural overseas visit. In Beijing Prabowo is scheduled to hold talks with President Xi, amid tension in Indonesia\u2019s exclusive economic zone in Natuna waters, where the Maritime Security Agency (Bakamla) has expelled China Coast Guard vessels three times within the past week.\nDuring his two-week overseas trip, Prabowo will also visit London to meet British PM Keir Starmer and King Charles after attending the APEC and Group of 20 summits in Peru and Brazil, respectively. Prabowo also plans to hold talks with the next United States president.\nPrabowo initially also wished to visit Tokyo again, but as Japan is facing political uncertainty after the new PM Shigeru Ishiba\u2019s ruling party LDP failed to maintain its parliamentary majority, Prabowo decided to postpone the visit. But whoever will be in charge of the Japanese government, even the opposition, Indonesia\u2019s relationship with the world\u2019s fourth-largest economy will remain strong and stable.\nBut what about South Korea? Prabowo has at least a moral obligation to return the attendance of PM Han by making at least a brief visit to Seoul. Han has conveyed an official invitation from President Yoon to President Prabowo. The two countries need to fully settle their stalled military cooperation by seeking a win-win solution while sticking to internationally recognized laws in resolving disputes.\nNow, look at the ASEAN member states, six of whose leaders attended Prabowo\u2019s inauguration. They were Singapore\u2019s PM Lawrence Wong, Malaysian PM Anwar Ibrahim, Brunei\u2019s Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah, Cambodian PM Hun Manet and Philippine President Ferdinand \u201cBongbong\u201d Marcos Jr. They came to show their respect to their new colleague, who had visited them before his inauguration.\nPrabowo wants to go global. But he needs to remember that ASEAN plays a very important role in boosting Indonesia\u2019s influence at the international level. Indonesia cannot go all alone without ASEAN, which has now grown into one of the world\u2019s prominent regional blocs.\nMeanwhile, Pacific countries were represented by New Zealand Deputy PM Winston Peters, Papua New Guinea\u2019s (PNG) PM James Marape, Vanuatu\u2019s PM Charlot Salwai, Timor-Leste\u2019s PM Xanana Gusmao and Solomon Islands\u2019 PM Jeremiah Manele. Indonesia tends to suspect the Pacific region as a major supporter of the Papuan separatist movement and therefore Jakarta\u2019s approach is aimed at keeping the region \u201csilent\u201d about Papua.\nSmall Pacific nations share a strong emotional bond with Papua due to their Melanesian roots. President Prabowo should plan a visit to these nations to build Indonesia\u2019s relationship with them anew. Prabowo has visited PNG, but not yet Timor-Leste, where as a soldier he fought Xanana when the territory was colonized by Indonesia decades ago.\nWhat is also interesting was the attendance of Australia\u2019s Deputy PM and Defense Minister Richard Marles. PM Anthony Albanese promised to attend Prabowo\u2019s inauguration when the Indonesian president-elect visited Canberra in August. However, on Oct. 20, King Charles visited Australia, therefore Albanese assigned his deputy Marles to attend Prabowo\u2019s inauguration on his behalf.\nAustralia once also \u201cblacklisted\u201d Prabowo due to his alleged role in atrocities in then East Timor and other human rights violations. The US only lifted its entry ban of Prabowo when he was appointed Jokowi\u2019s defense minister in 2019.\nApart from making visits, President Prabowo is expected to give a priority to East Asia, ASEAN and the Pacific in his diplomacy. Foreign Minister Sugiono and his three deputies, career diplomats Arrmanatha Christiawan Nasir and Arif Havas Oegroseno and politician Anis Matta, can be assigned to pay more attention to the three regions.\nThe foreign dignitaries who came to Jakarta to witness Prabowo\u2019s ascent to power on Oct. 20 surely expect a payback from Prabowo. They regard Indonesia as a strategic partner and want mutually beneficial relations with the republic.\n***\nThe writer is a senior editor at\nThe Jakarta Post.\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Article\nPresident Prabowo's new coal phase-out goal sets 'daunting task'\nICC\u2019s arrest warrant for Myanmar junta chief is a critical step forward\nPhilippine president says Russian submarine in South China Sea 'worrisome'\nMount Fuji photo spot to get new fences to curb jaywalking\nWill Prabowo emulate Duterte\u2019s approach to South China Sea?\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nMore in Opinion\nView more\nAcademia\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo\u2019s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nEntertainment\n'Astro Bot' wins highest award at Oscars of video games\nPolitics\nIndonesia to pardon tens of thousands including Papua activists\nAcademia\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?",

(AFP/Marty Melvile)\nT\nhe Pacific Islands Forum has been hit by a \"malicious\" hack, the New Zealand government said Thursday, revealing an attack detected ahead of a recent high-stakes summit.&nbsp;\nLeaders from the 18-member bloc travelled to Tonga in August for an annual meeting dominated by the growing Pacific rivalry between China and the United States.\nMonths earlier, with meeting preparations in full swing, staff noticed a computer breach at the forum's headquarters in Fiji.\n\"New Zealand has been briefed on a cyber incident affecting the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat systems,\" a spokesman for New Zealand's foreign minister said on Thursday.\n\"We remain concerned by the growing number of malicious cyber incidents in our region, targeting national entities and regional organizations,\" the spokesman added.\nIt was not clear who was behind the breach, or what information may have been targeted.\nBut it was considered serious enough at the time that a rapid response team of Australian specialists was sent to help at the forum's request.\n\"Responding to cyber threats and building resilience is a priority for Australia, both at home and in our region,\" said Australia's foreign affairs department.&nbsp;\nForum secretary Baron Waqa, who has warned China and the United States to take their \"fight\" out of the Pacific, would address the incident on Friday, a spokeswoman said.&nbsp;\nThe Pacific Islands Forum has captured increased global attention as China vies for regional influence against the United States and its allies.&nbsp;\nIts members include nations with close links to Washington, others who are warmly disposed to Beijing, and some who still maintain diplomatic ties to Taiwan.&nbsp;\nSolomon Islands, China's main partner in the South Pacific, has been lobbying for Taiwan to be stripped of its \"development partner\" status with the forum.&nbsp;\nThe August meeting was notable for a joint declaration that appeared to reaffirm support for Taiwan's limited participation.\nBut this wording immediately raised the ire of Chinese diplomats, who piled pressure on Pacific leaders to amend the document.&nbsp;\nThe forum reissued the declaration without the offending paragraph, which referenced the bloc's long-standing \"relations with Taiwan\".&nbsp;\nIn a subsequent explanation, it said the references to Taiwan had been included by mistake.\nAsked Thursday about reports in Australian media that Beijing was behind the hack on the Pacific Islands Forum, China's foreign ministry slammed it as \"false information, fabricated for political purposes\".\n\"Its aim is to sow discord between countries in the region and China,\" spokeswoman Mao Ning said.\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Article\nNew president and Indonesia\u2019s foreign policy in Pacific\nMehrtens is free.

(AFP/Tang Chinn Sothy)\nC\nhina's top diplomat Wang Yi will visit Russia this week for a security meeting of BRICS emerging economies, Beijing's foreign ministry said Monday.\nWang will attend the meeting of BRICS high-ranking security officials and national security advisers on Wednesday and Thursday in the city of St Petersburg, ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said in an online statement.\nHis visit comes in advance of a BRICS summit next month that President Xi Jinping is expected to attend.\nThe BRICS group, an acronym for Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, represents almost half the world's population and has since expanded to include other major emerging economies including the United Arab Emirates and Iran.\nDuring the talks this week, Wang will discuss the \"current international security situation\", and \"major international and regional issues\" with BRICS officials, Mao said.\n\"The world today is one of interwoven turmoil, and various security challenges are complex and severe,\" she added.\n\"BRICS countries have always been committed to maintaining world peace, promoting common development, practising multilateralism, and promoting global governance in a more just and fair direction.\"\nThe group is set to hold a summit in the southwestern Russian city of Kazan next month, in what the Kremlin hopes will be a chance to expand its influence and forge closer economic alliances.\nRussian President Vladimir Putin last week said he was expecting Xi at the Kazan meeting from October 22 to 24.\nPutin has looked to the Chinese leader for support since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, with the allies boosting trade to record highs as Moscow faces heavy economic sanctions from the West.\nMoscow and Beijing both rail against \"Western hegemony\", particularly what they see as US domination of global affairs, and declared a \"no limits\" partnership shortly before Russia launched its offensive in Ukraine.\nLast month, Putin said Russia's economic and trade links with China were \"yielding results\" as he welcomed Chinese Premier Li Qiang to the Kremlin.\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Article\nHow Syria rebels' stars aligned for Assad's ouster\nWith Assad gone, Middle East battle lines are redrawn\nPutin\u2019s India visit aims to shape global multipolarity\nGive the new FM time\nAustralia, Singapore agree to seek expanded access to their defence facilities\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nMore in World\nView more\nEurope\nUS announces new arms aid package for Ukraine worth $500 million\nMiddle East and Africa\nUS says Israel is acting in Syria for its own defence\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia welcomes UNGA resolution on immediate ceasefire in Gaza\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo\u2019s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nEntertainment\n'Astro Bot' wins highest award at Oscars of video games\nPolitics\nIndonesia to pardon tens of thousands including Papua activists\nAcademia\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?",

(Pool/AFP/Ken Ishii)\nA\nfrican leaders descend on China's capital this week, seeking funds for big-ticket infrastructure projects as they eye mounting great power competition over resources and influence on the continent.\nChina has expanded ties with African nations in the past decade, furnishing them with billions in loans that have helped build infrastructure but also sometimes stoked controversy by saddling countries with huge debts.\nChina has sent hundreds of thousands of workers to Africa to build its megaprojects, while&nbsp;tapping the continent's vast natural resources including copper, gold, lithium and rare earth minerals.\nBeijing has said this week's China-Africa forum will be its largest diplomatic event since the Covid-19 pandemic, with leaders of South Africa, Nigeria, Kenya and other nations confirmed to attend and dozens of delegations expected.\nAfrican countries were \"looking to tap the opportunities in China for growth\", Ovigwe Eguegu, a policy analyst at consultancy Development Reimagined, told AFP.\nChina, the world's number two economy, is Africa's largest trading partner, with bilateral trade hitting US$167.8 billion in the first half of this year, according to Chinese state media.\nProspects\nEvery Monday\nWith exclusive interviews and in-depth coverage of the region's most pressing business issues, \"Prospects\" is the go-to source for staying ahead of the curve in Indonesia's rapidly evolving business landscape.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nBeijing's loans to African nations last year were their highest in five years, research by the Chinese Loans to Africa Database found. Top borrowers were Angola, Ethiopia, Egypt, Nigeria and Kenya.\nBut analysts said an economic slowdown in China has made Beijing increasingly reluctant to shell out big sums.&nbsp;\nChina has also resisted offering debt relief, even as some African nations have struggled to repay their loans -- in some cases being forced to slash spending on vital public services.&nbsp;\nSince the last China-Africa forum six years ago, \"the world experienced a lot of changes, including COVID, geopolitical tension and now these economic challenges\", Tang Xiaoyang of Beijing's Tsinghua University told AFP.\nThe \"old model\" of loans for \"large infrastructure and very rapid industrialization\" is simply no longer feasible, he said.\nThe continent is a key node in Beijing's Belt and Road Initiative, a massive infrastructure project and central pillar of Xi Jinping's bid to expand China's clout overseas.\nThe BRI has channeled much-needed investment to African countries for projects like railways, ports and hydroelectric plants.\nBut critics charge Beijing with saddling nations with debt and funding infrastructure projects that damage the environment.\nOne controversial project in Kenya, a $5 billion railway -- built with finance from Exim Bank of China -- connects the capital Nairobi with the port city of Mombasa.\nBut a second phase meant to continue the line to Uganda never materialized, as both countries struggled to repay BRI debts.\nKenya's President William Ruto last year asked China for a $1 billion loan and the restructuring of existing debt to complete other stalled BRI projects.&nbsp;\nThe country now owes China more than $8 billion.\nRecent deadly protests in Kenya were triggered by the government's need \"to service its debt burden to international creditors, including China\", said Alex Vines, head of the Africa Program at London's Chatham House.\nIn light of such events, Vines and other analysts expect African leaders at this week's forum to seek not only more Chinese investment but also more favorable loans.\nIn central Africa, Western and Chinese firms are racing to secure access to rare minerals.\nThe continent has rich deposits of manganese, cobalt, nickel and lithium -- crucial for renewable energy technology.\nThe Moanda region of Gabon alone contains as much as a quarter of known global reserves of manganese, and South Africa accounts for 37 percent of global output of the metal.\nCobalt mining is dominated by the Democratic Republic of Congo, which accounts for 70 percent of the world total. But in terms of processing, China is the leader, at 50 percent.\nMounting geopolitical tensions between the United States and China, which are clashing over everything from the status of self-ruled Taiwan to trade, also weigh on Africa.\nWashington has warned against what it sees as Beijing's malign influence.\nIn 2022, the White House said China sought to \"advance its own narrow commercial and geopolitical interests [and] undermine transparency and openness\".\nBeijing insists it does not want a new cold war with Washington but rather seeks \"win-win\" cooperation, promoting development while profiting from boosted trade.\n\"We do not just give aid, give them help,\" Tsinghua University's Tang said.\n\"We are just partners with you while you are developing. We are also benefiting from it.\"\nBut analysts fear African nations could be forced to pick sides.&nbsp;\n\"African countries lack leverage against China,\" Development Reimagined's Eguegu said.\n\"Some people [...] think you can use the US to balance China,\" he said. \"You cannot.\"\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Article\nChina\u2019s fast-changing economic adjustments\nGovt eyes 10% investment growth, chipmaking to achieve GDP target\nBiden pushes new Russia, Iran, Korea, China effort before Trump term\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources\nGovt halts big infrastructure in trade-off for food security: Minister\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nMore in Business\nView more\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nTech\nMinister says Apple 'losing out' by dragging its feet on $1b investment\nRegulations\nMinistry inks collab with army, police on food security\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo\u2019s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nEntertainment\n'Astro Bot' wins highest award at Oscars of video games\nPolitics\nIndonesia to pardon tens of thousands including Papua activists\nAcademia\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?",

(AFP/Pavel Volkov)\nR\nussian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping were set to participate Thursday in a regional summit in Central Asia bringing together numerous countries opposed to the West.\nPutin and Xi regularly meet under the aegis of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) alliance, whose latest session is being held in Kazakhstan's capital city of Astana.&nbsp;\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is also attending, since his country is a \"dialogue partner\" with the bloc, whose full members including ex-Soviet Central Asian states, India, China, Russia and Iran.\nOn Wednesday, Putin had bilateral meetings with Erdogan and Xi ahead of the main session, telling the Chinese leader that the Shanghai alliance was strengthening its role as \"one of the key pillars of a fair multipolar world order\".\nBoth countries have railed against what they call US-led \"hegemony\" on the world stage.\nXi, criticised in the West for his growing support for Moscow, told Putin Wednesday he was delighted to see his \"old friend\" again.\nErdogan also met Putin on the sidelines Wednesday, inviting him to Turkey and calling for a \"fair peace that can satisfy both sides\" in Ukraine. The Turkish leader has sought to mediate between the warring countries.\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is not attending.\nCompetition with West&nbsp;\nThe SCO was founded in 2001 but has come to prominence in recent years. Its nine full member countries are China, India, Iran, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Pakistan and Tajikistan.\nIt is intended to be a platform for cooperation in competition with the West, with a focus on security and economics.\nA year after Western-sanctioned Iran joined as a full member, Belarus, also ostracised for its backing for Russia's war in Ukraine, will become the 10th full member Thursday.\nBelarusian President Alexander Lukashenko in an interview with Kazakh media praised the alliance for \"demonstrating to the world that there are alternative international platforms, different centres of power\".\nThe alliance claims to represent 40 percent of the global population and about 30 percent of its GDP but it is a disparate group with many internal disagreements including territorial disputes.\nWhile Russia and China are united against Western domination, they are economic competitors in Central Asia, a region rich in oil and gas that is also a crucial transport route between Asia and Europe.\nAlternative routes&nbsp;\nThe summit includes Gulf states among its \"dialogue partners\" and in a sign of its growing importance, United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres is set to address delegates Thursday.\nWith the event's security focus, Afghanistan is a likely topic. It has observer status in the SCO but has been absent since the Taliban took power in 2021.\nNone of the members have formally recognised the Taliban government but China has named an ambassador to Kabul, Kazakhstan has removed the Taliban from its list of banned organisations and Moscow has said it will do the same.\nBut the SCO's main thrust is economic ties between member countries and developing giant projects to link up China and Europe via Central Asia.&nbsp;\nRussia's invasion of Ukraine has increased major powers' interest in the region, where Moscow is seeking to maintain its traditional sway but where China now has strong ties through its flagship Belt and Road infrastructure project, while the West is also vying for influence.\nWestern sanctions against Russia have blocked much-used transport links between China and Europe and prompted the European Union to seek alternative routes including through Central Asia.\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Article\nPreparing for total war\nAssad's fall in Syria exposes limits of China's Middle East diplomacy\nGive the new FM time\nTrump threatens 100 percent tariff on BRICS countries\nChina says top military official Miao Hua suspended, under investigation\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nMore in World\nView more\nEurope\nUS announces new arms aid package for Ukraine worth $500 million\nMiddle East and Africa\nUS says Israel is acting in Syria for its own defence\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia welcomes UNGA resolution on immediate ceasefire in Gaza\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo\u2019s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nEntertainment\n'Astro Bot' wins highest award at Oscars of video games\nPolitics\nIndonesia to pardon tens of thousands including Papua activists\nAcademia\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?",

(Pool/AFP/Asanka Ratnayake)\nC\nhinese Premier Li Qiang mixed a dash of \"panda diplomacy\" with a visit to a historic vineyard on Sunday to celebrate a thaw in once-icy trade ties with Australia.\nThe highest ranking Chinese official to visit Australia in seven years, Li's four-day trip offers the prospect of greater trade after Beijing lifted punitive measures against a string of major Australian exports.\nChina is by far Australia's biggest trading partner, taking in nearly 30 percent of its exports last year including major commodities iron ore and coal.\nTwo-way trade reached A$327 billion (US$216 billion) in 2023.\nSetting the warmer tone, Li took a trip to Adelaide Zoo in bright sunshine and announced China would loan new \"adorable\" giant pandas to replace popular pair Wang Wang and Fu Ni.\nThe Adelaide pandas, which have failed to produce offspring since their arrival in 2009, will return to China by the end of the year.\nProspects\nEvery Monday\nWith exclusive interviews and in-depth coverage of the region's most pressing business issues, \"Prospects\" is the go-to source for staying ahead of the curve in Indonesia's rapidly evolving business landscape.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\n\"I guess they must have missed their home a lot,\" said Li, the second most powerful man in China after President Xi Jinping.\nThe premier said China made the panda offer to honour the wishes of Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong, an Adelaide resident who has worked to stabilise the relationship with Beijing.\nWong said her own children would be \"very happy\" at the news, which she welcomed as a \"symbol of goodwill\".\nLi then joined Wong for a lunch at the 19th century Magill Estate vineyard, home of the original Penfolds winery and now part of the Australian global winemaker Treasury Wine Estates.\nWine was among a string of Australian exports, along with coal, timber, barley, beef, and lobsters, battered by Chinese sanctions in 2020 during a diplomatic rift with the former conservative government.\nThose sanctions cost Australian exporters an estimated A$20 billion a year, including A$1 billion for the wine industry.\nThe tariffs have been gradually lifted since Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's government took power in 2022 and adopted a softer diplomatic approach towards China. Lobster is one of the few exports still facing trade barriers.\nLi and Albanese are set to hold talks behind closed doors in Canberra on Monday, encompassing fractious issues of foreign influence, human rights, alleged \"unsafe\" behaviour by China's military in the region, and their rivalry in the Pacific.\nChina's growing clout in the South Pacific, where it seeks to expand security and economic ties with island states traditionally allied with Australia, remains a notable point of tension.\n\"We're in a state of permanent contest in the Pacific. That's the reality,\" Wong told a television interviewer Sunday.\nBut the Chinese premier, who will also head to a lithium mine in Perth, is focusing his attention on economic opportunities despite areas of friction.\n\"Mutual respect, seeking common ground while shelving differences and mutually beneficial cooperation\" are key to the relationship, Li said on his arrival in Adelaide on Saturday.\nAustralia has endured \"a long period of deep freeze, where it was not possible to have any sort of official conversations with China\", said Melissa Conley Tyler, honorary fellow at the University of Melbourne's Asia Institute.&nbsp;\nLi's visit sends a message that \"Australia is back to being seen as a friendly country rather than the unfriendly, hostile country we were seen as during those years of maximum tension,\" she told AFP.\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Article\nOfficials to form new import task force separate from Trade Ministry\nForeign Minister Sugiono lists priorities in debut meeting with lawmakers\nChina's Xi calls for more free trade\nHow a second Trump presidency will impact Indonesia\u2019s economy\nRubio pick signals a Trump China policy that could go beyond tariffs\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nMore in Business\nView more\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nTech\nMinister says Apple 'losing out' by dragging its feet on $1b investment\nRegulations\nMinistry inks collab with army, police on food security\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo\u2019s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nEntertainment\n'Astro Bot' wins highest award at Oscars of video games\nPolitics\nIndonesia to pardon tens of thousands including Papua activists\nAcademia\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?",

Chung Sung-Jun/Pool via REUTERS (Reuters/Chung Sung-Jun)\nI\nn their joint declaration that capped their&nbsp;trilateral summit on May 27, host South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and Chinese Premier Li Qiang paid much attention to the strategic importance of ASEAN, apparently because the three leaders found it impossible to find common ground on North Korea, the Taiwan Strait and other regional security threats.\nOne of the prominent examples of their common view on ASEAN is their agreement to use the ASEAN-led Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), billed as the world\u2019s largest free trade agreement, as the basis for&nbsp;their negotiations to reach a much more sophisticated trade pact among them.\nAccording to media reports, the three East Asian leaders agreed to \"keep discussions for speeding up negotiations for a Trilateral FTA\".\nIn their joint statement, the three leaders affirmed \u201cthe importance of ensuring implementation in a transparent, smooth and effective manner of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) Agreement as the basis of a Trilateral Free Trade Agreement (FTA)\u201d.\n\u201cWe will keep discussions for speeding up negotiations for a Trilateral FTA, aiming at realizing a free, fair, comprehensive, high-quality, and mutually beneficial FTA with its own value,\u201d the joint statement reads.\nIt remains too early to get a clearer picture of how ASEAN nations will benefit from the political rapprochement among their northeastern&nbsp;neighbors, which are among their most important trading and investment partners. China and Japan&nbsp;have been competing for influence in&nbsp;Southeast Asia, while South Korea is smartly playing the alternative role thanks to its advanced technology.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nJapanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has softened his ambition to revive the stalled free trade scheme, the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), which was originally aimed at, among other goals, containing China in what was supposed to be&nbsp;close collaboration with the United States.\nIt seems the turnaround has helped the Japanese leader achieve&nbsp;major progress in the negotiation of the trilateral free trade agreement during the Seoul summit. The talks stalled in 2019 because of China\u2019s objections.\nChina, the world\u2019s second-largest economy, Japan, the fourth, and South Korea, the 14\nth\n, are parties to the RCEP, which was approved in 2020 but came into effect on Jan. 1, 2022. Aside from the 10-member ASEAN, other signatories of the legally binding agreement are Australia and New Zealand.\nKishida said, as quoted by the Japanese Foreign Ministry, that Japan intends to have a candid exchange of views on how a future-oriented trilateral free trade agreement should be organized, including&nbsp;high-level economic discipline&nbsp;among the three countries, which have deep ties in both trade and investment, aiming for an RCEP-plus agreement.\nAs recently as February, Japan and the US had supported&nbsp;the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), which grouped mostly Western countries and sought to contain China. However, under president Donald Trump in 2016, Washington axed the TPP.&nbsp;\nHoping the US would return to the trade bloc someday, Japan and Australia sponsored the CPTPP. But later they realized that the US would never come back. As if to add insult to injury, China applied to join the new trade bloc.\nThe CPTPP was practically dead when Joe Biden took office in January 2021. The US president opted not to revive the TPP because of strong domestic opposition to the trade pact.\nBiden then proposed the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF), which did not need the approval of&nbsp;Congress. ASEAN countries accepted the invitation to join the new group more as a matter of diplomatic courtesy to Biden.\nDuring the Seoul summit, the three East Asian leaders expressed their commitment to a closer relationship with ASEAN, one of the world\u2019s most powerful regional organizations and which continues to attract attention from global powers, including the US and its allies.\nChinese Premier Li Qiang praised what he called a restart in relations with Japan and South Korea as he met President Yoon and PM Kishida for the first three-way talks&nbsp;in four years, agreeing to revive trade and security dialogues hampered by global tensions.\n\"For China, South Korea&nbsp;and Japan, our close ties will not change, the spirit of cooperation achieved through crisis response will not change and our mission to safeguard regional peace and stability will not change,\" Li said as quoted by Reuters.\nLi also emphasized close ties with ASEAN, given the region\u2019s stability and stellar economic performance.\n\u201cChina, Japan and South Korea should leverage their respective development strengths to create a new engine for regional cooperation that actively addresses the needs of ASEAN and other neighboring countries. The three countries should work together to boost the momentum of ASEAN Plus Three cooperation,\u201d Premier Li said, as quoted by Xinhua.\nASEAN+3 refers to a dialogue forum involving&nbsp;ASEAN,&nbsp;China, Japan and South Korea that. was initiated in December 1997 and has since evolved to be&nbsp;the main vehicle to promote East Asian cooperation.\nKishida concurred, acknowledging ASEAN\u2019s pivotal role in maintaining peace in the Indo-Pacific region, where great power&nbsp;rivalry is simmering.\n\u201cASEAN plays a central role in regional stability and prosperity and also welcomes the revitalization of the trilateral process. It is thus more and more important for the three countries to cooperate with ASEAN for mainstreaming ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific [AOIP]&nbsp;in order to bring about stability and prosperity in the region,\u201d&nbsp;Kishida said.\nIt remains to be seen how ASEAN will seize the opportunities up for grabs following the Seoul trilateral summit. ASEAN could&nbsp;be an unlikely beneficiary of&nbsp;the tensions and competition among its&nbsp;three northeastern neighbors.\nFor Indonesia, the new development is&nbsp;low hanging fruit, especially for the incoming government. President-elect\nPrabowo Subianto\nhas visited China and Japan. A South Korean tour will only make perfect sense.\n***\nThe writer is a senior editor at\nThe Jakarta Post.\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Article\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nRussia teams up with BRICS to create AI alliance\nBiden pushes new Russia, Iran, Korea, China effort before Trump term\nSeoul stocks drop on S.

(Reuters/pool/Chung Sung-Jun) (Reuters/Chung Sung-Jun)\nVersi Bahasa Indonesia\nAfter stalling for more than four years, South Korea, China and Japan finally held their annual trilateral summit on Monday in Seoul. Although the conference saw no substantial progress in the efforts to address politically sensitive issues, the fact that the leaders of the three countries were willing to convene at all contributed much to a meaningful reduction of tension and distrust among them.\nThe 8th Trilateral Business Summit brought together South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol as the host, Chinese Premier Li Qiang and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida.\nWhile President Xi Jinping's absence might raise questions about Beijing's genuine commitment to the relationship with its two neighbors, it is common practice for either the president or the premier to represent China at multilateral meetings.\nThe situation in Northeast Asia is very dangerous. North Korean leader Kim Jong-un is threatening nuclear war, and China is trying to take over Taiwan under a reunification narrative. These are among the reasons that war could break out in the region. Meanwhile, Beijing, Tokyo and Seoul are at odds with each other.\nThe world watched as the leaders shook hands, discussed issues and made a joint declaration. The three countries are the most important trading and economic partners of ASEAN.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nSoutheast Asian countries closely follow the development of their very wealthy northeastern neighbors: China is the world\u2019s second-largest economy, followed by Japan and South Korea, and their combined GDP accounts for more than 20 percent of the global GDP.\nIndonesia considers the China, Japan and South Korea as its most important investors and trading partners and crucial to its economy. This is why the three countries are always on the mind of any Indonesian president.\nIn their joint declaration, Yoon, Kishida and Li said maintaining peace, stability and prosperity on the Korean Peninsula and in Northeast Asia were in everyone's interest. They also agreed to the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and to make positive efforts for the political settlement of the peninsula\u2019s issue.\nDespite differing views on the two main issues and the reluctance of Yoon and Kishida to distance themselves from their main military ally the United States, as Beijing has often requested, the meeting made progress on a number of fronts.\nIn a surprising turn of events, Pyongyang announced hours before the summit that it would soon put a much more deadly spy satellite into orbit. The announcement was not well received by either Yoon or Kishida and it also caused concern for Li, whose country is the most important trading partner and North Korea\u2019s only ally.\nIt is to be expected that any political or military instability and tension will have both direct and indirect impacts on the 10-member ASEAN. It would be remiss not to mention the fact that the three countries, in particular China and Japan, are engaged in a high-level competition to boost their influence and power among economically weaker nations. ASEAN is also becoming increasingly concerned about Beijing\u2019s assertiveness in the South China Sea.\nThe three leaders said they wanted to work more with the regional bloc through the ASEAN Regional Forum and the East Asia Summit. They also talked about the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) led by ASEAN, the world\u2019s second-largest trading bloc. All three major economies are part of the RCEP.\nDespite their disagreements and different approaches, the summit made progress in economy and trade, climate change, people-to-people exchanges, science and health, and aging populations.\nPresident Yoon deserves a pat on the back for successfully completing the pretty tough mission of bringing the three countries together. This was definitely a big win. And the three leaders made some progress, even if it wasn't earth-shattering.\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Article\nASEAN ministers to discuss Myanmar at Thailand meeting, Indonesia says\nChina sends naval, air forces to shadow US plane over Taiwan Strait\nPrabowo mulls extending tour to Middle East\nXi, Biden attend APEC summit, prepare to meet\nPrabowo lands in Peru for APEC Summit\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nMore in Opinion\nView more\nAcademia\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo\u2019s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nEntertainment\n'Astro Bot' wins highest award at Oscars of video games\nPolitics\nIndonesia to pardon tens of thousands including Papua activists\nAcademia\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?",

He has voiced support for developing closer ties with Beijing.\nWang also met Indonesian foreign minister Retno LP Marsudi earlier on Thursday before visiting Jokowi at the presidential palace and then Prabowo at the defense ministry.\nRetno said Jokowi and Wang expressed their desire for regional peace and stability, and repeated calls for a de-escalation and ceasefire in Gaza between Israel and Hamas.\n\"Mr. President emphasized no one would like to see any escalation,\" she told reporters after the meeting.\n\"China's and Indonesia's position are the same on this issue and Mr. President also conveyed his belief that China would also use its influence to prevent escalation.\"\nBeijing's top diplomat will then chair a session of the China-Indonesia High-level Dialogue Cooperation Mechanism on Friday before traveling to Cambodia and Papua New Guinea.\nChina is one of the biggest sources of foreign direct investment in Indonesia and has poured billions of dollars into projects in the archipelago nation.\nIndonesia's foreign policy is typically neutral and Jakarta walks a delicate diplomatic tightrope in its relations between Beijing and Washington, who are chafing over trade, Ukraine, the Middle East, Taiwan and the South China Sea.\nChinese companies have plowed money into the extraction of Indonesian natural resources in recent years, particularly the nickel sector where Beijing's spending has stoked unrest over pay and working conditions.\nJakarta inaugurated Southeast Asia's first high-speed rail line last year, also a multi billion-dollar project backed by Beijing.\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Article\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nPrabowo would \u2018respect\u2019 PDI-P as opposition\nMinistry inks collab with army, police on food security\nMission to Syria\nBiden pushes new Russia, Iran, Korea, China effort before Trump term\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nMore in World\nView more\nEurope\nUS announces new arms aid package for Ukraine worth $500 million\nMiddle East and Africa\nUS says Israel is acting in Syria for its own defence\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia welcomes UNGA resolution on immediate ceasefire in Gaza\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo\u2019s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nEntertainment\n'Astro Bot' wins highest award at Oscars of video games\nPolitics\nIndonesia to pardon tens of thousands including Papua activists\nAcademia\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?",

(AFP/Kay Nietfeld)\nG\nerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz arrived in China on Sunday, kicking off a trip in which he faces a tough balancing act as he aims to shore up economic ties with Berlin's biggest trading partner.\nScholz touched down in the southwestern megacity of Chongqing on Sunday morning, Chinese state broadcaster CCTV said, accompanied by a large delegation of ministers and business executives.\nAs Western allies are cranking up pressure on Beijing, Scholz is expected to underline that Germany remains committed to doing business with the world's second-largest economy and rejects US-led calls for \"decoupling\".\nHis friendly overtures towards China risk sparking ire among Washington and EU partners, which have been pushing back against Beijing's heavy subsidies for industries.&nbsp;\n\"China remains a really important economic partner,\" Scholz told journalists on Friday, adding that he would try to level the playing field for German companies in China.\nOn the geopolitical front, Scholz will also use his visit to persuade Chinese President Xi Jinping to exert his influence to rein in his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin and help bring an end to the war in Ukraine.\n\"Given the close relations between China and Russia, Beijing has the possibility to exert its influence on Russia,\" said a German government source in Berlin.\nThe three-day tour through Chongqing, Shanghai and Beijing is Scholz's second trip to China since he took office.\nHis first in November 2022 took place under intense scrutiny, as it came swiftly after Xi strengthened his grip on power, and marked the first post-pandemic visit by a G7 leader to China.\nStung then by painful supply chain disruptions during the health crisis as well as by China's refusal to distance itself from Russia despite Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, Western allies had been scrambling to reduce their reliance on Beijing.\n'Position of strength'&nbsp;\nScholz's visit comes as many of Germany's Western allies confront China on a range of trade issues.\nA slew of probes into state aid for Chinese solar panels, electric cars and wind turbines are ongoing in Brussels.\nThe United States is meanwhile investigating national security risks posed by Chinese technology in cars.\nWith tensions rumbling over Taiwan, US President Joe Biden this week made defence pledges to Japan and the Philippines, while describing behaviour by Beijing in the South China Sea as \"dangerous and aggressive\".\nTwo days before his visit, Scholz held talks with France's President Emmanuel Macron, whose office said the leaders \"coordinated to defend a rebalancing of European-Chinese trade relations\".\nBut China is a vital market for Germany, where many jobs depend directly on demand from the Asian giant.\nBoth economies also badly need a boost.\nThe German economy shrank by 0.3 percent last year, battered by inflation, high interest rates and cooling exports, and for this year, the economy ministry expects just an anaemic growth of 0.2 percent.&nbsp;\nBeijing has set an annual GDP growth target of around five percent for this year, but exports plunged more than expected last month.&nbsp;\nGerman MPs and analysts urged Scholz to take a firm line.\nThe Green party's Deborah Duering warned Scholz against viewing China just as an economic opportunity.\n\"Those who ignore long-term risks for short-term profits risk repeating the mistakes of the past, misguided Russia policy,\" said Duering, in reference to past dependency on Moscow for cheap energy supplies.\nMax Zenglein of the Mercator Institute for China Studies said Germany should not hesitate to be more assertive.\n\"As countries such as the USA and Japan are positioning themselves much more sharply against China, Germany has an important role to play,\" he said, adding that Germany was \"in a position of strength\".\n&nbsp;\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Article\nNavigating Indonesia-US relations amid global and domestic changes\nLuigi Mangione was charged with murder -

(Reuters/Florence Lo)\nA\nnational election in the Solomon Islands, the first since Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare signed a security pact with Beijing, will be watched next week for its potential to jolt the United States-China rivalry in the South Pacific.\nThe US and Australia are concerned about China's naval ambitions in Pacific countries, as tensions rise over Taiwan.\nDespite its population of just 700,000, the Solomon Islands occupies a strategic position 1,600 kilometers northeast of Australia, strewn with World War Two wrecks that remind it was once a pivotal battlefield.\nVoters will be focused on hospitals struggling without medicines, education shortcomings and inadequate roads when they cast ballots on Wednesday, April 17, opposition party lawmakers said.\nBut Sogavare's rapid embrace of China since he won power four years ago \u2014 including inviting Chinese police into the archipelago and switching diplomatic ties from Taiwan \u2014 is also in the spotlight.\n\"The services and economy are really in a desperate situation. The issue of China and this new relationship is also important. That is a source of anger towards Sogavare,\" said Democratic Alliance Party leader Rick Houenipwela, who was prime minister before Sogavare.\nSogavare, installed as prime minister by independent candidates who won a combined 37% of the vote in 2019, has pointed to hosting the Pacific Games as a major achievement and pledged to strengthen relations with China.\nChina donated stadiums for the Games, and is building ports, roads and a Huawei telecommunications network.\nOpposition parties said they would scrap the China security pact or hold a national referendum on it, and reduce China's influence by accepting more infrastructure support from US allies.\n&nbsp;\n'Not convinced'\nPeter Kenilorea, whose United Party won 10 percent of votes in 2019, said he wants Solomon Islands to return to being a reliable partner of Australia and New Zealand, and would abolish the China security pact.\n\"We're not convinced it's in the interests of Solomon Islands,\" he said.\nClosely watched will be election results in Malaita, the most populous province, which has long criticized deepening China ties and is where opposition parties hope to gain nine seats.\nMalaita's governor Daniel Suidani refused to allow Chinese companies to operate in the province until he was ousted in a no-confidence vote in 2023.\nHis replacement, Martin Fini, has signed Chinese cooperation deals, including last week, when China's special envoy for the Pacific Qian Bo visited Malaita.\nThe prime minister is selected by winning lawmakers, often weeks after the election results.\nHouenipwela's party has formed a coalition with Matthew Wale's Solomon Islands Democratic Party, which won the biggest vote (14 percent) in 2019, and is seeking a combined majority of 26 seats.\nAustralian National University Pacific expert Graeme Smith said the shift away independents was a significant development this election, with Sogavare also convincing many government members to join his new party.\nAustralia has sent 400 police and military to assist Royal Solomon Islands Police Force (RSIPF) with election security, alongside New Zealand and Pacific forces. Chinese police will remain in a training role, the RSIPF said.\nElection observer groups from Australia, New Zealand, the Pacific, Japan, Europe and the US will monitor voting and counting, with national and provincial polls held on the same day.\nSogavare, who didn't respond to a request for comment, has said publicly he would not host a Chinese military base \u2014 which Washington and Canberra have said is a red line.\nChina says its security cooperation Solomon Islands is a sovereign matter for the two countries and has denied it wants a military base, but US military leaders remain unconvinced.\n\"The increased policing presence in the Solomon Islands is concerning, that's a foot in the door, and then we'll see where it goes from there,\" commander of the US Indo Pacific Command, Adm. John Aquilino, said in an interview.\n\"But the goal is to have the ability to deliver infrastructure and ultimately a place for Chinese military power.\"\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Article\nAustralia to charge tech companies for news content if they do not pay\nBiden pushes new Russia, Iran, Korea, China effort before Trump term\nDharma\u2019s surprising uptick in support reflects growing protest votes\nRidwan gears up for runoff despite rival claiming single-round victory\nIndonesian government aims to return foreign prisoners by January\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nMore in World\nView more\nEurope\nUS announces new arms aid package for Ukraine worth $500 million\nMiddle East and Africa\nUS says Israel is acting in Syria for its own defence\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia welcomes UNGA resolution on immediate ceasefire in Gaza\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo\u2019s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nEntertainment\n'Astro Bot' wins highest award at Oscars of video games\nPolitics\nIndonesia to pardon tens of thousands including Papua activists\nAcademia\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?",

(JP/Deni Ghifari)\nI\nn November, President\nPrabowo Subianto\nvisited China, the United States, Peru, Brazil, the United Kingdom and United Arab Emirates (UAE)&nbsp;to strengthen bilateral and multilateral ties, highlighting Indonesia's growing influence in Asia and the Americas.\nAs 2025 approaches, the global landscape remains multipolar, with rising US-China&nbsp;tensions. Following the Non-Aligned Movement, Indonesia pursues an independent foreign policy prioritizing its national interests. Its strategic position along key maritime trade routes enhances its role in regional stability and global commerce.\nWhile China aims to reduce competitors' influence, Indonesia leverages its relationship with China to negotiate with the US and other advanced economies. However, Indonesia must carefully engage with China to protect its security and sovereignty. President Prabowo has reiterated his commitment to cooperation with China, but this evolving dynamic has overshadowed US diplomatic efforts. For a more effective approach, the US should reassess its policies toward Indonesia and focus on building strong economic partnerships.\nIn recent years, Indonesia has fundamentally redefined its maritime strategy,&nbsp;particularly under former president Joko \u201cJokowi\u201d Widodo\u2019s administration, enhancing its role in the Indo-Pacific with a strategic naval policy. This evolution positions Indonesia as a vital player in regional security and governance.\nAs the US and Indonesia celebrate 75 years of diplomatic ties, their relationship has evolved into a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership (CSP), reinforcing cooperation in addressing global challenges. This partnership is crucial for stability and prosperity, aligning with Indonesia's strategic goals through initiatives like the Indo-Pacific&nbsp;Economic Framework (IPEF). Together, they aim to strengthen maritime security and foster sustainable economic development, paving the way for a resilient future for the region.\nOn Nov. 12, during a formal meeting in Washington, DC, US President Joe Biden and President Prabowo&nbsp;discussed strategic initiatives to build a strong and lasting partnership.

(AFP/Alexander Nemenov)\nP\nresident Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday that Russia would develop artificial intelligence with BRICS partners and other countries,&nbsp;in&nbsp;a bid to challenge the dominance of the United States in one of the most promising and crucial technologies of the 21st century.\nSpeaking at Russia's flagship AI conference, Putin said the new AI Alliance Network would include national associations and development institutions in the field of AI from BRICS countries and other interested states.&nbsp;\n\"Russia must participate on equal terms in the global race to create strong artificial intelligence. It is precisely the advanced solutions that Russian scientists are currently working on,\" Putin told an AI conference in Moscow.&nbsp;\n\"We invite scientists from all over the world to join in the collaboration,\" he added.\nWestern sanctions intended to restrict Russia's access to the technologies it needs to sustain its war against Ukraine have resulted in the world's major producers of microchips halting exports to Russia, sorely limiting its AI ambitions.\nRussia's dominant lender Sberbank is spearheading AI development in Russia, but&nbsp;Sberbank CEO German Gref acknowledged in 2023 that graphics processing units (GPUs), the microchips that underpin AI development, were the trickiest hardware for Russia to replace.&nbsp;\nOn Wednesday, the bank said national AI associations from BRICS members Brazil, China, India and South Africa, but also from Serbia,&nbsp;Indonesia&nbsp;and other non-BRICS countries, had joined the AI Alliance Network.\nIt said the network would facilitate joint research into technology and AI regulation, and&nbsp;provide opportunities for AI products&nbsp;to be sold in&nbsp;member countries' markets.\nThe United States and China are the world's top AI powers, and US President-elect Donald Trump has named a \"White House AI and Crypto Czar\" to help ensure the United States remains the richest and most technologically advanced power in the world.\nBut Putin's move to ally with China could change the dynamics of the AI race.\nRussia is one of 10 countries, including the US, China, Britain and Israel, that are developing their own generative AI models. The Yakov and Partners consultancy, run by former McKinsey employees in Moscow, says this gives it the potential to become a much more significant player.\nRussia sees the use of AI technologies across all sectors adding 11.2 trillion roubles ($109 billion) to gross domestic product in 2030, compared to 0.2 trillion roubles ($1.9 billion) in 2023.&nbsp;\nIts AI strategy also says that 80 percent of all Russian workers should have AI skills by 2030, compared with 5 percent in 2023, while AI investment should grow seven-fold to 850 billion roubles.&nbsp;\nSberbank, which has developed a generative AI model called GigaChat, and technology leader Yandex, with its YandexGPT model, dominate Russia's domestic AI market.&nbsp;\nRussia currently ranks 31st of 83 countries by AI implementation, innovation and investment on UK-based Tortoise Media's Global AI Index, well behind not only the United States and China but also fellow BRICS members India and Brazil.&nbsp;\nStanford University's AI vibrancy tool, which evaluates 36 countries based on 42 AI indicators including research and development, ranks Russia 29th.\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Article\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nChina\u2019s fast-changing economic adjustments\nChinese guards on the ground in Myanmar could go disastrously wrong\nTrump's unorthodox cabinet picks test party loyalty\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nMore in World\nView more\nEurope\nUS announces new arms aid package for Ukraine worth $500 million\nMiddle East and Africa\nUS says Israel is acting in Syria for its own defence\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia welcomes UNGA resolution on immediate ceasefire in Gaza\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo\u2019s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nEntertainment\n'Astro Bot' wins highest award at Oscars of video games\nPolitics\nIndonesia to pardon tens of thousands including Papua activists\nAcademia\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?",

(Reuters/Dilara Senkaya)\nJ\nust over a year ago, China gave Bashar al-Assad and his wife a warm welcome during their six-day visit to the country, offering the former Syrian leader a rare break from years of international isolation since the start of a civil war in 2011.\nAs the couple attended the Asian Games, President Xi Jinping vowed to support Assad in \"opposing external interference\" and in Syria's rebuilding, while his wife Asma was feted in Chinese media.\nBut the abrupt end to the rule of the authoritarian leader so explicitly backed by Xi only last year has dealt a blow to China's diplomatic ambitions in the Middle East and exposed the limits of its strategy in the region, analysts say.\nA coalition of rebels seized Syria's capital Damascus on Sunday after a lightning offensive that toppled&nbsp;Assad's regime and ended his family's 50-year dynasty.\n\"There's been a lot of an exaggerated sense of China's ability to shape political outcomes in the region,\" said Jonathan Fulton, a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council.\nWhile the collapse of the Assad regime was seen reducing the influence in the Arab world of his main backers, Iran and Russia, it was also a blow for China's global ambitions, said Fulton.\n\"A lot of what (China has) been doing internationally has relied on support with those countries, and their inability to prop up their biggest partner in the Middle East says quite a lot about their ability to do much beyond the region.\"\nTackling Hotspots&nbsp;\nAfter China brokered a deal between long-time rivals Saudi Arabia and Iran in 2023, Chinese media praised Beijing's rising profile in a neighbourhood long dominated by Washington.&nbsp;\nWang Yi, China's top diplomat, said the country would play a constructive role in handling global \"hotspot issues\".\nChina also brokered a truce between Fatah, Hamas and other rival Palestinian factions earlier this year and has made repeated calls for a ceasefire in Gaza.\nBut despite bringing Middle Eastern leaders to Beijing and rounds of \"shuttle diplomacy\" by its Middle Eastern envoy, Zhai Jun, in the months since, Palestinians have not formed a unity government and the conflict in Gaza continues.\n\"Assad's sudden downfall is not a scenario Beijing wishes to see,\" said Fan Hongda, a Middle East scholar at Shanghai International Studies University. \"China prefers a more stable and independent Middle East, as chaos or a pro-American orientation in the region does not align with China's interests.\"&nbsp;\nThe response by China's foreign ministry to Assad's fall has been muted, focusing on the safety of Chinese nationals and calling for a \"political solution\" to restore stability in Syria as soon as possible.\nMinistry of foreign affairs spokesperson, Mao Ning, on Monday appeared to leave an opening for engagement with the future government: \"China's friendly relations with Syria are for all Syrian people,\" she said.\nChinese experts and diplomats say Beijing will now bide its time before recognising a new government in Damascus.&nbsp;\nIt could use its expertise and financial muscle to support reconstruction, they say, but its commitments are likely to be limited because China has sought to minimise financial risks overseas in recent years.\nSyria joined China's flagship Belt and Road Initiative in 2022, but there have been no significant investments by Chinese firms since, partly due to sanctions.&nbsp;\nChina is \"not really able to fundamentally replace the West either as an economic partner, or diplomatic or military force in the region,\" said Bill Figueroa, assistant professor at the University of Groningen and an expert in China-Middle East relations.\n\"China in 2024 has way less money than China in 2013 - 2014, when the BRI was launched,\" Figueroa said. There is \"an obvious reassessment going on in the direction of safer investments and reducing China's risks overall,\" he added.\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Article\nUN General Assembly calls for 'unconditional' Gaza ceasefire\nPentagon chief urges 'close consultation' between Israel and US on Syria\nIndonesia must regain credibility as an honest broker\nTrump\u2019s second term could deepen Indonesia-China relations\nIndonesia urges citizens to exercise caution during transition of power in Syria\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nMore in World\nView more\nEurope\nUS announces new arms aid package for Ukraine worth $500 million\nMiddle East and Africa\nUS says Israel is acting in Syria for its own defence\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia welcomes UNGA resolution on immediate ceasefire in Gaza\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo\u2019s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nEntertainment\n'Astro Bot' wins highest award at Oscars of video games\nPolitics\nIndonesia to pardon tens of thousands including Papua activists\nAcademia\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?",

(AFP/Tang Chhin Sothy)\nB\narely 10 days before the ASEAN and Related Summits in Vientiane, on Oct. 9-11, China agreed to unleash a stimulus package of US$1.3 trillion.\nAlmost instantly, the Hong Kong Stock Exchange began to experience the fastest bull run the stock market has ever seen, compelling traders in Hong Kong, Shenzhen and Shanghai to cancel their week-long vacation that was starting on Oct. 1.\nThe leaders of Australia, Canada, the European Union, the United States and the United Kingdom, all of whom had flown into ASEAN to meet with various leaders, especially Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim who will lead ASEAN all through 2025, could not have been unimpressed with China's impeccable timing.\nTo be sure, the Nomura Research Center in Japan warned that a huge stimulus that is too big and too fast can potentially trigger a bubble. The fact is China prompted all the countries that were concerned with the developments in the South China Sea to take a more nuanced approach toward Beijing too.\nWhile the Philippines was adamant that China's maritime behavior must change, Vietnam was surreptitiously quiet. In turn, China did not trouble the waters openly in ASEAN.\nThis despite Vietnam's attempt to enlarge several features in the Paracel Islands based on reclaimed land that China had originally pioneered. If anything, China and ASEAN all concurred with Anwar's assertion that all sensitive issues should be discussed bilaterally, if need be, multilaterally, but more than anything else, behind closed doors.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nPerhaps issues such as the Rohingya and southern Thailand need to be addressed in the same manner to make them practical for resolution.\nWhile Anwar promised that Malaysia's chairmanship of ASEAN would focus on resilience and sustainability, a theme that has been around since 2019 when Thailand was then the chair, Anwar could not have ignored the importance of 2026 too.\nThe latter will be the year when the Philippines is the chair of ASEAN; followed by Singapore in 2027. For Anwar 2026 and 2027 are important as he has the option to call the 16th general election in Malaysia to get a second tenure of another five years in office, having become the 10th prime minister of Malaysia on Nov. 24, 2022.\nIndeed, Anwar told MNBC two weeks prior to the summit that in order to be a \"statesman, one cannot ignore the importance of being a politician.\"\nAnwar was being candid. Politicians, especially a Muslim democrat, must know how to win elections; notwithstanding the fact that Anwar has a two-thirds electoral majority based on the support that has been pledged to the coalition government.\nWhat makes Anwar confident that he can ensure a strong and resilient ASEAN that extends not merely from the security of the member states' supply chain but can handle the tensions that emanate from the Taiwan Strait, the East China Sea and finally the South China Sea?\nA good way to understand the statecraft of Anwar is his deep belief in alliance building, sometimes even reaching out to countries that are deemed to be opposed by the Group of Seven and EU such as China, Russia and Iran; of which the last three can be plainly described as a triple axis.\nThis is where Anwar's strategic and economic statecraft is based on alliance building and a loose amalgamation with the axis of China, Russia and Iran has to be broken down into six levels of analysis.\nFirst and foremost, Malaysia under Anwar practices a dynamic yet quiescent diplomacy. Reliable sources have confirmed that Anwar did not try to build strong bridges with the US during the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Summit in November 2023 in San Francisco.\nIn California, Anwar was even willing to drop all mention of the war in Israel, hoping that this could reduce the tensions between Hamas, the Houthis and Hezbollah and Israel. If one were to examine the speech of Anwar at APEC, he did condemn violence from all sides in the Middle East.\nThis was not merely an overture to Washington, to which Anwar admits \"cumulatively the US remains the largest trading partner of Malaysia\u201d, and by extension ASEAN. The US has been in Southeast Asia for a long time since its first annexation of the Philippines in 1898.\nBut it is not necessarily Malaysia that wants the foreign direct investment (FDI) of the US. The whole of ASEAN wants it to complement its FDI from China, the EU and UK too.\nTo the degree, more relationships need to be built with the triple axis of China, Russia and Iran, of which Iran is increasingly a pivotal power that can decide the geopolitical stability of the world, Anwar has agreed to guide ASEAN beyond its old allies to reach out to BRICS too.\nSecondly, Anwar has also emphasized the importance of the ASEAN-Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) Plus China initiative. In October last year ASEAN already had one inaugural summit in Riyadh.\nGranted the existence of Malaysia's Look East Policy that includes China, Japan and South Korea. The latter became the comprehensive strategic partner of ASEAN in Laos, leaving Japan as the lone polity out for now.\nVery soon Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, if he leads the Liberal Democratic Party to another electoral victory in November, will want to join the ASEAN-GCC Summit.\nThird, Anwar did not leave out the importance of the EU. If anything, Anwar emphasized the criticality of ASEAN and the EU enhancing their mutual trade.\nThis would be music to the ear of Prime Minister Lawrence Wong of Singapore, whom Anwar will meet again in early December to consolidate the Johor-Singapore Economic and Financial Zone. Why would Singapore be pleased with Anwar? For the longest time since the mid-1990s, Singapore has always supported, even convened the first, Europe and ASEAN Meeting (ASEM).\nFourth, Anwar has called for the admission of Timor-Leste into ASEAN by 2025. As and when, Timor-Leste succeeds, after more than two decades of waiting as a mere observer, ASEAN will extend its reach into the South Pacific Forum (SPF), which gathers 16 Micronesian states.\nThe Indo-Pacific rivalry that is so important to the Quad (Australia, US, India and Japan) cannot expand its influence into the South Pacific without first consulting ASEAN, since Timor-Leste would be a key member of Southeast Asia.\nThe \"convening power\" of ASEAN, all of which adds up to the centrality of Southeast Asia to the great powers, will be enhanced by Anwar with the tacit and open endorsement of all countries.\nIn sum, all geopolitical strategies could come to naught if Malaysia, for that matter ASEAN, does not know how to tackle economic issues jointly.\nBut beyond the quadruple alliance cum axis strategy to allow ASEAN to engage with the Global South and Global North, Anwar has explained the necessity of enhancing the intra-regional trade of ASEAN. This is to go beyond the 25 percent threshold currently in place to attain a regional self-sufficiency to be the fourth-largest economy in the world by 2030.\nThis could potentially still see Anwar and Wong and soon-to-be-inaugurated president-elect\nPrabowo Subianto\nof Indonesia all remaining in office.\nWith Malaysia focused on digitalization, renewable energy and manufacturing as some of the key planks of its growth strategy, all of which are shared by other members of ASEAN, Anwar is not short of the strategic depth to be the major statesman of Southeast Asia in the first half of the 21st century.\n***\nThe writer is CEO of Strategic Pan-Indo Pacific Arena\n.\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Article\nFrench troubles won't undermine Europe\u2019s strong foundation\nTrump\u2019s second term could deepen Indonesia-China relations\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources\nConsumers upbeat on RI economy in November, but spending boost unlikely\nPutin\u2019s India visit aims to shape global multipolarity\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nMore in Opinion\nView more\nAcademia\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo\u2019s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nEntertainment\n'Astro Bot' wins highest award at Oscars of video games\nPolitics\nIndonesia to pardon tens of thousands including Papua activists\nAcademia\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?",

(Antara/Fikri Yusuf)\nA\nfter concluding the Indonesia-Africa Forum 2024 with billions in cooperation pledges, Indonesia needs to figure out if it is serious about pivoting its foreign policy, what the benefits of this move would be and to what extent Indonesia is in a better position to make the pivot compared to other contenders.\nThese details are not only important to African countries, but also to Indonesia\u2019s neighbors, other regions of the world and even the great powers \u2014 the United States and China. As such, I argue that Indonesia must stop treating forums as its key diplomatic performance indicators and instead craft a tailored grand strategy for the region.\nA focus on convening meetings has always been in Indonesia\u2019s diplomatic records. From the 1955 Asian African Conference to the 2024 Indonesia-Africa Forum, the country ostensibly believes that meetings can achieve two goals in one strike: generating concrete economic benefits and exercising leadership on the global stage.\nThrough a forum, Indonesia\u2019s meetings, incentives, conferences and exhibitions (MICE) sector can generate revenue from the visiting delegates and some of them may buy handmade souvenirs from the country\u2019s small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Through a forum, Indonesian leaders can shake hands with their counterparts from diverse African countries, taking photos that are then used as a measurement of progress.\nWhile this pragmatic paradigm is not unique to Indonesia, the country can absolutely do better considering its position as a growing economic powerhouse.\nFor starters, the seriousness of Indonesia\u2019s Africa pivot cannot be justified only by organizing a forum.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nAdequate resources and public awareness are crucial. Unfortunately, African countries are yet to enjoy these privileges from Indonesia.

(AFP/Adek Berry)\nT\nhe Third Plenary Session of the 20th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC), held in Beijing from July 15 to 18, marked a significant moment in China\u2019s political and economic landscape.\nThe communiqu\u00e9 issued at the conclusion of this session reaffirms the CPC's commitment to the ideological framework of President Xi Jinping and underscores a comprehensive strategy for China's modernization through deepened reforms. This strategy includes ambitious goals for economic development, governance and national security, reflecting China's commitment to becoming a leading global power.\nCentral to the session's outcomes is the reaffirmation of \u201cXi Jinping Thoughts on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era\u201d. This ideological cornerstone is presented as the guiding light for China's path forward, emphasizing Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, Deng Xiaoping Theory, the Theory of Three Represents and the Scientific Outlook on Development.\nThe synthesis of these doctrines into a cohesive framework illustrates an attempt to root modern policies in historical continuity, providing stability amid significant policy shifts. This ideological commitment aims to consolidate power within the CPC and reinforce Xi\u2019s position at the helm, ensuring alignment with the party\u2019s long-term vision.\nThe communiqu\u00e9 outlines a robust agenda for deepening reforms further to advance Chinese modernization. Key areas include building a high-standard socialist market economy, promoting high-quality economic development, advancing whole-process people's democracy and modernizing China\u2019s governance and national security systems. These goals are ambitious and aim to position China as a leading global power by mid-century.\nThe emphasis on \"promoting high-quality development\" and \"deepening supply-side structural reform\" acknowledges the need for economic recalibration. Shifting toward a more consumption-driven, innovation-based economy is necessary but challenging, requiring profound changes in industrial policy, financial regulation and labor markets.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nThe terms \"whole-process people's democracy\" and \"socialist rule of law\" reflect China's efforts to enhance governance efficiency and legitimacy, contributing to the country's overall stability and progress.\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Article\nTrump\u2019s second term could deepen Indonesia-China relations\nBali airport initiator signs HoA with Chinese company\nA new journey in China-Indonesia relationship: Building a shared future\nIDX Composite closes higher at 7,504.13 on Monday\nA Faustian bargain?

(AFP/Kenzaburo Fukuhara)\nB\ny hosting Xi Jinping on the last leg of the Chinese leader's European tour, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban will get a chance to tighten bonds between Beijing and its closest ally in the EU.\nXi began his trip earlier this week in France, a visit that was cordial but also highlighted tensions between Beijing and the EU over the war in Ukraine and global trade.\nAfter visiting Serbia, a non-EU partner, Xi will arrive in Budapest on Wednesday evening to cap his first European trip since 2019.\nXi can expect a warm welcome when he holds talks with Orban, who has bucked the European Union's official position to \"derisk\" relations with China.\n\"It is clearly a visit of historic significance,\" said Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto, noting that it was the first visit by a Chinese president in 20 years.\nOrban has been championing an \"Eastern opening\" foreign policy since his return to power in 2010, seeking closer economic ties to China, Russia and other Asian countries.\nThe nationalist premier remained committed to his strategy even as tensions between Western nations and Beijing increased over human rights violations, the Covid pandemic, trade and Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\nIn recent years, the Central European country of 9.6 million people has attracted a flood of major Chinese projects, mostly related to battery and electric vehicle (EV) manufacturing.\nHungary has become \"more valuable for Beijing both economically and politically\", said Tamas Matura, an associate professor at Corvinus University.\nIt is the EU's \"last explicitly and openly pro-China government\", Matura added.\nLooking to the East&nbsp;\nLast October, Orban was the sole EU leader to attend a summit for Xi's flagship Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) in Beijing.\nDuring the conference, Orban said Hungary was one of the \"proponents of connectivity, (who) reject the policy which promotes blocs\" amid \"talk of decoupling and derisking\".&nbsp;\n\"The relationship with Hungary is stable and reliable,\" Yan Xuetong, director of the Institute of International Studies at Tsinghua University, told AFP during a visit to Budapest.\n\"Chinese companies feel safe investing in the country, expecting their business won't be disturbed by unpleasant political developments,\" he added.\nSince Hungary began to promote itself as a global hub for EV manufacturing in 2022, several new Chinese businesses have sprung up all over the country.\nBattery manufacturer CATL is building its second European factory near the eastern city of Debrecen, while Chinese carmaker BYD is due to manufacture passenger cars in southern Szeged as early as next year.\nAccording to the Hungarian government, around 15 billion euros' worth of ongoing projects originate from the Asian country.\nIn return, Chinese companies benefit from tax breaks, a favourable regulatory environment and generous infrastructure subsidies.\nRaising concerns&nbsp;\nIn 2015, Hungary became the first European country to join the BRI, a controversial project to revive the Silk Road through global transport networks and infrastructure funded via Chinese loans.\nA high-speed railway project to connect Budapest and Belgrade is behind schedule.\nBilateral cooperation has flourished in other areas, with Budapest purchasing Chinese vaccines during the pandemic and promising to host the first Chinese university campus in the EU.\nIt recently also signed a security pact authorising Chinese police officers to patrol in Hungary alongside local authorities.\nWhile the government says Hungary is benefiting from its partnership with China, opposition parties have raised concerns over a lack of transparency, the environmental impact of battery factories and corruption.\n\"We are giving huge discounts for these projects, which place a huge financial burden on taxpayers... but only Orban's inner circle is getting richer,\" said Sandor Ronai of the left-wing Democratic Coalition.\nMoreover, China has repeatedly relied on Budapest \"to block or significantly water down some EU decisions, which were concerning to them\", said expert Matej Simalcik.\n\"The same logic could also apply to decision-making within NATO,\" he told AFP.\nA NATO member since 1999, Hungary has set itself apart from other allies by calling for an immediate ceasefire in the Ukraine war and denouncing what it called \"war fever\".\nSzijjarto, Hungary's foreign minister, said both countries are in \"absolute agreement\" over their approach to bring \"peace\" to the conflict.\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians

China\u2019s economy grew by 4.5 percent year-on-year in the first quarter of 2023, according to official data.\n(AFP/Getty Images)\nA\ns China charts its course for 2024, the palpable resonance from Beijing is a resounding commitment to prioritize high-quality development. The recently concluded Central Economic Work Conference (CEWC), the most important policy-making event for 2024 and beyond, underscored the centrality of economic growth and high-quality development in China's political agenda.\nThe conference has delineated the economic policy for the upcoming year, emphasizing comprehensive reform, heightened openness, and the consolidation of foreign trade and investment foundations. The directive underscores the imperative of constructing a modern industrial system propelled by scientific and technological innovations. Additionally, it stresses the resilience of industry and supply chains.\nAnalysts interpret the expression as a manifestation of policymakers' confidence and determination to stabilize economic growth while advancing high-quality development through novel growth drivers. The focal points include scientific and technological innovation, endogenous driving forces, effective macro policies, and demand expansion efficiency.\nAgainst the backdrop of heightened uncertainties and formidable geopolitical challenges, the leadership in Beijing has affirmed its commitment to fostering a robust and stable economic landscape. The proclamation emanating from the conference is a reflection of China's focus on growth, echoing the sentiment that economic prosperity stands as the linchpin of its political priorities. A strategic orchestration of pro-growth policies takes center stage, signaling a deliberate effort to manage the complex terrain of contemporary geopolitics.\nImportantly, this dedication goes beyond conventional economic spheres, stretching into non-economic domains as well. The comprehensive coordination, encompassing diverse sectors, reflects a holistic approach aimed at fortifying the nation's economic foundations. In the face of unpredictable global dynamics, China's emphasis on stability has emerged as a strategic imperative, aligning its economic policies to withstand headwinds.\nThe pledge to enhance coordination, both within economic spheres and across non-economic sectors, illustrates a pragmatic strategy. This multifaceted approach seeks not only to bolster economic indicators but also to cultivate an environment conducive to sustained stability. The tone-setting conference acknowledged the commendable recovery and high-quality development achieved by China's economy in 2023.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nWhile recognizing this progress, it also candidly addressed the existing challenges that demand attention for further economic revitalization. The outlined obstacles include insufficient effective demand, sectors grappling with overcapacity, and subdued social expectations.\nEmphasizing a pragmatic approach, the conference stressed the prevalence of favorable conditions outweighing unfavorable factors in China's developmental landscape. Looking ahead to the economic agenda for the upcoming year, the conference articulated a strategic vision. It called for a balanced pursuit of progress and stability, advocating for the consolidation of stability through continuous progress.\nThis year's CEWC focused on a paramount political task: advancing Chinese modernization. Emphasizing the significance of economic construction and the primary goal of achieving high-quality development, the conference articulated a grand blueprint for transforming Chinese modernization into a tangible reality.\nTo expedite the generation of fresh momentum for foreign trade, solidify the foundational structure of both foreign trade and investment and broaden the scope of intermediate cross-border e-commerce, the conference emphasized the continuous establishment of a market-oriented and globally attuned business environment. It accentuated the importance of removing impediments to foreign engagement in China, spanning business, education and tourism.\nThe comprehensive implementation of eight measures supporting high-quality Belt and Road cooperation was also stressed. China's recent policy initiatives, both preceding and following the CEWC, reflect its commitment to not only bolstering its open economy but also elevating the quality of this openness.\nKey measures include the strategic enhancement of institutional openness within the China (Shanghai) Pilot Free Trade Zone, aligning it more closely with international economic and trade norms. The pivotal 24th China-EU Summit and the protocol to enhance the China-Singapore Free Trade Agreement exemplify China's proactive engagement in global economic affairs.\nAdditionally, the implementation of a visa-free policy for select nationals, contingent on specific conditions, reinforces China's intention to nurture international collaboration and facilitate cross-border interactions. These concerted efforts reflect China's strategic intent for a more interconnected and dynamic global economic landscape.\nAt the same time, the CEWC has emphasized the imperative of addressing and mitigating risks in crucial sectors, such as real estate, local government debt and small- to medium-sized financial institutions. Concerning the real estate industry, the meeting prioritized the equitable fulfillment of the reasonable financing needs of real estate enterprises of varying ownership structures, coupled with an expeditious implementation of a new development model.\nDespite sensationalized portrayals by some Western media outlets, analysts contend that the meeting's communication reflected the confidence and adeptness of top officials in managing these challenges and ensuring a steady economic recovery. The clarity in identifying these challenges and the proactive strategies employed instill confidence that China is well-equipped to overcome these obstacles and secure a resilient and stable economic trajectory.\nChina's economic agenda, as articulated in the final readout of the CEWC, accentuates the pivotal role of expanding domestic demand, ranking second in its hierarchy of focus. The emphasis lies on cultivating a reciprocal relationship between consumption and investment, creating a virtuous cycle.\nThe noteworthy addition is the concept of \"consumption with potentials\", encompassing sectors experiencing burgeoning demand like healthcare, elderly care and the digital economy. China's economic strategy takes a nuanced turn by prioritizing the expansion of domestic demand and stimulating untapped consumption potential.\nThe meeting emphasized a seamless transition from post-pandemic recovery to sustained expansion, urging the cultivation of new consumption patterns. Digital, green and health-focused consumption are focal points, coupled with the active development of emerging consumption sectors like smart homes, entertainment, tourism, sports events, and innovative Chinese products.\nThis recalibration aligns with evolving global trends and positions China at the forefront of cultivating diverse and forward-looking consumer behaviors, contributing to the resilience and adaptability of its economic landscape.\nSimultaneously, the call for productive investment aligns with the intention to develop new avenues for consumption growth. This strategic shift recognizes the escalating significance of consumption, contributing 83.2 percent to China's economic growth in the initial three quarters.\nFurthermore, the evolution of China's foreign trade dynamics is conspicuous, with solar batteries, lithium-ion batteries, and electric vehicles eclipsing traditional drivers like apparel and furniture. The robust 41.7 percent year-on-year surge in the export value of these tech-intensive green products during the first three quarters explains China's adaptability and prowess in shaping contemporary global trade.\nChina has consistently defied Western speculations of collapse through practical achievements. The core of China's success lies in its unwavering adherence to high-quality development. This single-minded commitment positions China as a powerhouse focused on progress and prosperity.\n&nbsp;***\nThe writer is a freelance columnist on international affairs based in Karachi.\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Article\nNavigating Indonesia-US relations amid global and domestic changes\nFrench troubles won't undermine Europe\u2019s strong foundation\nXi says trade war with US will have 'no winners'\nForeign Minister Sugiono lists priorities in debut meeting with lawmakers\n12% VAT: A Fiscal solution or an economic burden on the middle class?\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nMore in Opinion\nView more\nAcademia\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo\u2019s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia to evacuate more citizens from Syria\nEntertainment\n'Astro Bot' wins highest award at Oscars of video games\nPolitics\nIndonesia to pardon tens of thousands including Papua activists\nAcademia\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election",

(JP/Deni Ghifari)\nI\nn November, President\nPrabowo Subianto\nvisited China, the United States, Peru, Brazil, the United Kingdom and United Arab Emirates (UAE)&nbsp;to strengthen bilateral and multilateral ties, highlighting Indonesia's growing influence in Asia and the Americas.\nAs 2025 approaches, the global landscape remains multipolar, with rising US-China&nbsp;tensions. Following the Non-Aligned Movement, Indonesia pursues an independent foreign policy prioritizing its national interests. Its strategic position along key maritime trade routes enhances its role in regional stability and global commerce.\nWhile China aims to reduce competitors' influence, Indonesia leverages its relationship with China to negotiate with the US and other advanced economies. However, Indonesia must carefully engage with China to protect its security and sovereignty. President Prabowo has reiterated his commitment to cooperation with China, but this evolving dynamic has overshadowed US diplomatic efforts. For a more effective approach, the US should reassess its policies toward Indonesia and focus on building strong economic partnerships.\nIn recent years, Indonesia has fundamentally redefined its maritime strategy,&nbsp;particularly under former president Joko \u201cJokowi\u201d Widodo\u2019s administration, enhancing its role in the Indo-Pacific with a strategic naval policy. This evolution positions Indonesia as a vital player in regional security and governance.\nAs the US and Indonesia celebrate 75 years of diplomatic ties, their relationship has evolved into a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership (CSP), reinforcing cooperation in addressing global challenges. This partnership is crucial for stability and prosperity, aligning with Indonesia's strategic goals through initiatives like the Indo-Pacific&nbsp;Economic Framework (IPEF). Together, they aim to strengthen maritime security and foster sustainable economic development, paving the way for a resilient future for the region.\nOn Nov. 12, during a formal meeting in Washington, DC, US President Joe Biden and President Prabowo&nbsp;discussed strategic initiatives to build a strong and lasting partnership. They emphasized the critical need to strengthen bilateral defense collaboration to improve regional and global security. A major focus of their discussions was enhancing advanced maritime security capabilities and coordinating operations to combat illegal transnational organized crime.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nThey also placed emphasis on developing integrated intelligence-sharing protocols and creating joint operational frameworks to effectively address emerging security challenges.\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Article\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?\nStop with the LGBTQ scapegoating\nRussia teams up with BRICS to create AI alliance\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nMore in Opinion\nView more\nAcademia\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo\u2019s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia to evacuate more citizens from Syria\nEntertainment\n'Astro Bot' wins highest award at Oscars of video games\nPolitics\nIndonesia to pardon tens of thousands including Papua activists\nAcademia\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election",

(AFP/Alexander Nemenov)\nP\nresident Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday that Russia would develop artificial intelligence with BRICS partners and other countries,&nbsp;in&nbsp;a bid to challenge the dominance of the United States in one of the most promising and crucial technologies of the 21st century.\nSpeaking at Russia's flagship AI conference, Putin said the new AI Alliance Network would include national associations and development institutions in the field of AI from BRICS countries and other interested states.&nbsp;\n\"Russia must participate on equal terms in the global race to create strong artificial intelligence. It is precisely the advanced solutions that Russian scientists are currently working on,\" Putin told an AI conference in Moscow.&nbsp;\n\"We invite scientists from all over the world to join in the collaboration,\" he added.\nWestern sanctions intended to restrict Russia's access to the technologies it needs to sustain its war against Ukraine have resulted in the world's major producers of microchips halting exports to Russia, sorely limiting its AI ambitions.\nRussia's dominant lender Sberbank is spearheading AI development in Russia, but&nbsp;Sberbank CEO German Gref acknowledged in 2023 that graphics processing units (GPUs), the microchips that underpin AI development, were the trickiest hardware for Russia to replace.&nbsp;\nOn Wednesday, the bank said national AI associations from BRICS members Brazil, China, India and South Africa, but also from Serbia,&nbsp;Indonesia&nbsp;and other non-BRICS countries, had joined the AI Alliance Network.\nIt said the network would facilitate joint research into technology and AI regulation, and&nbsp;provide opportunities for AI products&nbsp;to be sold in&nbsp;member countries' markets.\nThe United States and China are the world's top AI powers, and US President-elect Donald Trump has named a \"White House AI and Crypto Czar\" to help ensure the United States remains the richest and most technologically advanced power in the world.\nBut Putin's move to ally with China could change the dynamics of the AI race.\nRussia is one of 10 countries, including the US, China, Britain and Israel, that are developing their own generative AI models. The Yakov and Partners consultancy, run by former McKinsey employees in Moscow, says this gives it the potential to become a much more significant player.\nRussia sees the use of AI technologies across all sectors adding 11.2 trillion roubles ($109 billion) to gross domestic product in 2030, compared to 0.2 trillion roubles ($1.9 billion) in 2023.&nbsp;\nIts AI strategy also says that 80 percent of all Russian workers should have AI skills by 2030, compared with 5 percent in 2023, while AI investment should grow seven-fold to 850 billion roubles.&nbsp;\nSberbank, which has developed a generative AI model called GigaChat, and technology leader Yandex, with its YandexGPT model, dominate Russia's domestic AI market.&nbsp;\nRussia currently ranks 31st of 83 countries by AI implementation, innovation and investment on UK-based Tortoise Media's Global AI Index, well behind not only the United States and China but also fellow BRICS members India and Brazil.&nbsp;\nStanford University's AI vibrancy tool, which evaluates 36 countries based on 42 AI indicators including research and development, ranks Russia 29th.\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Article\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nChina\u2019s fast-changing economic adjustments\nChinese guards on the ground in Myanmar could go disastrously wrong\nTrump's unorthodox cabinet picks test party loyalty\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nMore in World\nView more\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia to evacuate more citizens from Syria\nEurope\nUS announces new arms aid package for Ukraine worth $500 million\nMiddle East and Africa\nUS says Israel is acting in Syria for its own defence\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo\u2019s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia to evacuate more citizens from Syria\nEntertainment\n'Astro Bot' wins highest award at Oscars of video games\nPolitics\nIndonesia to pardon tens of thousands including Papua activists\nAcademia\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election",

(Courtesy of Xinhua/-)\nP\nresident\nPrabowo Subianto\nand President Xi Jinping witnessed last month the signing ceremony of a consensus document on the joint development of fisheries, oil and gas in maritime areas where the two countries have overlapping claims, signed by foreign ministers Sugiono and Wang Yi. The ceremony was not announced, and nobody in foreign policy communities, academics or bureaucrats knows the content of this document.\nWhat is happening? Then came a bombardment of questions.\nIs Indonesia\u2019s foreign policy stance and outlook on overlapping claims in the South China Sea changing? Perhaps. Does Indonesia acknowledge China\u2019s claim in the South China Sea according to its nine-dash line? No. Do Indonesia and China agree that there are overlapping claims between the two sides? Yes.\nWho is driving the changes related to overlapping claims between the two countries? China. This started when Indonesia and China released a joint statement after their bilateral summit. Based on the wording and earlier draft documents obtained, it is clear that the Chinese side drafted the joint statement and other bilateral documents.\nThe Indonesian side immediately issued a press statement saying the essential common understanding of joint development in areas of overlapping claims cannot be interpreted as an acknowledgment of China\u2019s claims in the nine-dash line. It also said Indonesia\u2019s position so far was that this claim had no basis in international law and did not follow the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) of 1982. This cooperation therefore had no impact on Indonesia's sovereignty, sovereign rights, or jurisdiction in the North Natuna Sea.\nStill, the international community needs clarification about whether Indonesia is still an honest broker without overlapping claims in the nine-dash line, which became valid after the bilateral meeting between Prabowo and Xi.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nThe joint statement, the first between Indonesia and China related to specific overlapping claims, has caused tumult among not only academics at home and the Jakarta bureaucracy, but also diplomats in the region and around the globe.\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Article\nStop with the LGBTQ scapegoating\nFrench troubles won't undermine Europe\u2019s strong foundation\nProtecting our archipelago from illegal fishing\nTrump\u2019s second term could deepen Indonesia-China relations\nMission to Syria\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nMore in Opinion\nView more\nAcademia\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo\u2019s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia to evacuate more citizens from Syria\nEntertainment\n'Astro Bot' wins highest award at Oscars of video games\nPolitics\nIndonesia to pardon tens of thousands including Papua activists\nAcademia\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election",

(Antara/Aji Styawan)\nA\nt a recent annual meeting in Asunci\u00f3n, Paraguay, 63 new practices and traditions were inscribed on UNESCO\u2019s List of Intangible Cultural Heritage (ICH) at the initiative of 90 countries, including the successful inscription of three Indonesian elements: kebaya, kolintang and Reog Ponorogo.\nKebaya\nand\nkolintang\nwere added to the Representative List of ICH, and Reog Ponorogo to the List of ICH in Need of Urgent Safeguarding.\nKebaya\nis a traditional blouse worn by women,\nkolintang\nis a traditional wooden musical instrument of the indigenous Minahasa people of North Sulawesi, and Reog Ponorogo is a performing art from Ponorogo, East Java.\nIt\u2019s worth noting that of the three,\nkebaya\nand\nkolintang\nwere inscribed through a multinational or joint nomination, which applies when a cultural element exists in more than one country.\nKebaya\nis listed as a heritage shared among the five Southeast Asian countries of Brunei Darussalam, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand, while\nkolintang\nis registered as a cultural practice and expression that has links to the balafon in Mali, Burkina Faso and C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire.\nPreviously, the notion of a joint nomination had caused some misunderstandings among the Indonesian public, although it was not the first such case. In 2020,\npantun\n(four-line rhyming poetry) was inscribed as an ICH from both Indonesia and Malaysia. In 2019,\npencak silat\nwas designated jointly as a traditional sport from Indonesia and a combative art of self-defense from Malaysia.\nPrior to the inscription of\nkebaya\n, Indonesian media outlets were full of news about protests against a possible joint nomination.

(Reuters/Brian Snyder )\nW\nith Donald Trump having been elected the 47\nth\npresident of the United States, his presidency will likely lead to shifts in Southeast Asia\u2019s geoeconomic landscape. His \u201cAmerica First\u201d policy suggests an era of heightened trade wars, a potential unraveling of multilateral agreements and a retraction of US commitments to and engagement with Southeast Asia.\nFor Southeast Asia, where many nations walk a tightrope between Washington and Beijing, Trump\u2019s combative approach toward China will require them to recalibrate their policy.&nbsp;Economically, meanwhile, as the US-China rivalry intensifies, Southeast Asian nations might attract foreign direct investment as companies seek alternatives to China. Yet this dynamic could also deepen the region\u2019s reliance on China for trade and investment, as Trump\u2019s tariffs may force regional players such as Indonesia to lean closer to Beijing for economic support and infrastructure funding.\nFor Indonesia, the Trump presidency will present the challenge of balancing economic opportunities with the US and China without being drawn too far into the orbit of either. Trump\u2019s isolationist approach, particularly his plans to impose high tariffs, means that trade relations with the US are likely to become more complex.\nSoutheast Asia, with its export-oriented economies, is wary of Trump\u2019s promise to introduce 10 to 20 percent blanket tariffs on imports and a staggering 60 percent on goods from China, with a specific 200 percent on Chinese electric vehicles. These moves could potentially push Indonesia to deepen its economic reliance on China.\nIndonesia\u2019s primary economic goal under Prabowo, downstream industrialization, aligns well with China\u2019s investment priorities. In recent years, Chinese companies have invested significantly in Indonesia\u2019s nickel and EV battery industries, both essential to Indonesia\u2019s plans to position itself as a major player in the global EV supply chain. With the world\u2019s largest reserves of nickel, Indonesia has made a strategic bet on its future as a provider of key battery components. However, Trump\u2019s plan to roll back US support for the EV industry, including plans to cut incentives that have driven domestic EV demand, could have negative effects on global demand for EV batteries and, in turn, for Indonesian nickel.\nAnother issue where Trump\u2019s policies could impact Indonesia is the climate agenda. Indonesia, like other Southeast Asian nations, is undergoing an economic transformation toward the use of cleaner energy sources. This shift is partly supported by international initiatives like the Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP). This partnership, heavily funded by the United States and other developed nations, is crucial for supporting Indonesia\u2019s transition from coal dependency to renewable energy.&nbsp;If Trump withdraws US support from the JETP and other climate funds, Indonesia may find itself with fewer resources to fuel its green transition. China, with its own renewable energy advancements and investments in Asia, may emerge as an alternative source of green funding for Indonesia.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nFurthermore, economic engagement has been a key pillar of the US Indo-Pacific strategy under Joe Biden. This would allow countries in the region to build economic ties with the US as a counterbalance to China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). However, Trump\u2019s return could mark a retreat from economic engagement, as he focuses on bilateral deals rather than multilateral trade frameworks. Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw the US from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) in his first term is likely to be mirrored in his second, during which the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF) and other economic initiatives could be abandoned entirely.\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Article\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nMinistry inks collab with army, police on food security\nMegawati supports free meals program, with caveat\nAgainst the tide: Defending human rights and civic freedoms in Southeast Asia\nTrump taps election denier to head global media operation VOA\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nMore in Opinion\nView more\nAcademia\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo\u2019s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia to evacuate more citizens from Syria\nEntertainment\n'Astro Bot' wins highest award at Oscars of video games\nPolitics\nIndonesia to pardon tens of thousands including Papua activists\nAcademia\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election",

(JP/Deni Ghifari)\nI\nn November, President\nPrabowo Subianto\nvisited China, the United States, Peru, Brazil, the United Kingdom and United Arab Emirates (UAE)&nbsp;to strengthen bilateral and multilateral ties, highlighting Indonesia's growing influence in Asia and the Americas.\nAs 2025 approaches, the global landscape remains multipolar, with rising US-China&nbsp;tensions. Following the Non-Aligned Movement, Indonesia pursues an independent foreign policy prioritizing its national interests. Its strategic position along key maritime trade routes enhances its role in regional stability and global commerce.\nWhile China aims to reduce competitors' influence, Indonesia leverages its relationship with China to negotiate with the US and other advanced economies. However, Indonesia must carefully engage with China to protect its security and sovereignty. President Prabowo has reiterated his commitment to cooperation with China, but this evolving dynamic has overshadowed US diplomatic efforts. For a more effective approach, the US should reassess its policies toward Indonesia and focus on building strong economic partnerships.\nIn recent years, Indonesia has fundamentally redefined its maritime strategy,&nbsp;particularly under former president Joko \u201cJokowi\u201d Widodo\u2019s administration, enhancing its role in the Indo-Pacific with a strategic naval policy. This evolution positions Indonesia as a vital player in regional security and governance.\nAs the US and Indonesia celebrate 75 years of diplomatic ties, their relationship has evolved into a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership (CSP), reinforcing cooperation in addressing global challenges. This partnership is crucial for stability and prosperity, aligning with Indonesia's strategic goals through initiatives like the Indo-Pacific&nbsp;Economic Framework (IPEF). Together, they aim to strengthen maritime security and foster sustainable economic development, paving the way for a resilient future for the region.\nOn Nov. 12, during a formal meeting in Washington, DC, US President Joe Biden and President Prabowo&nbsp;discussed strategic initiatives to build a strong and lasting partnership.

(Reuters/Dilara Senkaya)\nJ\nust over a year ago, China gave Bashar al-Assad and his wife a warm welcome during their six-day visit to the country, offering the former Syrian leader a rare break from years of international isolation since the start of a civil war in 2011.\nAs the couple attended the Asian Games, President Xi Jinping vowed to support Assad in \"opposing external interference\" and in Syria's rebuilding, while his wife Asma was feted in Chinese media.\nBut the abrupt end to the rule of the authoritarian leader so explicitly backed by Xi only last year has dealt a blow to China's diplomatic ambitions in the Middle East and exposed the limits of its strategy in the region, analysts say.\nA coalition of rebels seized Syria's capital Damascus on Sunday after a lightning offensive that toppled&nbsp;Assad's regime and ended his family's 50-year dynasty.\n\"There's been a lot of an exaggerated sense of China's ability to shape political outcomes in the region,\" said Jonathan Fulton, a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council.\nWhile the collapse of the Assad regime was seen reducing the influence in the Arab world of his main backers, Iran and Russia, it was also a blow for China's global ambitions, said Fulton.\n\"A lot of what (China has) been doing internationally has relied on support with those countries, and their inability to prop up their biggest partner in the Middle East says quite a lot about their ability to do much beyond the region.\"\nTackling Hotspots&nbsp;\nAfter China brokered a deal between long-time rivals Saudi Arabia and Iran in 2023, Chinese media praised Beijing's rising profile in a neighbourhood long dominated by Washington.&nbsp;\nWang Yi, China's top diplomat, said the country would play a constructive role in handling global \"hotspot issues\".\nChina also brokered a truce between Fatah, Hamas and other rival Palestinian factions earlier this year and has made repeated calls for a ceasefire in Gaza.\nBut despite bringing Middle Eastern leaders to Beijing and rounds of \"shuttle diplomacy\" by its Middle Eastern envoy, Zhai Jun, in the months since, Palestinians have not formed a unity government and the conflict in Gaza continues.\n\"Assad's sudden downfall is not a scenario Beijing wishes to see,\" said Fan Hongda, a Middle East scholar at Shanghai International Studies University. \"China prefers a more stable and independent Middle East, as chaos or a pro-American orientation in the region does not align with China's interests.\"&nbsp;\nThe response by China's foreign ministry to Assad's fall has been muted, focusing on the safety of Chinese nationals and calling for a \"political solution\" to restore stability in Syria as soon as possible.\nMinistry of foreign affairs spokesperson, Mao Ning, on Monday appeared to leave an opening for engagement with the future government: \"China's friendly relations with Syria are for all Syrian people,\" she said.\nChinese experts and diplomats say Beijing will now bide its time before recognising a new government in Damascus.&nbsp;\nIt could use its expertise and financial muscle to support reconstruction, they say, but its commitments are likely to be limited because China has sought to minimise financial risks overseas in recent years.\nSyria joined China's flagship Belt and Road Initiative in 2022, but there have been no significant investments by Chinese firms since, partly due to sanctions.&nbsp;\nChina is \"not really able to fundamentally replace the West either as an economic partner, or diplomatic or military force in the region,\" said Bill Figueroa, assistant professor at the University of Groningen and an expert in China-Middle East relations.\n\"China in 2024 has way less money than China in 2013 - 2014, when the BRI was launched,\" Figueroa said. There is \"an obvious reassessment going on in the direction of safer investments and reducing China's risks overall,\" he added.\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Article\nIndonesia to evacuate more citizens from Syria&nbsp;\nBiden pushes new Russia, Iran, Korea, China effort before Trump term\nIndonesia urges citizens to exercise caution during transition of power in Syria\nAssad is in Moscow after deal on military bases\nSyrians rejoice as Assad flees, ending brutal reign\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nMore in World\nView more\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia to evacuate more citizens from Syria\nEurope\nUS announces new arms aid package for Ukraine worth $500 million\nMiddle East and Africa\nUS says Israel is acting in Syria for its own defence\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo\u2019s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia to evacuate more citizens from Syria\nEntertainment\n'Astro Bot' wins highest award at Oscars of video games\nPolitics\nIndonesia to pardon tens of thousands including Papua activists\nAcademia\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election",

(AFP/Pool/Maxim Shipenkov)\nN\nearly three years after his last visit to India in December 2021, Russian President Vladimir Putin will be in New Delhi for the forthcoming reciprocal 23rd annual bilateral summit with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, pending the announcement of specific dates. Putin\u2019s visit will be at Modi\u2019s invitation, which was extended during their bilateral meeting on the sidelines of October\u2019s BRICS Summit in Kazan.\nThe two leaders had met earlier at the 22nd India-Russia summit, held on the sidelines of the Eastern Economic Forum in Russia in July. At that time, both sides reconfirmed their commitment to strengthen their \u201cspecial and privileged\u201d strategic partnership and its historical, time-tested and all-weather nature.\nThe upcoming summit is significant, as Putin\u2019s priority would be to advance multipolarity amid a rapidly changing global order from unipolar dominance to multipolar balance.\nThe declaration of the BRICS Summit in Kazan resembled a testament to building a fairer and more just world order, which will be represented by the voice of the Global South/global majority that remains marginalized in Western-centric international institutions.\nLike China, India is expected to be considered a civilizational state and an important partner in building a multipolar order in the emerging global balance of power led by Russia\u2019s initiative.\nRussian philosopher Alexander Dugin, whose ideas have much influence on the policies of Putin and Moscow, considers China, India and his country as civilizational states, rather than nation-states in the Westphalian model of international relations. For him, multipolarity should be based on dialogue among Russia, China and India as part of the Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa (BRICS) grouping that challenges Western dominance.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nDugin emphasizes the crucial role India can play in the new global order and balance of power, which includes liberation from a colonial mindset and keeping away from West-dominated narratives.\nThe discourse in academic and policy circles, especially in Russia and the Global South, questions Western dominance and the marginalization of non-Western voices and experiences. The debate calls for commitment to diversity, inclusiveness, pluralistic universalism and grounding in world history.\nBesides the NATO expansion to the East, political instability, the rebirth of fascism in Europe and the United States and confronting the new Cold War are the reasons for Russia\u2019s call to build a multipolar world order with the support of Turkey, Egypt, India, China, Brazil, South Africa and others, through Eurasian integration and strengthening multilateral platforms like BRICS, the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation and the Group of 20.\nBRICS is the most crucial institution in the new Cold War and for establishing a multipolar world order. The changing global context and cooperation with Russia in the Global South, especially under the BRICS framework, shows that isolating Russia is difficult.\nRussia is now committed to building a fairer and just multipolar world order as envisioned in the Kazan Declaration, which calls for strengthening multilateralism, enhancing economic cooperation, strengthening people-to-people exchanges, respecting the United Nations Charter and international law, fighting terrorism and climate change, among others.\nA consensus was sought about viewing \u201cunlawful unilateral coercive measures\u201d, such as sanctions, as detrimental to the global economy and Sustainable Development Goals. Therefore, the expanded BRICS agreed to de-dollarize and trade in national currencies.\nPutin sees the current significance of Russia, India and China in the East to confront Containment II, the US' post-Cold War containment policy, in the 21st century, in the same way Lenin observed in 1923 the significance of Russia\u2019s alliance with India and China for ensuring the success of socialism in its struggle against imperialist countries.\nIn the context of the emergence of a multipolar world, former US secretary of state Henry Kissinger said: \u201cIndia will be a fulcrum of 21st-century order: an indispensable element...\u201d\nPutin views that Russia, China and India\u2019s alliance might counter NATO expansion and neoliberal capitalism, strengthen multipolarity and ensure the emergence of a multipolar world order that is more democratic, equitable, prosperous and peaceful.\nIn a recent speech at Valdai International Discussion Club\u2019s plenary meeting in Sochi, Putin said, \u201cIndia should be included in the list of great powers,\u201d considering its fast technological and economic growth.\nThere is speculation that Putin may have played a role in bringing together Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping for a successful meeting at Kazan, where they agreed to keep the overall relationship cooperative, contribute to regional and global peace and act with a long-term view to advancing multipolarity.\nImportantly, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi asserted that Beijing and New Delhi were nonaligned, upheld multilateralism and would contribute to the process of building global multipolarity.\nIndian foreign minister S. Jaishankar, who met Wang on the sidelines of the recent G20 summit in Rio de Janeiro, said the two sides agreed to work together toward rebuilding trust and mutual understanding. Progress would be expected in resuming direct flights, exchanging journalists and facilitating visa issuance.\nAt the 22nd India-Russia summit, Putin and Modi reaffirmed their commitment to the countries\u2019 \u201cspecial and privileged strategic partnership\u201d.\nIndia also adopted a neutral position in the Ukraine-Russia war, urging the latter to resolve the conflict through dialogue and diplomacy in accordance with international law. After the outbreak of war in Ukraine, India-Russia trade expanded considerably.\nIndia is one of the main importers of Russian oil despite pressure from US-Western partners. The target is to increase the trade volume from US$65 billion in 2023 to $100 billion by 2030.\nNext year\u2019s 23rd India-Russia summit will reflect upon and review the partnership, discuss future directions and trajectories and a road map for cooperation toward building global multipolarity. Defense cooperation is the major focus of Russia\u2019s strategic partnership, though trade and economic cooperation is expanding.\nThe writer is an associate professor at Jawaharlal Nehru University\u2019s Centre for Russian and Central Asian Studies.

Since the start of the year, the index has lost 1.06 percent.\nThe positive sentiment in Tuesday's market was mainly driven by external sentiment.

(JP/Arief Suhardiman)\nD\nonald J. Trump\u2019s reelection as the United States president serves as a reminder that we cannot take the international order for granted. While we respect the choice of the American people, we are all too familiar with the world under his prior administration.\nDuring his first term, the US adopted a more isolationist stance, withdrawing from the Paris Agreement, the United Nations Human Rights Council and the World Health Organization. The US also equally diminished the region\u2019s hopes for stronger trade and diplomatic relations by cancelling the Trans-Pacific Partnership and skipping the ASEAN-related meetings beyond the Manila Summit in 2017. &nbsp;\nWhile it remains uncertain how Trump will steer his second-term administration, the unhealthy geopolitical and geoeconomic ambitions of recent years have damaged global stability and eroded hard-won milestones.\nThe cost has been too high. Victims of humanitarian crises in Gaza, Ukraine, Sudan and elsewhere are left helpless. Measures to combat global challenges such as technological advancement, climate change and health emergencies are hindered by rising protectionist trade measures and industrial policies.\nMeanwhile, many least developed economies are struggling to service unmanageable sovereign debt. These are symptoms of a greater danger and it could threaten Indonesia\u2019s aspiration to become a high-income country by 2045. &nbsp;\nThe world must revive the habit of dialogue and reinforce inclusive principles. Although dialogue may not resolve all issues or satisfy all parties, it fosters mutual understanding and provides a platform for the stocktaking of ideas.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nIt is the inclusive approach that led Indonesia\u2019s founding fathers to coorganizing the Asian-African Conference in 1955, a movement that consolidated ideas of independence and opposition to colonialism.\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Article\nCultural heritage and international cooperation: Keeping things in perspective\nXi says trade war with US will have 'no winners'\nHamas delegation to hold ceasefire talks in Cairo: Official\nMultilateral system in crisis\nHamburg summit seeks solutions for sustainable development financing\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nMore in Opinion\nView more\nAcademia\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo\u2019s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia to evacuate more citizens from Syria\nEntertainment\n'Astro Bot' wins highest award at Oscars of video games\nPolitics\nIndonesia to pardon tens of thousands including Papua activists\nAcademia\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election",

(AFP/Chris Bouroncle)\nH\nuge cranes loom over Peru's massive new Chinese-funded Chancay port, a symbol of Beijing's growing influence in South America which is set to be inaugurated by President Xi Jinping on Thursday.\n\"It's nearly ready,\" Gonzalo Rios, deputy general manager of the Peruvian subsidiary of Chinese port operator Cosco Shipping, which has a 60 percent stake in the facility, said during a recent visit to the deep-water port.\nSituated around 50 miles (80 kilometers) north of the capital Lima, the $3.5 billion complex is expected to become a major hub for trade between South America and China.\nChancay's maximum depth is 17.8 meters (58.4 feet), two meters deeper than Lima's Callao port, making it capable of handling the world's biggest container ships.\n\"With the addition of this port, this part of the Pacific and Peru in particular could become the logistical hub of South America,\" Rios told AFP.\nThe facility will be unveiled by Xi and his Peruvian counterpart Dina Boluarte on the sidelines of this week's Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Lima.\nSouth America's 'Silk Road'&nbsp;\nThe port is the latest addition to the vast collection of railways, highways and other infrastructure projects built under China's massive Belt and Road Initiative.\nLaunched in 2013, the program initially focused on better connecting China with Europe, Africa and the rest of Asia but has since expanded to include South America.\nChancay, a fishing town of around 50,000 inhabitants, was chosen for its strategic location in the heart of South America.\nCosco Shipping Ports, which has a 30-year concession to operate the terminal, has forecast it will handle up to one million containers in its first year of operations.\nChancay is expected to be a major hub for imports of Asian electronics, textiles and other consumer goods and for the export of minerals, including lithium -- a metal used in mobile phone and laptop batteries -- from Chile and copper from both Chile and Peru.\n\"Peru is a source of raw materials for China,\" Oscar Vidarte, professor of international relations at the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru, told AFP.\nBilateral trade between the Asian giant and Peru, one of Latin America's fastest-growing economies for the past decade, stood at nearly $36 billion in 2023, making Peru China's fourth-largest Latin American trading partner.\n\"Our goal is to become the Singapore of Latin America,\" Peruvian Transport Minister Raul Perez told reporters at Chancay.\n\"We will have direct routes to Asia, in particular to China, which will reduce (shipping time) by 10, 15, even 20 days, depending on the route,\" compared to 35-40 days currently, he said.\nChancay port will also serve Chile, Colombia and Ecuador, among other South American countries, allowing them to skirt ports in Mexico and the United States for trade with Asia.\n\"It will allow China to position itself in this part of the world,\" Vidarte said.\nFrancisco Belaunde, a professor in international law at Lima University and other faculties, called it \"part of the battle for geopolitical influence\" in South America pitting China against the United States.\nConnected to the Pan-American highway&nbsp;-- a network of roads linking most of North and South America along the Pacific -- through a mile-long tunnel, the port will use artificial intelligence to inspect containers for drugs and other illicit goods, according to Perez, the transport minister.\nPeru is the world's biggest cocaine producer after Colombia.\nCurrently, much of the drug is smuggled through the port of Guayaquil in neighboring Ecuador.\n\"We will use the most advanced technology to ensure the safety of the containers,\" Perez said.\n&nbsp;\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn

He should not, however, forget East Asia, Pacific and ASEAN countries whose heads of state and government dominated the list of foreign guests attending his inauguration as Indonesia\u2019s eighth president on Oct. 20.\nThe honored guests were visibly pleased when Prabowo called out their full names and titles one by one in his first state address. This has rarely happened in such a state ceremony and can be seen as a trademark for Prabowo\u2019s personal touch. According to Prabowo, 19 heads of state, 19 heads of government and 15 special envoys accepted his invitation.\nPrabowo has grown in prominence internationally since his predecessor Joko \u201cJokowi\u201d Widodo appointed him the defense minister in 2019. After winning the February election, Prabowo toured a number of countries in a show of diplomatic acumen.\n\u201cIn facing the international world, we choose a free and active path, we do not want to join any military pacts. We want to be a good neighbor,\u201d President Prabowo said in his inaugural speech, sending a clear message to his foreign guests.\nEast Asia was represented by South Korean Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, Chinese Vice President Han Zheng and former Japanese foreign minister Masahiko K\u014dmura. As president-elect Prabowo had paid a courtesy call to Chinese President Xi Jinping in Bejing and then Japanese prime minister Fumio Kishida in Tokyo in April. However, Prabowo has not visited Seoul for talks with President Yoon Sook-yeol.\nThe three East Asian nations are Indonesia\u2019s most important trading and economic partners and strategic investment sources. The recurring crisis in the Taiwan Strait, the constant nuclear threats from North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, and the increasing military tensions in the South China Sea are three potential sources of instability in the Indo-Pacific region.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nIn his courtesy call to Vice President\nGibran Rakabuming Raka\n, Han reiterated China\u2019s readiness to \u201ccontinue to deepen the practical cooperation in various fields with the high-quality Belt and Road Initiative [BRI] cooperation taking the lead\u201d.\nHan became the first foreign guest Gibran has received since his inauguration. The young Vice President will need more international exposure, which Prabowo will provide by assigning him to international duties except for major global and multilateral events. Due to his lack of experience in diplomacy, Gibran will need foreign affairs advisors.\nPrabowo has chosen Beijing as the first destination of his inaugural overseas visit. In Beijing Prabowo is scheduled to hold talks with President Xi, amid tension in Indonesia\u2019s exclusive economic zone in Natuna waters, where the Maritime Security Agency (Bakamla) has expelled China Coast Guard vessels three times within the past week.\nDuring his two-week overseas trip, Prabowo will also visit London to meet British PM Keir Starmer and King Charles after attending the APEC and Group of 20 summits in Peru and Brazil, respectively. Prabowo also plans to hold talks with the next United States president.\nPrabowo initially also wished to visit Tokyo again, but as Japan is facing political uncertainty after the new PM Shigeru Ishiba\u2019s ruling party LDP failed to maintain its parliamentary majority, Prabowo decided to postpone the visit. But whoever will be in charge of the Japanese government, even the opposition, Indonesia\u2019s relationship with the world\u2019s fourth-largest economy will remain strong and stable.\nBut what about South Korea? Prabowo has at least a moral obligation to return the attendance of PM Han by making at least a brief visit to Seoul. Han has conveyed an official invitation from President Yoon to President Prabowo. The two countries need to fully settle their stalled military cooperation by seeking a win-win solution while sticking to internationally recognized laws in resolving disputes.\nNow, look at the ASEAN member states, six of whose leaders attended Prabowo\u2019s inauguration. They were Singapore\u2019s PM Lawrence Wong, Malaysian PM Anwar Ibrahim, Brunei\u2019s Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah, Cambodian PM Hun Manet and Philippine President Ferdinand \u201cBongbong\u201d Marcos Jr. They came to show their respect to their new colleague, who had visited them before his inauguration.\nPrabowo wants to go global. But he needs to remember that ASEAN plays a very important role in boosting Indonesia\u2019s influence at the international level. Indonesia cannot go all alone without ASEAN, which has now grown into one of the world\u2019s prominent regional blocs.\nMeanwhile, Pacific countries were represented by New Zealand Deputy PM Winston Peters, Papua New Guinea\u2019s (PNG) PM James Marape, Vanuatu\u2019s PM Charlot Salwai, Timor-Leste\u2019s PM Xanana Gusmao and Solomon Islands\u2019 PM Jeremiah Manele. Indonesia tends to suspect the Pacific region as a major supporter of the Papuan separatist movement and therefore Jakarta\u2019s approach is aimed at keeping the region \u201csilent\u201d about Papua.\nSmall Pacific nations share a strong emotional bond with Papua due to their Melanesian roots. President Prabowo should plan a visit to these nations to build Indonesia\u2019s relationship with them anew. Prabowo has visited PNG, but not yet Timor-Leste, where as a soldier he fought Xanana when the territory was colonized by Indonesia decades ago.\nWhat is also interesting was the attendance of Australia\u2019s Deputy PM and Defense Minister Richard Marles. PM Anthony Albanese promised to attend Prabowo\u2019s inauguration when the Indonesian president-elect visited Canberra in August. However, on Oct. 20, King Charles visited Australia, therefore Albanese assigned his deputy Marles to attend Prabowo\u2019s inauguration on his behalf.\nAustralia once also \u201cblacklisted\u201d Prabowo due to his alleged role in atrocities in then East Timor and other human rights violations. The US only lifted its entry ban of Prabowo when he was appointed Jokowi\u2019s defense minister in 2019.\nApart from making visits, President Prabowo is expected to give a priority to East Asia, ASEAN and the Pacific in his diplomacy. Foreign Minister Sugiono and his three deputies, career diplomats Arrmanatha Christiawan Nasir and Arif Havas Oegroseno and politician Anis Matta, can be assigned to pay more attention to the three regions.\nThe foreign dignitaries who came to Jakarta to witness Prabowo\u2019s ascent to power on Oct. 20 surely expect a payback from Prabowo. They regard Indonesia as a strategic partner and want mutually beneficial relations with the republic.\n***\nThe writer is a senior editor at\nThe Jakarta Post.\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Article\nMegawati supports free meals program, with caveat\nJapan seeks Indonesia\u2019s help to solve labor crisis\nPrabowo to start working in IKN in 2028\nPLN Nusantara Power Showcases Solar PV projects at Japan RE Invest 2024\nASEAN ministers to discuss Myanmar at Thailand meeting, Indonesia says\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nMore in Opinion\nView more\nAcademia\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo\u2019s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia to evacuate more citizens from Syria\nEntertainment\n'Astro Bot' wins highest award at Oscars of video games\nPolitics\nIndonesia to pardon tens of thousands including Papua activists\nAcademia\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election",

(AFP/Marty Melvile)\nT\nhe Pacific Islands Forum has been hit by a \"malicious\" hack, the New Zealand government said Thursday, revealing an attack detected ahead of a recent high-stakes summit.&nbsp;\nLeaders from the 18-member bloc travelled to Tonga in August for an annual meeting dominated by the growing Pacific rivalry between China and the United States.\nMonths earlier, with meeting preparations in full swing, staff noticed a computer breach at the forum's headquarters in Fiji.\n\"New Zealand has been briefed on a cyber incident affecting the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat systems,\" a spokesman for New Zealand's foreign minister said on Thursday.\n\"We remain concerned by the growing number of malicious cyber incidents in our region, targeting national entities and regional organizations,\" the spokesman added.\nIt was not clear who was behind the breach, or what information may have been targeted.\nBut it was considered serious enough at the time that a rapid response team of Australian specialists was sent to help at the forum's request.\n\"Responding to cyber threats and building resilience is a priority for Australia, both at home and in our region,\" said Australia's foreign affairs department.&nbsp;\nForum secretary Baron Waqa, who has warned China and the United States to take their \"fight\" out of the Pacific, would address the incident on Friday, a spokeswoman said.&nbsp;\nThe Pacific Islands Forum has captured increased global attention as China vies for regional influence against the United States and its allies.&nbsp;\nIts members include nations with close links to Washington, others who are warmly disposed to Beijing, and some who still maintain diplomatic ties to Taiwan.&nbsp;\nSolomon Islands, China's main partner in the South Pacific, has been lobbying for Taiwan to be stripped of its \"development partner\" status with the forum.&nbsp;\nThe August meeting was notable for a joint declaration that appeared to reaffirm support for Taiwan's limited participation.\nBut this wording immediately raised the ire of Chinese diplomats, who piled pressure on Pacific leaders to amend the document.&nbsp;\nThe forum reissued the declaration without the offending paragraph, which referenced the bloc's long-standing \"relations with Taiwan\".&nbsp;\nIn a subsequent explanation, it said the references to Taiwan had been included by mistake.\nAsked Thursday about reports in Australian media that Beijing was behind the hack on the Pacific Islands Forum, China's foreign ministry slammed it as \"false information, fabricated for political purposes\".\n\"Its aim is to sow discord between countries in the region and China,\" spokeswoman Mao Ning said.\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Article\nNew president and Indonesia\u2019s foreign policy in Pacific\nMehrtens is free.

(Pool/AFP/Ken Ishii)\nA\nfrican leaders descend on China's capital this week, seeking funds for big-ticket infrastructure projects as they eye mounting great power competition over resources and influence on the continent.\nChina has expanded ties with African nations in the past decade, furnishing them with billions in loans that have helped build infrastructure but also sometimes stoked controversy by saddling countries with huge debts.\nChina has sent hundreds of thousands of workers to Africa to build its megaprojects, while&nbsp;tapping the continent's vast natural resources including copper, gold, lithium and rare earth minerals.\nBeijing has said this week's China-Africa forum will be its largest diplomatic event since the Covid-19 pandemic, with leaders of South Africa, Nigeria, Kenya and other nations confirmed to attend and dozens of delegations expected.\nAfrican countries were \"looking to tap the opportunities in China for growth\", Ovigwe Eguegu, a policy analyst at consultancy Development Reimagined, told AFP.\nChina, the world's number two economy, is Africa's largest trading partner, with bilateral trade hitting US$167.8 billion in the first half of this year, according to Chinese state media.\nProspects\nEvery Monday\nWith exclusive interviews and in-depth coverage of the region's most pressing business issues, \"Prospects\" is the go-to source for staying ahead of the curve in Indonesia's rapidly evolving business landscape.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nBeijing's loans to African nations last year were their highest in five years, research by the Chinese Loans to Africa Database found. Top borrowers were Angola, Ethiopia, Egypt, Nigeria and Kenya.\nBut analysts said an economic slowdown in China has made Beijing increasingly reluctant to shell out big sums.&nbsp;\nChina has also resisted offering debt relief, even as some African nations have struggled to repay their loans -- in some cases being forced to slash spending on vital public services.&nbsp;\nSince the last China-Africa forum six years ago, \"the world experienced a lot of changes, including COVID, geopolitical tension and now these economic challenges\", Tang Xiaoyang of Beijing's Tsinghua University told AFP.\nThe \"old model\" of loans for \"large infrastructure and very rapid industrialization\" is simply no longer feasible, he said.\nThe continent is a key node in Beijing's Belt and Road Initiative, a massive infrastructure project and central pillar of Xi Jinping's bid to expand China's clout overseas.\nThe BRI has channeled much-needed investment to African countries for projects like railways, ports and hydroelectric plants.\nBut critics charge Beijing with saddling nations with debt and funding infrastructure projects that damage the environment.\nOne controversial project in Kenya, a $5 billion railway -- built with finance from Exim Bank of China -- connects the capital Nairobi with the port city of Mombasa.\nBut a second phase meant to continue the line to Uganda never materialized, as both countries struggled to repay BRI debts.\nKenya's President William Ruto last year asked China for a $1 billion loan and the restructuring of existing debt to complete other stalled BRI projects.&nbsp;\nThe country now owes China more than $8 billion.\nRecent deadly protests in Kenya were triggered by the government's need \"to service its debt burden to international creditors, including China\", said Alex Vines, head of the Africa Program at London's Chatham House.\nIn light of such events, Vines and other analysts expect African leaders at this week's forum to seek not only more Chinese investment but also more favorable loans.\nIn central Africa, Western and Chinese firms are racing to secure access to rare minerals.\nThe continent has rich deposits of manganese, cobalt, nickel and lithium -- crucial for renewable energy technology.\nThe Moanda region of Gabon alone contains as much as a quarter of known global reserves of manganese, and South Africa accounts for 37 percent of global output of the metal.\nCobalt mining is dominated by the Democratic Republic of Congo, which accounts for 70 percent of the world total. But in terms of processing, China is the leader, at 50 percent.\nMounting geopolitical tensions between the United States and China, which are clashing over everything from the status of self-ruled Taiwan to trade, also weigh on Africa.\nWashington has warned against what it sees as Beijing's malign influence.\nIn 2022, the White House said China sought to \"advance its own narrow commercial and geopolitical interests [and] undermine transparency and openness\".\nBeijing insists it does not want a new cold war with Washington but rather seeks \"win-win\" cooperation, promoting development while profiting from boosted trade.\n\"We do not just give aid, give them help,\" Tsinghua University's Tang said.\n\"We are just partners with you while you are developing. We are also benefiting from it.\"\nBut analysts fear African nations could be forced to pick sides.&nbsp;\n\"African countries lack leverage against China,\" Development Reimagined's Eguegu said.\n\"Some people [...] think you can use the US to balance China,\" he said. \"You cannot.\"\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Article\nChina\u2019s fast-changing economic adjustments\nGovt eyes 10% investment growth, chipmaking to achieve GDP target\nBiden pushes new Russia, Iran, Korea, China effort before Trump term\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources\nGovt halts big infrastructure in trade-off for food security: Minister\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nMore in Business\nView more\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nTech\nMinister says Apple 'losing out' by dragging its feet on $1b investment\nRegulations\nMinistry inks collab with army, police on food security\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo\u2019s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nEntertainment\n'Astro Bot' wins highest award at Oscars of video games\nPolitics\nIndonesia to pardon tens of thousands including Papua activists\nAcademia\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?",

(Reuters/Athit Perawongmetha)\nW\ne call on outgoing President Joko \"Jokowi\" Widodo to use the worsening conflict along Myanmar's borders as an excuse to launch a new diplomatic offensive by engaging outside powers, especially China, to bring peace back to Myanmar.\nThe President could instruct Foreign Minister Retno LP Marsudi to immediately consult with her ASEAN counterparts to realize the initiative, for the sake of the well-being of millions of people in Myanmar, who have had to bear the brunt of the crisis.\nIndonesia should not hesitate to take this opportunity if it really intends to find a solution to the protracted conundrum in Myanmar. Since the Feb. 1, 2021, military coup in Myanmar, ASEAN has been persistent in dealing with the ensuing security and humanitarian crisis alone. Such rigidity is no longer relevant because it is evident that the Myanmar problem has spilled over to the region and beyond.\nIn their joint statement, issued after their summit in Jakarta in September last year, ASEAN leaders condemned the continuing acts of violence in Myanmar, which have caused prolonged suffering among the people, humanitarian crises and the destruction of public facilities, and have adversely impacted regional stability, particularly along the borders.\nThey decided to extend the temporary expulsion of the junta from any official meetings and functions of ASEAN until Myanmar\u2019s military junta complies with the five-point consensus (5PC). Such a tactic has proven ineffective, which is why ASEAN needs to find alternative measures.\nUnder Indonesia\u2019s chairmanship last year, ASEAN hardly made progress in solving the Myanmar cause. But now in the final months of his term, Jokowi&nbsp;can change the game.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nJokowi has a good personal relationship with Chinese President Xi Jinping. And the engagement of Beijing is not a na\u00efve consideration. Whoever is in power in Myanmar, China\u2019s influence in the country will remain strong.\nThe military junta has been facing more serious armed resistance in the last several months. Video footage has been spread by rebels that purportedly shows them gaining ground in Shan state, which borders China.\nChina was reportedly upset because the Myanmar junta ignored Beijing\u2019s warning about the security situation at the border, where criminals are targeting Chinese nationals.\nOn Monday, the Chinese Foreign Ministry\u2019s spokesperson Mao Ning said that China facilitated the evacuation of a number of countries\u2019 citizens, including Thai citizens, from northern Myanmar through China to avoid conflict and will continue to maintain communication with relevant countries and provide assistance.\nASEAN worries that civil war will continue raging in Myanmar, and the people\u2019s suffering will be prolonged.&nbsp;No matter how slim the chance is, Indonesia and ASEAN should not miss the opportunity to end the Myanmar crisis.

(AFP/Pavel Volkov)\nR\nussian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping were set to participate Thursday in a regional summit in Central Asia bringing together numerous countries opposed to the West.\nPutin and Xi regularly meet under the aegis of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) alliance, whose latest session is being held in Kazakhstan's capital city of Astana.&nbsp;\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is also attending, since his country is a \"dialogue partner\" with the bloc, whose full members including ex-Soviet Central Asian states, India, China, Russia and Iran.\nOn Wednesday, Putin had bilateral meetings with Erdogan and Xi ahead of the main session, telling the Chinese leader that the Shanghai alliance was strengthening its role as \"one of the key pillars of a fair multipolar world order\".\nBoth countries have railed against what they call US-led \"hegemony\" on the world stage.\nXi, criticised in the West for his growing support for Moscow, told Putin Wednesday he was delighted to see his \"old friend\" again.\nErdogan also met Putin on the sidelines Wednesday, inviting him to Turkey and calling for a \"fair peace that can satisfy both sides\" in Ukraine. The Turkish leader has sought to mediate between the warring countries.\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is not attending.\nCompetition with West&nbsp;\nThe SCO was founded in 2001 but has come to prominence in recent years. Its nine full member countries are China, India, Iran, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Pakistan and Tajikistan.\nIt is intended to be a platform for cooperation in competition with the West, with a focus on security and economics.\nA year after Western-sanctioned Iran joined as a full member, Belarus, also ostracised for its backing for Russia's war in Ukraine, will become the 10th full member Thursday.\nBelarusian President Alexander Lukashenko in an interview with Kazakh media praised the alliance for \"demonstrating to the world that there are alternative international platforms, different centres of power\".\nThe alliance claims to represent 40 percent of the global population and about 30 percent of its GDP but it is a disparate group with many internal disagreements including territorial disputes.\nWhile Russia and China are united against Western domination, they are economic competitors in Central Asia, a region rich in oil and gas that is also a crucial transport route between Asia and Europe.\nAlternative routes&nbsp;\nThe summit includes Gulf states among its \"dialogue partners\" and in a sign of its growing importance, United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres is set to address delegates Thursday.\nWith the event's security focus, Afghanistan is a likely topic. It has observer status in the SCO but has been absent since the Taliban took power in 2021.\nNone of the members have formally recognised the Taliban government but China has named an ambassador to Kabul, Kazakhstan has removed the Taliban from its list of banned organisations and Moscow has said it will do the same.\nBut the SCO's main thrust is economic ties between member countries and developing giant projects to link up China and Europe via Central Asia.&nbsp;\nRussia's invasion of Ukraine has increased major powers' interest in the region, where Moscow is seeking to maintain its traditional sway but where China now has strong ties through its flagship Belt and Road infrastructure project, while the West is also vying for influence.\nWestern sanctions against Russia have blocked much-used transport links between China and Europe and prompted the European Union to seek alternative routes including through Central Asia.\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Article\nPreparing for total war\nAssad's fall in Syria exposes limits of China's Middle East diplomacy\nGive the new FM time\nTrump threatens 100 percent tariff on BRICS countries\nChina says top military official Miao Hua suspended, under investigation\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nMore in World\nView more\nEurope\nUS announces new arms aid package for Ukraine worth $500 million\nMiddle East and Africa\nUS says Israel is acting in Syria for its own defence\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia welcomes UNGA resolution on immediate ceasefire in Gaza\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo\u2019s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nEntertainment\n'Astro Bot' wins highest award at Oscars of video games\nPolitics\nIndonesia to pardon tens of thousands including Papua activists\nAcademia\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?",

(Pool/AFP/Asanka Ratnayake)\nC\nhinese Premier Li Qiang mixed a dash of \"panda diplomacy\" with a visit to a historic vineyard on Sunday to celebrate a thaw in once-icy trade ties with Australia.\nThe highest ranking Chinese official to visit Australia in seven years, Li's four-day trip offers the prospect of greater trade after Beijing lifted punitive measures against a string of major Australian exports.\nChina is by far Australia's biggest trading partner, taking in nearly 30 percent of its exports last year including major commodities iron ore and coal.\nTwo-way trade reached A$327 billion (US$216 billion) in 2023.\nSetting the warmer tone, Li took a trip to Adelaide Zoo in bright sunshine and announced China would loan new \"adorable\" giant pandas to replace popular pair Wang Wang and Fu Ni.\nThe Adelaide pandas, which have failed to produce offspring since their arrival in 2009, will return to China by the end of the year.\nProspects\nEvery Monday\nWith exclusive interviews and in-depth coverage of the region's most pressing business issues, \"Prospects\" is the go-to source for staying ahead of the curve in Indonesia's rapidly evolving business landscape.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\n\"I guess they must have missed their home a lot,\" said Li, the second most powerful man in China after President Xi Jinping.\nThe premier said China made the panda offer to honour the wishes of Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong, an Adelaide resident who has worked to stabilise the relationship with Beijing.\nWong said her own children would be \"very happy\" at the news, which she welcomed as a \"symbol of goodwill\".\nLi then joined Wong for a lunch at the 19th century Magill Estate vineyard, home of the original Penfolds winery and now part of the Australian global winemaker Treasury Wine Estates.\nWine was among a string of Australian exports, along with coal, timber, barley, beef, and lobsters, battered by Chinese sanctions in 2020 during a diplomatic rift with the former conservative government.\nThose sanctions cost Australian exporters an estimated A$20 billion a year, including A$1 billion for the wine industry.\nThe tariffs have been gradually lifted since Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's government took power in 2022 and adopted a softer diplomatic approach towards China. Lobster is one of the few exports still facing trade barriers.\nLi and Albanese are set to hold talks behind closed doors in Canberra on Monday, encompassing fractious issues of foreign influence, human rights, alleged \"unsafe\" behaviour by China's military in the region, and their rivalry in the Pacific.\nChina's growing clout in the South Pacific, where it seeks to expand security and economic ties with island states traditionally allied with Australia, remains a notable point of tension.\n\"We're in a state of permanent contest in the Pacific. That's the reality,\" Wong told a television interviewer Sunday.\nBut the Chinese premier, who will also head to a lithium mine in Perth, is focusing his attention on economic opportunities despite areas of friction.\n\"Mutual respect, seeking common ground while shelving differences and mutually beneficial cooperation\" are key to the relationship, Li said on his arrival in Adelaide on Saturday.\nAustralia has endured \"a long period of deep freeze, where it was not possible to have any sort of official conversations with China\", said Melissa Conley Tyler, honorary fellow at the University of Melbourne's Asia Institute.&nbsp;\nLi's visit sends a message that \"Australia is back to being seen as a friendly country rather than the unfriendly, hostile country we were seen as during those years of maximum tension,\" she told AFP.\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Article\nOfficials to form new import task force separate from Trade Ministry\nForeign Minister Sugiono lists priorities in debut meeting with lawmakers\nChina's Xi calls for more free trade\nHow a second Trump presidency will impact Indonesia\u2019s economy\nRubio pick signals a Trump China policy that could go beyond tariffs\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nMore in Business\nView more\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nTech\nMinister says Apple 'losing out' by dragging its feet on $1b investment\nRegulations\nMinistry inks collab with army, police on food security\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo\u2019s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nEntertainment\n'Astro Bot' wins highest award at Oscars of video games\nPolitics\nIndonesia to pardon tens of thousands including Papua activists\nAcademia\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?",

Chung Sung-Jun/Pool via REUTERS (Reuters/Chung Sung-Jun)\nI\nn their joint declaration that capped their&nbsp;trilateral summit on May 27, host South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and Chinese Premier Li Qiang paid much attention to the strategic importance of ASEAN, apparently because the three leaders found it impossible to find common ground on North Korea, the Taiwan Strait and other regional security threats.\nOne of the prominent examples of their common view on ASEAN is their agreement to use the ASEAN-led Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), billed as the world\u2019s largest free trade agreement, as the basis for&nbsp;their negotiations to reach a much more sophisticated trade pact among them.\nAccording to media reports, the three East Asian leaders agreed to \"keep discussions for speeding up negotiations for a Trilateral FTA\".\nIn their joint statement, the three leaders affirmed \u201cthe importance of ensuring implementation in a transparent, smooth and effective manner of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) Agreement as the basis of a Trilateral Free Trade Agreement (FTA)\u201d.\n\u201cWe will keep discussions for speeding up negotiations for a Trilateral FTA, aiming at realizing a free, fair, comprehensive, high-quality, and mutually beneficial FTA with its own value,\u201d the joint statement reads.\nIt remains too early to get a clearer picture of how ASEAN nations will benefit from the political rapprochement among their northeastern&nbsp;neighbors, which are among their most important trading and investment partners. China and Japan&nbsp;have been competing for influence in&nbsp;Southeast Asia, while South Korea is smartly playing the alternative role thanks to its advanced technology.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nJapanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has softened his ambition to revive the stalled free trade scheme, the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), which was originally aimed at, among other goals, containing China in what was supposed to be&nbsp;close collaboration with the United States.\nIt seems the turnaround has helped the Japanese leader achieve&nbsp;major progress in the negotiation of the trilateral free trade agreement during the Seoul summit. The talks stalled in 2019 because of China\u2019s objections.\nChina, the world\u2019s second-largest economy, Japan, the fourth, and South Korea, the 14\nth\n, are parties to the RCEP, which was approved in 2020 but came into effect on Jan. 1, 2022. Aside from the 10-member ASEAN, other signatories of the legally binding agreement are Australia and New Zealand.\nKishida said, as quoted by the Japanese Foreign Ministry, that Japan intends to have a candid exchange of views on how a future-oriented trilateral free trade agreement should be organized, including&nbsp;high-level economic discipline&nbsp;among the three countries, which have deep ties in both trade and investment, aiming for an RCEP-plus agreement.\nAs recently as February, Japan and the US had supported&nbsp;the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), which grouped mostly Western countries and sought to contain China. However, under president Donald Trump in 2016, Washington axed the TPP.&nbsp;\nHoping the US would return to the trade bloc someday, Japan and Australia sponsored the CPTPP. But later they realized that the US would never come back. As if to add insult to injury, China applied to join the new trade bloc.\nThe CPTPP was practically dead when Joe Biden took office in January 2021. The US president opted not to revive the TPP because of strong domestic opposition to the trade pact.\nBiden then proposed the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF), which did not need the approval of&nbsp;Congress. ASEAN countries accepted the invitation to join the new group more as a matter of diplomatic courtesy to Biden.\nDuring the Seoul summit, the three East Asian leaders expressed their commitment to a closer relationship with ASEAN, one of the world\u2019s most powerful regional organizations and which continues to attract attention from global powers, including the US and its allies.\nChinese Premier Li Qiang praised what he called a restart in relations with Japan and South Korea as he met President Yoon and PM Kishida for the first three-way talks&nbsp;in four years, agreeing to revive trade and security dialogues hampered by global tensions.\n\"For China, South Korea&nbsp;and Japan, our close ties will not change, the spirit of cooperation achieved through crisis response will not change and our mission to safeguard regional peace and stability will not change,\" Li said as quoted by Reuters.\nLi also emphasized close ties with ASEAN, given the region\u2019s stability and stellar economic performance.\n\u201cChina, Japan and South Korea should leverage their respective development strengths to create a new engine for regional cooperation that actively addresses the needs of ASEAN and other neighboring countries. The three countries should work together to boost the momentum of ASEAN Plus Three cooperation,\u201d Premier Li said, as quoted by Xinhua.\nASEAN+3 refers to a dialogue forum involving&nbsp;ASEAN,&nbsp;China, Japan and South Korea that. was initiated in December 1997 and has since evolved to be&nbsp;the main vehicle to promote East Asian cooperation.\nKishida concurred, acknowledging ASEAN\u2019s pivotal role in maintaining peace in the Indo-Pacific region, where great power&nbsp;rivalry is simmering.\n\u201cASEAN plays a central role in regional stability and prosperity and also welcomes the revitalization of the trilateral process. It is thus more and more important for the three countries to cooperate with ASEAN for mainstreaming ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific [AOIP]&nbsp;in order to bring about stability and prosperity in the region,\u201d&nbsp;Kishida said.\nIt remains to be seen how ASEAN will seize the opportunities up for grabs following the Seoul trilateral summit. ASEAN could&nbsp;be an unlikely beneficiary of&nbsp;the tensions and competition among its&nbsp;three northeastern neighbors.\nFor Indonesia, the new development is&nbsp;low hanging fruit, especially for the incoming government.

(Reuters/pool/Chung Sung-Jun) (Reuters/Chung Sung-Jun)\nVersi Bahasa Indonesia\nAfter stalling for more than four years, South Korea, China and Japan finally held their annual trilateral summit on Monday in Seoul. Although the conference saw no substantial progress in the efforts to address politically sensitive issues, the fact that the leaders of the three countries were willing to convene at all contributed much to a meaningful reduction of tension and distrust among them.\nThe 8th Trilateral Business Summit brought together South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol as the host, Chinese Premier Li Qiang and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida.\nWhile President Xi Jinping's absence might raise questions about Beijing's genuine commitment to the relationship with its two neighbors, it is common practice for either the president or the premier to represent China at multilateral meetings.\nThe situation in Northeast Asia is very dangerous. North Korean leader Kim Jong-un is threatening nuclear war, and China is trying to take over Taiwan under a reunification narrative. These are among the reasons that war could break out in the region. Meanwhile, Beijing, Tokyo and Seoul are at odds with each other.\nThe world watched as the leaders shook hands, discussed issues and made a joint declaration. The three countries are the most important trading and economic partners of ASEAN.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nSoutheast Asian countries closely follow the development of their very wealthy northeastern neighbors: China is the world\u2019s second-largest economy, followed by Japan and South Korea, and their combined GDP accounts for more than 20 percent of the global GDP.\nIndonesia considers the China, Japan and South Korea as its most important investors and trading partners and crucial to its economy. This is why the three countries are always on the mind of any Indonesian president.\nIn their joint declaration, Yoon, Kishida and Li said maintaining peace, stability and prosperity on the Korean Peninsula and in Northeast Asia were in everyone's interest. They also agreed to the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and to make positive efforts for the political settlement of the peninsula\u2019s issue.\nDespite differing views on the two main issues and the reluctance of Yoon and Kishida to distance themselves from their main military ally the United States, as Beijing has often requested, the meeting made progress on a number of fronts.\nIn a surprising turn of events, Pyongyang announced hours before the summit that it would soon put a much more deadly spy satellite into orbit. The announcement was not well received by either Yoon or Kishida and it also caused concern for Li, whose country is the most important trading partner and North Korea\u2019s only ally.\nIt is to be expected that any political or military instability and tension will have both direct and indirect impacts on the 10-member ASEAN. It would be remiss not to mention the fact that the three countries, in particular China and Japan, are engaged in a high-level competition to boost their influence and power among economically weaker nations. ASEAN is also becoming increasingly concerned about Beijing\u2019s assertiveness in the South China Sea.\nThe three leaders said they wanted to work more with the regional bloc through the ASEAN Regional Forum and the East Asia Summit. They also talked about the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) led by ASEAN, the world\u2019s second-largest trading bloc. All three major economies are part of the RCEP.\nDespite their disagreements and different approaches, the summit made progress in economy and trade, climate change, people-to-people exchanges, science and health, and aging populations.\nPresident Yoon deserves a pat on the back for successfully completing the pretty tough mission of bringing the three countries together. This was definitely a big win. And the three leaders made some progress, even if it wasn't earth-shattering.\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Article\nASEAN ministers to discuss Myanmar at Thailand meeting, Indonesia says\nChina sends naval, air forces to shadow US plane over Taiwan Strait\nPrabowo mulls extending tour to Middle East\nXi, Biden attend APEC summit, prepare to meet\nPrabowo lands in Peru for APEC Summit\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nMore in Opinion\nView more\nAcademia\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo\u2019s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nEntertainment\n'Astro Bot' wins highest award at Oscars of video games\nPolitics\nIndonesia to pardon tens of thousands including Papua activists\nAcademia\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?",

(Reuters/Florence Lo)\nA\nnational election in the Solomon Islands, the first since Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare signed a security pact with Beijing, will be watched next week for its potential to jolt the United States-China rivalry in the South Pacific.\nThe US and Australia are concerned about China's naval ambitions in Pacific countries, as tensions rise over Taiwan.\nDespite its population of just 700,000, the Solomon Islands occupies a strategic position 1,600 kilometers northeast of Australia, strewn with World War Two wrecks that remind it was once a pivotal battlefield.\nVoters will be focused on hospitals struggling without medicines, education shortcomings and inadequate roads when they cast ballots on Wednesday, April 17, opposition party lawmakers said.\nBut Sogavare's rapid embrace of China since he won power four years ago \u2014 including inviting Chinese police into the archipelago and switching diplomatic ties from Taiwan \u2014 is also in the spotlight.\n\"The services and economy are really in a desperate situation. The issue of China and this new relationship is also important. That is a source of anger towards Sogavare,\" said Democratic Alliance Party leader Rick Houenipwela, who was prime minister before Sogavare.\nSogavare, installed as prime minister by independent candidates who won a combined 37% of the vote in 2019, has pointed to hosting the Pacific Games as a major achievement and pledged to strengthen relations with China.\nChina donated stadiums for the Games, and is building ports, roads and a Huawei telecommunications network.\nOpposition parties said they would scrap the China security pact or hold a national referendum on it, and reduce China's influence by accepting more infrastructure support from US allies.\n&nbsp;\n'Not convinced'\nPeter Kenilorea, whose United Party won 10 percent of votes in 2019, said he wants Solomon Islands to return to being a reliable partner of Australia and New Zealand, and would abolish the China security pact.\n\"We're not convinced it's in the interests of Solomon Islands,\" he said.\nClosely watched will be election results in Malaita, the most populous province, which has long criticized deepening China ties and is where opposition parties hope to gain nine seats.\nMalaita's governor Daniel Suidani refused to allow Chinese companies to operate in the province until he was ousted in a no-confidence vote in 2023.\nHis replacement, Martin Fini, has signed Chinese cooperation deals, including last week, when China's special envoy for the Pacific Qian Bo visited Malaita.\nThe prime minister is selected by winning lawmakers, often weeks after the election results.\nHouenipwela's party has formed a coalition with Matthew Wale's Solomon Islands Democratic Party, which won the biggest vote (14 percent) in 2019, and is seeking a combined majority of 26 seats.\nAustralian National University Pacific expert Graeme Smith said the shift away independents was a significant development this election, with Sogavare also convincing many government members to join his new party.\nAustralia has sent 400 police and military to assist Royal Solomon Islands Police Force (RSIPF) with election security, alongside New Zealand and Pacific forces. Chinese police will remain in a training role, the RSIPF said.\nElection observer groups from Australia, New Zealand, the Pacific, Japan, Europe and the US will monitor voting and counting, with national and provincial polls held on the same day.\nSogavare, who didn't respond to a request for comment, has said publicly he would not host a Chinese military base \u2014 which Washington and Canberra have said is a red line.\nChina says its security cooperation Solomon Islands is a sovereign matter for the two countries and has denied it wants a military base, but US military leaders remain unconvinced.\n\"The increased policing presence in the Solomon Islands is concerning, that's a foot in the door, and then we'll see where it goes from there,\" commander of the US Indo Pacific Command, Adm. John Aquilino, said in an interview.\n\"But the goal is to have the ability to deliver infrastructure and ultimately a place for Chinese military power.\"\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Article\nAustralia to charge tech companies for news content if they do not pay\nBiden pushes new Russia, Iran, Korea, China effort before Trump term\nDharma\u2019s surprising uptick in support reflects growing protest votes\nRidwan gears up for runoff despite rival claiming single-round victory\nIndonesian government aims to return foreign prisoners by January\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nMore in World\nView more\nEurope\nUS announces new arms aid package for Ukraine worth $500 million\nMiddle East and Africa\nUS says Israel is acting in Syria for its own defence\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia welcomes UNGA resolution on immediate ceasefire in Gaza\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo\u2019s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia to evacuate more citizens from Syria\nEntertainment\n'Astro Bot' wins highest award at Oscars of video games\nPolitics\nIndonesia to pardon tens of thousands including Papua activists\nAcademia\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election",

(AFP/Kenzo Tribouillard)\nG\net-togethers of foreign diplomats, in both formal and informal settings, are always fascinating. Our friendly conversations may range from sharing jokes, at times political jokes, to lengthier discussions on global challenges and certain topics.\nDuring our latest gathering, we shared our impressions on various national elections that have been and will be held in 2024. Naturally, one of the most popular topics was the November election in the United States.\nWe shared our thoughts on the possible international impact of the front-runners, if he or she were elected to lead the US, and whether Donald Trump will pursue a similar diplomatic approach as he did when he served as the country\u2019s 45th president from 2017 to 2021.\nWhile discussing this very topic of legacy in terms of foreign policy and diplomacy, I wondered how we will remember the leadership of President Joko \u201cJokowi\u201d Widodo.\nPerhaps foreign policy observers and pundits will see him as a diplomat in chief who was rather indifferent to foreign policy and diplomacy. They might argue that his absence at the annual United Nations General Assembly as confirmation of this inclination.\nThey might also argue that he left a major part of Indonesia\u2019s foreign policymaking and diplomacy in the hands of professionals at the Foreign Ministry under the stewardship of Foreign Minister Retno LP Marsudi.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nIn my opinion however, there are three foreign policy issues that have President Jokowi\u2019s strong signature and can therefore be claimed as his legacy.\nThe first concerns the policy decision on downstreaming Indonesia\u2019s natural resources, particularly critical minerals like nickel. This policy is an assertion of sovereignty in managing our natural resources.\nThe industrial countries that rely on raw materials from resource-rich countries like Indonesia opposed this strategic decision, reasoning that such a policy jeopardized continuity in their domestic industrial production and would harm their workforce. For that matter, the European Union filed a case against Indonesia at the World Trade Organization, which is now entering the appeal process.\nFor its part, the EU unilaterally introduced the EU Deforestation Regulation (EUDR). Its enforcement by the end of 2024 will affect millions of smallholder farmers in the developing world, including Indonesia.\nIn a strong rebuttal to this unilateralism, President Jokowi stated during the opening of the ASEAN-EU commemorative summit in Brussels on Dec. 14 2022: \u201cIf we want to build a good partnership, the partnership must be based on equality, no coercion. There should not be any dictating parties who believe that their standard is better than others\u2019.\u201d\nThe notion of partnership as he highlighted is also manifest in our green commitments to protect the environment. This is the second foreign policy issue on which President Jokowi has left his mark.\nIn 2021, Indonesia released the legally binding Forestry and Other Land Use (FOLU) Net Sink 2030. This document outlines Indonesia\u2019s ambitious plan to achieve carbon neutrality in the FOLU sector by reducing emissions from deforestation, forest degradation and carbon-rich peatlands.\nIndonesia also actively promotes the restoration of forests, peatlands and mangroves as nature\u2019s excellent tools in absorbing carbon.\nSpeaking at the Oslo Tropical Forest Forum in June 2024, Environment and Forestry Minister Siti Nurbaya quoted professor Matt Hansen from the University of Maryland, who confirmed a sharp decline in Indonesia's annual deforestation rate from 2016 to 2023 to the lowest levels in 33 years.\nAt this point in time, Indonesia must allocate from funds its own coffers to achieve the FOLU Net Sink 2030 targets. However, going it alone to fulfill its emissions reduction commitment, which requires billions of dollars in investment, will not be highly impactful.\nInternational support and partnership with various stakeholders, based on trust and not patronization, is key in ensuring the success of developing countries in meeting their emissions targets. A good example of this is the US$156 million results-based financing from the Norwegian government for FOLU 2030, which is seen as recognition of Indonesia\u2019s serious commitment.\nThis contribution is managed by the Environmental Fund Management Agency (BPDLH), which was set up under the Finance Ministry and allows a wide range of stakeholders, including philanthropies and private sector businesses, to take part in the resource mobilization campaign.\nSetting up a trust fund to optimize Indonesia\u2019s foreign policy objectives is, in my opinion, the third legacy of President Jokowi.\nIn 2019 with his blessing, the government established the Indonesian Agency for International Development (Indonesian AID) to enable rapid mobilization of funds to assist developing countries affected by natural disasters and calamities.\nThe trust fund enables Indonesia to structure development assistance programs more rigorously, in a more impactful manner and with greater accountability. Before the establishment of Indonesian AID there was always a lapse in time between declaring commitments to help and their realization.\nAs a matter of fact, promoting social justice internationally is mandated by the Constitution. Looking back, Indonesia has shown sympathy and solidarity to the plight of other nations in need since the early days of independence.\nIn 1946, while Indonesia was fighting against recolonization attempts, the founding fathers provided 500,000 tonnes of rice to India, which was experiencing food shortages.\nAll and all, solidarity with the Global South through South-South cooperation as well as technical and development assistance has always had a special place in Indonesia\u2019s foreign policy.\nSuccessive governments continued to give special attention to this foreign policy feature and with Indonesian AID today, we are better able to concretize this spirit of solidarity.\nI have outlined the three foreign policy legacies of President Jokowi that can be enhanced further.\nFirst is by setting aside proceeds from critical minerals downstreaming into a sovereign wealth fund. Indonesia\u2019s future generations should also benefit from the finite natural resources being extracted today.\nSecond is by maximizing the use of processed commodities for domestic consumption, such as absorbing more biofuels made from palm oil. This is in anticipation of more unilateral regulations like the EUDR.\nAs a final thought, as with other nations, Indonesia will continue to face streams of global challenges and new strategic issues. How we respond to these and define our foreign policy posture will very much depend on clarity in translating our national interests.\nWho knows? Perhaps this is another topic I can explore with my fellow diplomats at our next gathering.\n***\nThe writer is Indonesian Ambassador to Norway and Iceland.

(Reuters/Adrian Portugal)\nA\nlack of unity among ASEAN nations is regarded as the core stumbling block to immediately concluding the long-awaited code of conduct (COC) in the South China Sea, which had been expected to establish a guiding framework for preventing an open conflict in the troubled waters.\nASEAN Secretary-General Kao Kim Hourn revealed recently that the negotiations between the association and China would be completed by next year, but many remain doubtful.&nbsp;\nDafri Agussalim, the executive director of the ASEAN Studies Center at Gadjah Mada University (UGM) in Yogyakarta, told\nThe Jakarta Post\nthat each ASEAN member seemed to have its own vested interests in China\u2019s economic influence, putting shared interests behind.\n\u201cI\u2019m not too confident about the deadline. You can see that each ASEAN member has its individual interests that it puts ahead of the association\u2019s, which eventually affects all internal negotiations. This is clear in, say, the Myanmar case as well,\u201d Dafri said.\nThe Myanmar political crisis, which has now entered its third year, has put considerable pressure on ASEAN as calls for the association to broker peace have been met with lackluster results. Analysts have pointed to disagreements between ASEAN members, some of which are widely suspected of being sympathetic to Naypyidaw\u2019s illegal junta, as being among the chief causes of the association\u2019s perceived sluggish response.\nRead also:\nWhither ASEAN in the South China Sea?\nDafri further mentioned that ASEAN members\u2019 participation in counter-China military exercises might also send Beijing a signal that the association was not sincere in its diplomatic negotiations.\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Article\nIs Southeast Asia the next frontier for AI?\nASEAN ministers to discuss Myanmar at Thailand meeting, Indonesia says\nIndonesia has not surrendered sovereign rights in the North Natuna Sea\nPrabowo\u2019s new approach to RI-China relations\nASEAN urges early accord on South China Sea code, end to Myanmar violence\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nMore in World\nView more\nEurope\nUS announces new arms aid package for Ukraine worth $500 million\nMiddle East and Africa\nUS says Israel is acting in Syria for its own defence\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia welcomes UNGA resolution on immediate ceasefire in Gaza\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo\u2019s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nPolitics\nIndonesia to pardon tens of thousands including Papua activists\nAcademia\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?\nAcademia\nStop with the LGBTQ scapegoating",

(JP/Dhoni Setiawan)\nIndonesia is home to abundant natural resources, with the potential to become a regional powerhouse in the green energy space.\nIndonesia has an estimated 400 gigawatts (GW) of technical potential for renewable-based power generation. Solar accounts for half of that figure, while hydropower and geothermal could deliver up to 75GW and 29GW capacity respectively. If fully developed, this is more than enough to meet Indonesia\u2019s future demand \u2014 however, the pace of the energy transition must be carefully managed to ensure a just transition.\nThis encouraging outlook reveals Indonesia\u2019s substantial green energy opportunities, with renewables able to deliver as much as two-thirds of the nation\u2019s total energy mix by 2050 \u2014 up from just 14 percent today.\nIndonesia also holds significant potential as a center for carbon capture and storage (CCS), with an estimated four to eight gigatons of carbon dioxide (CO2) storage potential by leveraging depleted oil and gas reservoirs. Utilizing Indonesia\u2019s saline aquifers could add an additional 600 billion tons of CO2 storage potential. This CCS opportunity could significantly accelerate the journey to reduce national CO2 emissions.\nIndonesia is also positioned to become one of the region\u2019s leading producers of green molecules. As an emerging economy with a growing industrial sector, there is an increasing demand for industries such as steel, cement and chemicals switching to green hydrogen to accelerate their decarbonization. The demand for green hydrogen across Asia is projected to reach more than 300 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) by 2050.\nPotential regional energy hub\nProspects\nEvery Monday\nWith exclusive interviews and in-depth coverage of the region's most pressing business issues, \"Prospects\" is the go-to source for staying ahead of the curve in Indonesia's rapidly evolving business landscape.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nWith its significant renewable energy and CCS potential, Indonesia can go beyond meeting its own green energy needs, and act as a regional hub to catalyze the wider decarbonization of Southeast Asia. Its strategic geographical location enables connections with nearby nations through existing and emerging energy interconnections, backed by government commitments to advance renewable energy. This means Indonesia can offer a platform to accelerate decarbonization of neighboring countries in Southeast Asia.\nThis potential is aligned with Indonesia\u2019s commitment to grow the share of renewable energy in the national energy mix, supported by policy interventions and incentives for renewable energy technologies. This could position Indonesia as a leading player in Southeast Asia\u2019s green energy landscape.\nRealizing Indonesia\u2019s potential as a regional green energy hub relies on ensuring fast-track adoption of renewable energy, putting in place the right policies, developing infrastructure and enhancing capabilities across the supply chain to help accelerate the development of renewable energy and CCS technologies.\nSingapore\u2019s import of 2GW of green electrons from Indonesia is an important step. A power export agreement, signed in January 2022 and March 2023, affirms both countries\u2019 commitments to facilitate cross-border electricity trading and interconnections, while also energizing investments in the development of renewable energy manufacturing industries. Exporting green electrons also provides the opportunity to kickstart Indonesia\u2019s domestic renewable energy value chain by compensating for low green electricity demand in the short term. Developing renewable energy manufacturing capabilities can also ensure the security of supply in the long run.\nWhile the potential is significant, realizing this ambition to be a regional green energy powerhouse requires bold moves and policy interventions across demand and supply, as well as enabling infrastructure and collaboration with stakeholders. There are several strategic imperatives for the successful export of green electrons.\nAccelerating adoption of renewable energy technologies\nEstablishing policies to stimulate adoption and demand for renewable energy is the first imperative. This includes tax credits and subsidies to reduce the cost of purchasing and installing renewable energy systems. These incentives make green energy more financially accessible to a broader range of consumers and businesses.\nOther countries have launched incentives and subsidies to accelerate adoption of renewable energy technology. For example, the United States\u2019 Investment Tax Credit (ITC) is an incentive that reduces federal income tax liability for a share of the cost of a solar energy system installed during the tax year. ITC allows homeowners and businesses to deduct a percentage of the cost of installing solar energy systems from their federal taxes. Furthermore, solar energy systems that meet domestic content thresholds are eligible for a 10-percentage point increase in the value of ITC.\nIn India, the government offers a range of subsidies and incentives for solar panel installations under its National Solar Mission. This includes capital subsidies and rebates, as well as tax benefits for both residential and commercial installations.\nIn addition to the range of subsidies and incentives, setting clean energy standards or renewable portfolio standards in the medium term, requiring companies to source a certain share of their energy from renewable sources, will also further accelerate the adoption of renewable technology in the domestic market.\nEnsuring green energy investment for developers, investors\nIt is important to embed an attractive economic environment for investors and operators. Government support in the form of tax incentives for manufacturers and developers, and subsidies and grants for research and development (R&amp;D), play an important role in promoting renewable energy.\nThere are several potential policy levers that could be introduced to incentivize investment. Commercial tariff premiums or above-market rates for renewable energy fed into the national grid can be considered to ensure attractive investment returns for power developers that encourage participation.\nIt is also important to ensure transparent markets and stable policies. A clear, communicated plan for ramping up renewable energy backed by coherent national energy policies that offer long-term stability is vital for investor confidence. Market data should be transparent and accessible to help investors make informed decisions and reduce perceived risks.\nCapabilities, infrastructure and regional collaboration should be strengthened to fast-track Indonesia\u2019s development as a green energy hub.\nSeveral initiatives are required to establish suitable energy infrastructure. Firstly, strengthening and upgrading the domestic power grid to accommodate a growing share of renewable energy sources is essential. This includes investing in smart grid technology, enhancing grid stability and improving energy storage capacities to handle the variable nature of renewable energy sources like solar and wind.\nScaling capability development in green technologies is also key, particularly for emerging opportunities such as green hydrogen and CCS. The government can allocate funding to R&amp;D activities to support this transition. Government support for research institutions, collaboration with universities and incentivizing private sector R&amp;D through tax benefits or direct funding will support this. Coherent policies across demand, supply and infrastructure should be established to ensure the acceleration of capability development across the green value chain.\nIn addition, accelerating the development of Indonesia\u2019s carbon market and implementing suitable carbon taxes are also important to accelerate the development of a green ecosystem and unlock large pools of potential funding.\nFinally, regional collaboration is vital to connect opportunities across Southeast Asia. Partnership is key to developing electricity trading agreements, infrastructure deployment and other licensing requirements. The ASEAN Power Grid, for example, is a crucial initiative to build regional power interconnection between countries within Southeast Asia, which will then enable trade of green electrons across borders.\nWith the right interventions across demand, supply and the enabling ecosystem, Indonesia is poised to emerge as the green energy hub for Southeast Asia. In turn, Indonesia\u2019s new position as a regional green powerhouse will help unlock significant economic and social benefits for the nation.\n***\nMarko Lackovic is a managing director and partner, while Fachry Frisandi a principal&nbsp;at Boston Consulting Group.\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Article\nMegawati supports free meals program, with caveat\nMission to Syria\nIs Southeast Asia the next frontier for AI?\nTrump policies could cast shadow over Indonesia, Asia\nBancassurance in Southeast Asia: The $114 billion opportunity\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nMore in Business\nView more\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nTech\nMinister says Apple 'losing out' by dragging its feet on $1b investment\nRegulations\nMinistry inks collab with army, police on food security\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo\u2019s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia to evacuate more citizens from Syria\nEntertainment\n'Astro Bot' wins highest award at Oscars of video games\nPolitics\nIndonesia to pardon tens of thousands including Papua activists\nAcademia\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election",

(Reuters/Pool/Yasuyoshi Chiba)\nT\nhe East Asia Summit in Jakarta on Thursday may be missing several key world leaders, particularly President Joe Biden of the United States and Xi Jinping of China, but the importance of this annual forum cannot be overstated when it comes to the future of the Indo-Pacific region, increasingly embroiled in big-power rivalry.\nHere, more than anywhere else in the world, is the battleground in the contest for power and influence between China and the US. The growing tension is already impacting international relations. And it could get worse.\nThere are potential flashpoints in the region, Taiwan and the South China Sea in particular, that could lead to military clashes. The specter of World War III, and the use of nuclear weapons, is all too real.\nSoutheast Asia, which straddles the Indian and Pacific oceans, is right in the firing line. It would be among the first casualties of such a war. ASEAN must use all at its disposal to deescalate the current tension and prevent that war from erupting.\nThe East Asia Summit, an annual gathering hosted by ASEAN since 2011, provides the perfect forum for ASEAN to show its diplomatic mettle. Besides the 10 ASEAN member states, the East Asia Summit brings in leaders from Australia, China, India, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea, Russia and the US.\nThere is no other forum, outside the United Nations, that brings leaders from big powers together like the East Asia Summit. This presents ASEAN, and Indonesia as its chair this year, with an opportunity to play their parts in ensuring peace, stability and prosperity for the region and beyond.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nThe Indo-Pacific is where the rivalry between China and the US is being played out. While one is trying to assert its growing power, and the other is trying to contain it.\nOne thing for sure is that China\u2019s rise is no longer perceived as peaceful, as it was in the first decade of the millennium. The military build-up, including but not only in the South China Sea, is a major concern to all about how it would use this newfound power. The Belt and Road Initiative, in which China invests heavily in infrastructure projects in countries spreading from the Pacific islands, through mainland and maritime Asia, the Middle East, the Horn of Africa and all the way to Europe is also seen as China exercising its hegemonic power.\nThe US came up with its Indo-Pacific Strategy last year clearly designed to contain, or deter, China\u2019s power and influence. It has also formed alliances like the Quad (with Australia, Japan and India) and AUKUS (with Australia and the United Kingdom) to strengthen its presence in the region, in addition to old alliances with Japan, South Korea, the Philippines and Thailand.\nOther countries, including distant European powers, have come up with their own Indo-Pacific policies, reflecting the geopolitical strategic values of the region to many countries.\nChina has refused to use the term \u201cIndo-Pacific\u201d, preferring the older \u201cAsia-Pacific\u201d, but semantics aside, it is building its maritime and economic strengths in the Indian Ocean, as well as the Pacific Ocean.\nThe ASEAN Outlook on Indo-Pacific (AOIP) is the group\u2019s answer to this turn of events. While modest in substance, it is ambitious in its goal: to turn the Indo-Pacific into a region of cooperation. The principles in the outlook include rules-based policies, transparency and inclusivity, meaning that everyone, including China, is included. This contrasts with most other Indo-Pacific concepts that try to exclude China.\nASEAN countries have a strong reason to get China on board not only because it is their biggest economic partner. Several member states have territorial disputes with Beijing in the South China Sea. Diplomacy is still the way forward for ASEAN as it is negotiating with China for a binding Code of Conduct in resolving these disputes, which would include refraining from the use of power. Getting China to sign this document would go a long way to reducing tensions in the region. &nbsp;\nUnderpinning the AOIP is ASEAN centrality in the Indo-Pacific region, and this was already recognized by all the major powers even before the AOIP came into being in 2019. The attendance of big powers in many ASEAN forums, including the ASEAN foreign ministers\u2019 meetings, the ASEAN Regional Forum, and in the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), attest to the group\u2019s role in regional and international affairs.\nThis centrality however is contingent upon ASEAN as a group remaining neutral in the Sino-US rivalry. While member states may be aligning with one or the other power, ASEAN as a group must remain neutral, lest it forfeit its centrality.\nASEAN, though, is not without internal challenges that raise questions about its unity, and therefore its effectiveness in playing a central role in the region.\nOne issue that is dividing the group is the membership of Myanmar since the military seized power in 2021 and ruled the country by killing and brutally suppressing its people. For now, Myanmar has been excluded from all high-level meetings, but the issue is already dividing ASEAN, and raising questions about ASEAN\u2019s relevance if it cannot put its own house in order.\nIn his speech opening the 43rd ASEAN Summit in Jakarta on Tuesday, President Joko \u201cJokowi\u201d Widodo rallied his counterparts to stay united even when they hold different opinions.\n\u201cI have been hearing questions whether ASEAN will break up and lose its unity, and whether the ASEAN ship can continue sailing,\u201d he said. \u201cI have to reiterate that ASEAN unity remains intact. Unity should not be equated with a lack of difference of opinions.\u201d\nGiven the challenges externally and internally, ASEAN centrality and unity have never been this important.\n&nbsp;***\nThe writer is senior editor at\nThe Jakarta Post.\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Article\nIndonesia must regain credibility as an honest broker\nVietnam's soaring US trade surplus stokes new fears of tariffs\nASEAN ministers to discuss Myanmar at Thailand meeting, Indonesia says\n'Prabowo could provide unique contribution to reducing tensions in Korean Peninsula'\nTime for ASEAN to have an easy-to-implement geostrategy\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nMore in Opinion\nView more\nAcademia\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo\u2019s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia to evacuate more citizens from Syria\nEntertainment\n'Astro Bot' wins highest award at Oscars of video games\nPolitics\nIndonesia to pardon tens of thousands including Papua activists\nAcademia\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election",

The growing tension is already impacting international relations. And it could get worse.\nThere are potential flashpoints in the region, Taiwan and the South China Sea in particular, that could lead to military clashes. The specter of World War III, and the use of nuclear weapons, is all too real.\nSoutheast Asia, which straddles the Indian and Pacific oceans, is right in the firing line. It would be among the first casualties of such a war. ASEAN must use all at its disposal to deescalate the current tension and prevent that war from erupting.\nThe East Asia Summit, an annual gathering hosted by ASEAN since 2011, provides the perfect forum for ASEAN to show its diplomatic mettle. Besides the 10 ASEAN member states, the East Asia Summit brings in leaders from Australia, China, India, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea, Russia and the US.\nThere is no other forum, outside the United Nations, that brings leaders from big powers together like the East Asia Summit. This presents ASEAN, and Indonesia as its chair this year, with an opportunity to play their parts in ensuring peace, stability and prosperity for the region and beyond.\nThe Indo-Pacific is where the rivalry between China and the US is being played out. While one is trying to assert its growing power, and the other is trying to contain it.\nOne thing for sure is that China\u2019s rise is no longer perceived as peaceful, as it was in the first decade of the millennium. The military build-up, including but not only in the South China Sea, is a major concern to all about how it would use this newfound power. The Belt and Road Initiative, in which China invests heavily in infrastructure projects in countries spreading from the Pacific islands, through mainland and maritime Asia, the Middle East, the Horn of Africa and all the way to Europe is also seen as China exercising its hegemonic power.\nThe US came up with its Indo-Pacific Strategy last year clearly designed to contain, or deter, China\u2019s power and influence. It has also formed alliances like the Quad (with Australia, Japan and India) and AUKUS (with Australia and the United Kingdom) to strengthen its presence in the region, in addition to old alliances with Japan, South Korea, the Philippines and Thailand.\nOther countries, including distant European powers, have come up with their own Indo-Pacific policies, reflecting the geopolitical strategic values of the region to many countries.\nChina has refused to use the term \u201cIndo-Pacific\u201d, preferring the older \u201cAsia-Pacific\u201d, but semantics aside, it is building its maritime and economic strengths in the Indian Ocean, as well as the Pacific Ocean.\nThe ASEAN Outlook on Indo-Pacific (AOIP) is the group\u2019s answer to this turn of events. While modest in substance, it is ambitious in its goal: to turn the Indo-Pacific into a region of cooperation. The principles in the outlook include rules-based policies, transparency and inclusivity, meaning that everyone, including China, is included. This contrasts with most other Indo-Pacific concepts that try to exclude China.\nASEAN countries have a strong reason to get China on board not only because it is their biggest economic partner.

(Reuters/Pool/Yasuyoshi Chiba)\nC\nhinese Premier Li Qiang on Wednesday extolled his country\u2019s \u201cbrotherly ties\u201d with Southeast Asian nations, but skirted the issue of China\u2019s new map that shows Beijing\u2019s claim over some of its neighbors\u2019 waters in the South China Sea.&nbsp;\nDisagreements must be handled through dialogue, Li said, addressing the Association of Southeast Asian Nations leaders in Jakarta.\n\u201cWe have preserved peace and tranquility in East Asia in a world caught with turbulence and change. In particular, we confronted the COVID-19 challenge by coming to each other\u2019s aid in those difficult times,\u201d Li said. \u201cAnd that is a reflection of our brotherly ties in the face of adversity with concrete actions.\u201d\nLi avoided any mention of China\u2019s new map, which was released last month and shows Beijing\u2019s expansive claim over most of the South China Sea, including territories overlapping with the exclusive economic zones of ASEAN countries Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam. Those countries, India and Taiwan have objected to the map.\nIn a statement Wednesday, Indonesia,&nbsp;the ASEAN chair, did not mention the Chinese map, but said disputes over the South China Sea must be settled \u201cin accordance with the universally recognized principles of international law, including the 1982 UNCLOS (the&nbsp;United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea).\u201d\nThe statement also did not specifically mention China Coast Guard firing water cannons at a Philippine Coast Guard ship in the disputed waters.\nIt did say that \u201csome ASEAN member-states\u201d expressed concern about \u201cserious incidents in the area, including actions that put the safety of all persons at risk.\u201d\nRead also:\nASEAN falls silent on South China Sea\nA day earlier Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. in a meeting with his ASEAN counterparts did not name China but made strong statements about territorial integrity.\n\u201cWe do not seek conflict; but it is our duty as citizens and as leaders to always rise to meet any challenge to our sovereignty, to our sovereign rights and our maritime jurisdictions in the South China Sea,\u201d he said.\n\u201cNo country would expect any less. No country would do any less.\u201d\nThe Philippines, he said, calls upon all parties for self-restraint on activities that complicate South China Sea disputes.\n\u201cThe Philippines firmly rejects misleading narratives that frame the disputes in the South China Sea solely through the lens of strategic competition between two powerful countries,\u201d Marcos said.\n\u201cThis not only denies us our independence and our agency, but it also disregards our own legitimate interests.\u201d\nThe US&nbsp;representative at the summit, Vice President Kamala Harris, pledged Washington\u2019s support of ASEAN.\n\u201cASEAN is at the center of America\u2019s commitments to the Indo-Pacific. As the United States Indo-Pacific strategy makes clear we are committed to ASEAN centrality,\u201d Harris said.\n\u201cSince President Biden and I took office we have expanded ASEAN ties. To that end, we have upgraded the relationship to a comprehensive strategic partnership. We invested in infrastructure and the digital economy. We launched major initiatives to address the climate crisis and health security.\u201d\nMyanmar discussions\nASEAN members also addressed the crisis in member-state Myanmar, where a military coup in February 2021 toppled the elected government and unleashed a brutal crackdown on protesters and civilians.&nbsp;\nMore than 4,000 people have been killed and thousands more arrested by security forces since then, according to a monitoring group.\nIn a statement released Wednesday, the ASEAN leaders expressed grave concern over the lack of progress in implementing their&nbsp;five-point consensus&nbsp;on Myanmar adopted in April 2021. It calls for an immediate halt to violence and a dialogue among all parties.\nThe escalation of violence is \u201ccausing prolonged suffering for the people of Myanmar, humanitarian crisis, the destruction of houses and public facilities such as schools, hospitals, markets, churches and monasteries, and adverse impacts on regional stability, particularly along the border region,\u201d the statement said.\nStill, the leaders reiterated their position that the consensus plan remains ASEAN\u2019s main reference to address the Myanmar situation.\nHarris said the US&nbsp;would continue efforts to return democracy to Myanmar.\n\u201cWe have a shared commitment to international rules and norms and to our partnership on pressing national and regional issues such as the crisis in Myanmar,\u201d Harris said.\nShe said the US&nbsp;would \u201cpress the regime to end the horrific violence, to release all those unjustly detained, and to reestablish Myanmar\u2019s path to inclusive democracy.\u201d\nRead also:\nASEAN bars Myanmar from 2026 chairmanship\nIn a separate meeting with leaders of ASEAN, South Korea and Japan, Li urged those leaders to find common ground, avoid a new \u201cCold War\u201d and reject attempts to force countries to take sides.\nChina has accused Washington of a \u201ccold war\u201d mentality as it pushes back against perceived efforts to contain Beijing\u2019s rise as a global superpower.\nBeijing has also suggested that Washington, through its alliances and partnerships with other countries, seeks to isolate or pressure China on issues such as trade, technology and territorial disputes.\n\u201cTo keep differences under control, what is essential now is to oppose picking sides, oppose bloc confrontation, and oppose a new Cold War and to ensure that disagreements and disputes among countries are properly handled,\u201d Li said.\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Article\nBiden pushes new Russia, Iran, Korea, China effort before Trump term\nAssad's fall in Syria exposes limits of China's Middle East diplomacy\nIndonesia women's team reaches first-ever AFF Cup final\nMalaysia urges Chinese firms to avoid using it to dodge US tariffs\nA better alternative to Trump's tariffs\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nMore in World\nView more\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia to evacuate more citizens from Syria\nEurope\nUS announces new arms aid package for Ukraine worth $500 million\nMiddle East and Africa\nUS says Israel is acting in Syria for its own defence\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo\u2019s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia to evacuate more citizens from Syria\nEntertainment\n'Astro Bot' wins highest award at Oscars of video games\nPolitics\nIndonesia to pardon tens of thousands including Papua activists\nAcademia\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election",

But it also portrays the hope of the dawn of a new empire.\nCan we expect the same from the expansion of the Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa (BRICS) bloc with the increasing power of the developing world?\nSince the establishment of the European Union with the&nbsp;\nMaastricht Treaty\non&nbsp; Nov. 1, 1993, the bloc has grown to include 27 member states. As an enormous economic powerhouse, the EU has brought indispensable impacts to both the global economy and security. Its leverage in resources has enabled EU countries to shape the perceptions of global issues, which often deviate from reality.\nHowever, both the EU and the United States are not following a path toward strategic autonomy and are now on the brink of irrelevance.\nIn terms of economic power, the EU accounts for only 15 percent of global Gross Domestic Product (GDP), down from 25 percent in 1990, while BRICS, after six new members join in January 2024 will comprise nearly 30 percent of the global GDP, according to the International Monetary Fund.\nAfter the six new members, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Ethiopia, Egypt, Argentina and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), join the bloc, BRICS will represent 46.5 percent of the world\u2019s population.\nThe five founding and current member countries have argued that their economies and populations are not properly represented in important institutions, particularly the World Bank and the IMF.\nA survey by ISEAS Singapore last year showed that in the eyes of the citizens of Indonesia and other ASEAN countries, the EU no longer has strategic economic or political influence in the region.\nAt the 15th BRICS summit on Aug 22-24, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said \u201cBRICS stands for solidarity and for progress. BRICS stands for inclusivity and a more just, equitable order. BRICS stands for sustainable development. The group has been remarkably consistent on these values and aspirations.\u201d\nEconomics has always been central to the bloc. At its root, it is a collective of emerging economies eager to sustain and improve their economic trajectories. Their insistence on reform is, after all, based on their perceived disproportionate under-representation in global financial institutions.\nEven though many analysts in developed countries see the BRICS expansion as a plunge into uncharted territory as the new actors have widely varied interests, the larger BRICS will increase its envisaged role as a geopolitical alternative to the global institutions dominated by the West.\nIndonesia, BRICS members and other developing countries have been disillusioned and frustrated with EU policies that regulate various industry and trade norms of critical farm commodities. The EU also introduced non-tariff barriers and protectionism measures which will directly affect exports to EU countries.\nThere are at least six trade barriers between Indonesia and BRICS members because of the EU, and additional tariffs for steel which are related to the nickel ore export ban. Currently, Indonesia\u2019s appeal is being examined in the Appellate Body.\nAdditional tariffs on biodiesel exports are currently being disputed at the World Trade Organization (WTO). Furthermore, non-tariff barriers for palm oil have been created because of health concerns as well as tariff and non-tariff barriers in the form of the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) for cement, iron and steel, aluminum, fertilizers, electricity and hydrogen. The new regulation was published on Indonesia\u2019s Independence Day, Aug. 17.\nAnother non-tariff barrier is the EU Deforestation-free Regulation (\nEUDR\n) for soy,&nbsp;beef, palm oil, wood,&nbsp;cocoa, coffee and rubber commodities. All EU-imposed trade barriers violate WTO rules.\nBRICS is in a better position to create a more just trade system for commodities produced by members of the Global South, designed to correct and improve the principle of free trade that has been preached by the West. BRICS principles to promote inclusiveness and a fairer and equitable order will enable the forum to further thrive and grow as one of the most influential global forums.\nThe BRICS spirit of mutual respect and accommodation, sovereign equality, solidarity and democracy, openness and inclusiveness, deepening cooperation and consensus by consultation will enable the forum to further thrive and grow as one of the most influential global forums.\nA thriving BRICS could spur Indonesian socio-economic development, notably in the production of palm oil and critical minerals for renewable energy, two of the most vital commodities and major sources of state revenue for Indonesia and other countries in Africa and Latin America. Although Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand account for more than 85 percent of global palm oil output now, 10 countries in Africa and four countries in Latin America, led by Brazil, are emerging as new palm oil producers with great potential.\nBRICS is expected to develop a new platform for a more just trade system for palm oil and other commodities which must be based on full compliance with national laws, environmental sustainability and social responsibility principles to help producers achieve sustainable and equitable trade relationships. These fundamentals conform with the EU standards.\nAs far as Indonesia is concerned, the emergence of BRICS and our current cases against the EU in the WTO are not meant to be trade wars. Indonesia is looking for fairer trade system that respects the Global South\u2019s right to develop while also recognizing EU concerns about the environmental, social and good governance principles across the supply chain.\n***\nThe writers are sustainability analysts\n.\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Article\nLuigi Mangione was charged with murder - then donations started pouring in\nMalaysia says any US tariffs on BRICS could impact semiconductor supply\nOECD warns of protectionism weeks before Trump return\nASEAN in the global economy: A half-century journey\nIndonesia, beware of the (unnecessary) BRICS trap\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nMore in Paper\nView more\nOpinion\nAnalysis: Govt adopts mandatory B35 biodiesel program as CPO prices tumble\nBusiness\nGlobal chip crunch stunts Indonesia car sales recovery\nBusiness\nXL profit falls in Q3 as tower sale income dries\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo\u2019s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia to evacuate more citizens from Syria\nEntertainment\n'Astro Bot' wins highest award at Oscars of video games\nPolitics\nIndonesia to pardon tens of thousands including Papua activists\nAcademia\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election",

It has also maintained a strong relationship with Indonesia despite being a former colony. On the sidelines of The Jakarta Post\u2019s Democracy Dialogue event on Monday, Timor-Leste President and Nobel Peace laureate\nJos\u00e9 Ramos-Horta\nsat with Tenggara Strategics\u2019\nPhilips J Vermonte\nand the Post\u2019s\nYvette Tanamal\nto discuss Dili-Jakarta relations, democracy and leadership. The following are excerpts from the interview.\nQuestion:\nWhat is your perception of Indonesia given what happened in our past? How do you inspire the Timor-Leste people to not hate Indonesia?\nAnswer:\nMy familiarity and relations with Indonesia goes back a long time. In the late 1960s, I read and saw movies about Sukarno and Indonesia\u2019s struggle for independence. During Portuguese rule, I learned about diplomacy and politics from the former Indonesian consul in Dili, Elias Tomodok, whom I visited often. He was very political; he did not like at all the Portuguese colonial rule but was friendly with the Portuguese governor at public events.\nAt the beginning of the struggle, there was a great leader, Nicolau dos Reis Lobato, who I grew up with in a Catholic mission school. He was extraordinarily intelligent and a humane individual. From day one, he would always say: We are not fighting the Portuguese people, we are not fighting the Indonesian people. We are fighting for independence.\nYears later came Xanana Gusm\u00e3o with the same policy. In speeches, press or political writings, there was never any demonizing of Indonesia or other countries. We never used religion, ethnicity or terror, which is a strategy often used to provoke anger and mobilization.\nIn 1976, when I was lobbying in Washington, there was a congressman called Frank Wolf from Virginia who was a conservative Republican. He initiated a bill to impose mandatory sanctions against any country persecuting Christians, which a friend of mine suggested I take advantage of. My answer was, no; that\u2019s not correct.\nThe problem in Timor-Leste was not Muslims vs. Christians. Many of the [Indonesian] generals involved in the invasion were actually Catholics or Protestants; I made a joke that in Indonesia, violence is non-discriminatory.\nWhen Xanana was detained in a Cipinang prison in Jakarta, he sometimes joked that he was attending the \u201cUniversity of Cipinang\u201d, because there he learned more about the Indonesian people and came to love them.\nWhen leaders do not manipulate people\u2019s sentiments and emotions, there will not be any hatred.\nTimor-Leste is dubbed the best democracy in Southeast Asia. How would you assess the quality of democracy in the region now?\nIt\u2019s very difficult to make any simple or generalized answer about that. I consider Indonesia to have a very dynamic, functional democracy. We can call it imperfect; but that would also apply to the United States democracy, or the Indian democracy. Even with Timor-Leste, despite our high ranking, I should say that ours is an imperfect one.\nDemocracy is something that requires attentiveness and a continuous building on. Gradually, and slowly, it will be consolidated, but never truly definitive. You can see this in the US, or Brazil. In the US, many Americans still want another four years of Donald Trump. That\u2019s democracy.\nI\u2019m not naive or excessively romantic about democracy to make a judgment. I have great admiration for some countries that are not academically or theoretically defined as democracies, but are prosperous, peaceful and with relative freedom for their people to enjoy.\nFor example, the monarchies in the Middle East, or the governments in Jordan, Morocco, the Gulf countries like [the United Arab] Emirates, Qatar. In a very difficult region of the world, they have maintained incredible prosperity and peace. Are they defined as democracies? I don\u2019t know. But I don\u2019t care about it that much.\nDili is applying to ASEAN, which now has to walk a thin line amid the geopolitical tensions between the US and China. How does Timor-Leste position itself?\nAll these years, we have developed a great relationship with everyone, including our immediate neighbors, Indonesia, [which] is number one, then Australia; then others like Singapore, Malaysia; and beyond like Thailand, the Philippines, Vietnam, Cambodia, et cetera.\nWe also have a great relationship with the US and China despite [their] tensions.\nOften, China is misrepresented in said tensions, which has more to do with the economy than the perception or fear that it seemingly wants to dominate the world.\nIn the 1980s, when I was living in New York, Japan was America\u2019s bashing point. Because the Tokyo economy was skyrocketing, they [Japan] bought the Rockefeller Center, which became the ultimate insult. It\u2019s like going to France and buying Notre Dame.\nThat was also economic in nature. China is a global power whether the Americans like it or not. It is a power that benefited from the American economy and the peace in the region. It is only through peace that China prospers. It is not interested in dominating anyone, but being respected because it is that one country in the world that has been abused and invaded more often than any other country. Every little European country has invaded China.\nWe understand that and we don\u2019t see them as a threat to anyone. But in international politics, when interests of countries come into play, there are&nbsp;always tensions. Diplomacy exists to smooth over, negotiate and resolve said tensions. The key here is leadership, whether it be in the US, China, Russia, or elsewhere.\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Article\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nPrabowo\u2019s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nChinese guards on the ground in Myanmar could go disastrously wrong\nHarmonizing the Islamic and circular economies\nEurope\u2019s economy is stalling out\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nMore in Paper\nView more\nOpinion\nAnalysis: Govt adopts mandatory B35 biodiesel program as CPO prices tumble\nBusiness\nGlobal chip crunch stunts Indonesia car sales recovery\nBusiness\nXL profit falls in Q3 as tower sale income dries\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo\u2019s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia to evacuate more citizens from Syria\nEntertainment\n'Astro Bot' wins highest award at Oscars of video games\nPolitics\nIndonesia to pardon tens of thousands including Papua activists\nAcademia\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election",

With peace and stability at stake, ASEAN member states reflected on their concerns in a joint communiqu\u00e9 released late on Thursday, united in their anxieties over the increasingly volatile landscape.\n\u201cWe underscored the importance of refraining from provocative actions and adhering to the principles enshrined in the United Nations Charter, the ASEAN Charter, the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation and the objectives and principles of the Southeast Asia Nuclear Weapon-Free Zone Treaty [SEANWFZ],\u201d the ministers stated in the outcome document.\nThe reference to ASEAN\u2019s basic norms and rules has been a recurring theme over the past week, as Jakarta sought to act on a perceived uptick in violations that has plunged the region into anxiety over the threat of conflict.\nAmong the issues ASEAN was negotiating were efforts to persuade nuclear weapon states (NWSs) to accede to a protocol of the SEANWFZ treaty, which calls for nuclear arms to be banned from the region.\nSimilarly, the bloc was also pushing the needle on the Code of Conduct (CoC) on the South China Sea, a document seeking to set up the rules of engagement in the region\u2019s most turbulent yet geopolitically strategic waters.\nAddressing major powers ahead of the 13th East Asia Summit (EAS) Foreign Ministers\u2019 Meeting on Friday, Indonesia\u2019s top diplomat Retno LP Marsudi made her message clear that major powers should sooner abide by ASEAN\u2019s rules and norms.\n\u201cThis is no time, I repeat, no time for vague actions. I will not cushion what I am conveying today. The Indo-Pacific is at a critical juncture. [It] must not become another battleground,\u201d she asserted.\nYet after a week of intense diplomacy, ASEAN\u2019s key partners on Friday only responded with modest pledges and with scant indication that they would soon commit to much-needed action to soothe anxieties in Southeast Asia.\nForeign Secretary James Cleverley of the United Kingdom, one of the five recognized NWSs, told\nThe Jakarta Post\nthat London would \u201clook\u201d into signing up to the SEANWFZ but made no further promises.\n\u201cI can\u2019t put a timeline on it, but this is something we are looking at in coordination with others. We recognize how important it is,\u201d Cleverley said in an interview on Friday.\nSimilarly, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken also made no promises when asked about his country\u2019s intention to accede to the 1995 treaty, even though the nuclear-armed US has been bolstering its military presence in the region.\n\u201cWith regard to the SEANWFZ treaty, [...] we very much appreciate ASEAN\u2019s leadership on this issue, and we very much look forward to continuing and in fact intensifying our consultation with ASEAN,\u201d Blinken told a press briefing in Jakarta late on Friday.\nThe remaining recognized NWSs, China, France and Russia have yet to make any statements.\nOn negotiations for the CoC, guidelines for speeding up the negotiation process were adopted on Thursday, with senior Chinese diplomat Wang Yi leading the forum alongside Minister Retno. It remains unclear when an effective and substantive CoC will materialize.\nMeanwhile, Indonesia had little to show for its intense \u201cquiet diplomacy\u201d on the Myanmar coup crisis, with ASEAN\u2019s peace plan, the Five-Point Consensus, to be put up for review, Minister Retno said in her closing press conference on Friday evening.\nHalf-hearted nodding\nWith the AMM results leaving much to be desired, ASEAN analysts are divided on the success or failures of this year\u2019s proceedings, saying that any momentum gained must be acknowledged but monitored closely for further development.\n\u201cASEAN is starting to show its stripes against NWSs, firmly asserting its stance with the SEANWFZ treaty. I\u2019m not too sure whether ASEAN has the capacity to push these countries, but at least there\u2019s space for dialogue,\u201d Ahmar Rizky Umar, an international relations expert from the University of Queensland told the\nPost\non Friday.\nMeanwhile, South China Sea expert from Gadjah Mada University, I Made Andi Arsana, argued that while the recent pact to expedite the CoC talks should be celebrated as a \u201csuccess\u201d, praise should be held until the momentum has been shown to be a means to an end, not an end in itself.\nThe results of this week\u2019s AMM will be followed with the submission of ministerial recommendations to ASEAN\u2019s leaders, who will convene in September to finally make decisions.

(Reuters /Tingshu Wang)\nU\nS Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said on Saturday that she and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng agreed to launch exchanges on \"balanced\" economic growth, an effort to address US concerns about China's excess manufacturing capacity.\nAfter two days of economic talks in China's southern export hub of Guangzhou, Yellen said she and He also agreed to start a forum to cooperate on anti-money laundering efforts in their respective financial systems.\nThe exchanges \"will facilitate a discussion around macroeconomic imbalances, including their connection to overcapacity, and I intend to use the opportunity to advocate for a level playing field for American workers and firms,\" Yellen said in a statement released at the conclusion of the talks.\nShe characterised four and a half hours of discussions with He on Saturday as productive and frank.\nComing into her four-day visit to China, her top priority was to persuade Chinese officials to rein in excess production capacity for electric vehicles (EVs), solar panels and other clean energy technology that threaten competing firms in the US and other countries.\nThe Biden administration is facing growing calls from US lawmakers to increase tariffs on Chinese EVs to protect US producers.\nProspects\nEvery Monday\nWith exclusive interviews and in-depth coverage of the region's most pressing business issues, \"Prospects\" is the go-to source for staying ahead of the curve in Indonesia's rapidly evolving business landscape.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nChinese state media pushed back on her excess capacity arguments, calling them a \"pretext\" for protectionist US policies and \"fear-mongering.\"\nNO TARIFF THREAT\nYellen did not threaten to raise tariffs or impose other trade barriers if China failed to curb state support that has expanded production of EVs, solar panels and other clean energy products far beyond domestic demand, a senior US Treasury official said.\n\"I think the Chinese realise how concerned we are about the implications of their industrial strategy, for the United States, for the potential to flood our markets with exports that make it difficult for American firms to compete\" Yellen said. \"And then other countries have the same concern.\"\nShe said the forum would provide a \"structured\" way to discuss a complicated issue but that it would take some time to resolve.\n\"It's going to be critical to our bilateral relationship going forward and to China's relationship with other countries that are important,\" she added.\nShe added Chinese officials were \"more confident\" about the world's second-biggest economy after putting in place policies to address issues in the property sector and on local government debt.\nChina's Xinhua news agency said in a statement that the discussions between He and Yellen were \"candid, pragmatic and constructive\", confirming both parties had agreed to further discuss balanced growth and financial stability.\nBeijing also expressed serious concerns about US economic and trade restrictions on China and made a full response to the production capacity issue during the talks, the statement said.\nThe US Treasury official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the balanced growth forum was first proposed in February during an economic working group meeting.\nWendy Cutler, a former US trade negotiator said the forum focused on overcapacity was a positive development, but there was a danger that it could \"turn into a stalling tactic\" by Beijing to avoid needed actions to bring supply and demand back into balance.\nYellen also said she had warned Chinese firms faced \"significant consequences\" if they provided material support to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The Chinese side emphasised that their policy was not to provide such support and did not want this to be a bilateral issue.\n'PROTECTIONIST PRETEXT'\nXinhua criticised Yellen's stance late on Friday, saying that talking up \"Chinese overcapacity\" in the clean energy sector created a pretext for protectionist policies to shield US companies.\nIn an editorial on Saturday, Xinhua said suppressing China's EV-related industries would not help the US grow its own, adding that it hoped more headway could be made during Yellen's visit to break down barriers hindering mutually beneficial cooperation.\nWhile Treasury does not expect a major shift in Chinese policy after Yellen's visit, US officials believe it was important to explain the economic risks that overinvestment in some sectors and weak consumer demand present to both China and its trading partners.\nYellen said on Friday her trip was partly aimed at cementing US-China ties to \"withstand shocks and challenging circumstances.\"\nYellen will continue her discussions with Chinese officials on Monday in Beijing, where she is to meet officials including Premier Li Qiang, Finance Minister Lan Foan and People's Bank of China Governor Pan Gongsheng.\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Article\nChina targets Nvidia with antitrust probe, escalates US chip tensions\nFord to make EV investment in Indonesia in 2025: Ministry\nTrump taps Jamieson Greer as US trade representative as ramps up tariff plans\nActivists protest rejection of dog and cat meat trade ban\nMinistry prepares trade remedies to brace for imports\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get \u2018closer to the people\u2019: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nMore in Business\nView more\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nTech\nMinister says Apple 'losing out' by dragging its feet on $1b investment\nRegulations\nMinistry inks collab with army, police on food security\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo\u2019s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia to evacuate more citizens from Syria\nEntertainment\n'Astro Bot' wins highest award at Oscars of video games\nPolitics\nIndonesia to pardon tens of thousands including Papua activists\nAcademia\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election",

(Reuters/Adrian Portugal)\nC\nhina's ambition to dominate the South China Sea (SCS) is suspected to be part of its strategic agenda to become the world's top nation in place of the United States, which is beginning to decline.\nBy controlling the strategic maritime region, China will subsequently control the Andaman Sea in the Indian Ocean, provided that construction is realized on the Kra Canal in Thailand, financed by China and equipped with Chinese technology.\nPresident Xi Jinping initiated in 2013 the 21\nst\nCentury Maritime Silk Road, a maritime route from the SCS connecting Southeast Asia to Central Asia, the Middle East, Europe and Africa that is significant to China achieving its grand dream of becoming a superpower. This action agenda is being carried out by building connectivity facilities, establishing economic, industrial maritime security and maritime cultural cooperation with the coastal countries along the route.\nIn such a context, China's resolve to make the SCS its territorial waters is intertwined with its ambitions as a major world power, because the sea is the gateway to the world's maritime trade from the western Pacific Ocean to the Indian Ocean, and then on to the Middle East, Africa and Europe.\nBeijing has consistently claimed that 90 percent of the SCS is Chinese territory, arguing that it has historically been its traditional fishing grounds. This claim was crowned in 1947 by creating the \"nine-dash line\" without regard to the 2016 decision by the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague, which rejected China's claim as contrary to the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).\nChina has also consistently ignored the protests of other claimant countries. Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei Darussalam and Taiwan all oppose China's actions in the SCS, which have become increasingly aggressive year by year. In fact, since August 2023, China has expanded its nine-dash line into 10 by incorporating Taiwan\u2019s waters.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nChina has followed its firm stance in asserting its claim to the SCS by taking possession of Subi Reef, Fiery Cross Reef, Mischief Reef and Woody Island to turn them into military bases.
