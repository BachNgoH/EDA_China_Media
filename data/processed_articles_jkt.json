The most significant outcome of the meeting was the adoption of the resolution on further deepening comprehensive reform to advance Chinese modernization.\nAs President Xi Jinping pointed out, reform and opening up are an ongoing endeavor rather than a task to be completed. The resolution laid out more than 300 important reform tasks across the board and overall arrangements for both economic structural reform and reforms in other areas, which shall be completed by the time the People’s Republic of China celebrates its 80th anniversary in 2029.\nThe resolution sends a strong message to both domestic and international audiences that Chinese modernization has been advanced continuously through reform and opening up, and it will surely embrace broader horizons through this process.\nAs Chinese ambassador to ASEAN, I would emphasize that the resolution not only has a profound impact on the future of China, but also pools of vast opportunities for the development of ASEAN countries. It thus will open broader prospects for the China-ASEAN community’s shared future.\nFirst, China’s reform will help China and ASEAN achieve common development. During the past 33 years, the two parties have joined hands to pursue modernization.\nChina has been ASEAN’s largest trading partner for 15 consecutive years, while ASEAN has been China’s biggest trading partner for the last four years. Two-way trade increased by 10.5 percent year-on-year (yoy) in the first half of 2024. In 2023, China’s investment in ASEAN increased by 44.6 percent and two-way investment has accumulated to over US$380 billion.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nThe Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) projects such as the China-Laos Railway and the Whoosh Jakarta-Bandung High-Speed Railway have helped promote regional connectivity and economic development along the line. The successful and vibrant China-ASEAN relationship has brought tremendous tangible benefits to the 2 billion people in the region.\nLooking into the future, China will leverage the strengths of its enormous market to enhance its capacity for opening up while expanding international cooperation and developing new institutions for a higher-standard open economy. This will inject more positive momentum into the development of our region and beyond.\nAccording to an International Monetary Fund study, a 1 percent increase in China’s gross domestic product growth would result in an average of 0.3 percent increase in growth for other economies. ASEAN, as China’s closest neighbor and major partner, could benefit even more.\nCurrently, China and ASEAN are negotiating the upgraded Free Trade Agreement 3.0. With the new trade arrangement, more and more products from ASEAN countries are to enter the Chinese market. This will also contribute to the development and prosperity of ASEAN and the well-being of its people.\nSecond, China’s further reform and opening up will inject new impetus to China-ASEAN relations. The resolution outlines plans for fostering new quality productive forces, nurturing new areas for international cooperation, including next-generation information technology, artificial intelligence, aviation and aerospace, new energy, new materials, high-end equipment, biomedicine and quantum technology.\nASEAN is drafting the ASEAN Community Vision 2045 and its strategic plans, and making great efforts in developing the digital economy, green economy and blue economy, as well as other emerging industries. With more and more confluence of interests, China and ASEAN can align their strategies to explore more potential cooperation in the future.\nChina-ASEAN cooperation on clean energy has continued to expand in recent years. Chinese brands account for 67 percent of electric vehicles sold in ASEAN, contributing to the energy transition in our region.\nAs China and ASEAN forge closer economic, trade and investment relations, more local communities in ASEAN countries will enjoy bigger development opportunities. These multiple economic and social effects will further consolidate the base of China-ASEAN relations. China stands ready to explore more cutting-edge growth drivers and mutually beneficial cooperation with ASEAN countries.\nThird, China’s further reform and opening up will make more contributions to regional peace, stability and prosperity. The resolution emphasizes that China remains firm in pursuing an independent foreign policy of peace and is dedicated to promoting a community with a shared future for mankind.\nChina stays committed to fully implementing the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative and the Global Civilization Initiative, and calls for an equal and orderly multipolar world and universally beneficial and inclusive economic globalization. China will continue to implement the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) in a high-quality manner and promote regional economic integration. China will continue to unleash the opportunities of BRI cooperation to further enhance regional connectivity.\nChinese modernization means peaceful development. China strives for openness, inclusiveness and win-win cooperation in promoting its relations with other countries.\nChina will continue to firmly support ASEAN centrality and contribute to ASEAN-centered regional cooperation and work hand in hand with ASEAN countries to build a closer China-ASEAN community with a shared future to realize the Asian dream of lasting peace and common modernization.\n***\nThe writer is Chinese ambassador to ASEAN\n.\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nRelated Articles\nAssad's fall in Syria exposes limits of China's Middle East diplomacy\nXi says trade war with US will have 'no winners'\nIndonesia women's team reaches first-ever AFF Cup final\nUnraveling the complexities of human security in Papua\nThe future of primary and secondary education under new minister\nRelated Article\nAssad's fall in Syria exposes limits of China's Middle East diplomacy\nXi says trade war with US will have 'no winners'\nIndonesia women's team reaches first-ever AFF Cup final\nUnraveling the complexities of human security in Papua\nThe future of primary and secondary education under new minister\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nMore in Opinion\nView more\nAcademia\nThe bottom-up wave of democratic rejuvenation\nAcademia\nPolice brutality: Fundamental problems in the institution\nAcademia\nFree trade deals increase Indonesian imports more than exports\nHighlight\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEditorial\nNarrow margin\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nThe Latest\nView more\nEconomy\nRI identifies 29 potential nuclear power plant sites\nEconomy\nChinese authorities are considering a weaker yuan as Trump trade risks loom, sources say\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia commences evacuation of 37 citizens in Damascus\nTech\nUS finalizes $6.1 billion Micron chip-making subsidy\nArchipelago\nTwo foreign visitors killed in tree collapse in Monkey Forest\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEconomy\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources\nRegulations\nBullion bank to launch in first half of next year, Airlangga says"

The past 30 years, though a short stretch of history, have been a glorious chapter highlighted by mutual friendship and cooperation.\nEvolving from a dialogue partnership to a strategic partnership, China and ASEAN are about to embrace a comprehensive strategic partnership that is already the most dynamic, substantive and influential in the entire region.\nOver the past three decades, China and ASEAN have deepened strategic mutual trust and enhanced good neighborliness. Leaders of the two sides have maintained close communication through multiple means. In recent years, Chinese President Xi Jinping has visited the 10 ASEAN member states and has met with leaders of ASEAN countries many times, steering the course of China-ASEAN relations.\nStrategic communication on major issues between the two sides has been conducted in a timely manner through the multi-level dialogue mechanism, including between top leaders, ministers and senior officials.\nWith our shared commitment to multilateralism, China and ASEAN jointly uphold the ASEAN-centered regional architecture that is open and inclusive. Together, we have safeguarded regional peace and stability and properly managed our differences on the South China Sea issue through dialogue and consultation.\nOver the past 30 years, China and ASEAN have offered each other much-needed support in trying times. The two have worked in concert to tide over one crisis after another, such as the 1997 Asian financial crisis, the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome outbreak, the 2004 bird flu epidemic and the 2008 global financial crisis.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nSince the COVID-19 pandemic struck, we have done our utmost to render assistance to each other.

How to make the world a better place? We need to, first and foremost, understand where we are right now.\nPresident Xi Jinping once quoted Charles Dickens as saying, \"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.\"\nIncreasing wealth and advancing technology take human civilization to a historic high. But the harsh reality is that humanity is also in the midst of daunting challenges and risks.\nGlobal growth is sluggish. Geopolitical conflicts are flaring up. A Cold War mentality and power politics still haunts us. Climate change, food insecurity, refugee crises, major infectious diseases – these are all serious challenges that we must face together.\nWe also see tragedies in Gaza and Ukraine. What is wrong with this world? What kind of world should we build? How to build such a world?\nAs a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council and a responsible major country, China's answer is to build a community with a shared future for mankind.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nIt was pointed out at the Central Conference on Work Relating to Foreign Affairs at the end of 2023 in Beijing that building a community with a shared future for mankind was a noble goal of our major-country diplomacy with Chinese characteristics for the new era.\nChina calls for a community with a shared future for mankind. We aim to build an open, inclusive, clean and beautiful world of lasting peace, universal security and shared prosperity.\nThe pathway is through promoting global governance that features extensive consultation and joint contribution for shared benefits, for a new form of international relations. This is neither the old thinking of confrontation and alliance, nor the old path of colonization and hegemony.\nEven less, the dead end of compromise under oppression. On the contrary, this is the gateway to peaceful development.\nWe the Chinese people always support world peace for all. This is also in line with the spirit of the Asia-Africa Conference 60 years ago in Bandung, West Java. China never pursues development at the cost of others. A zero-sum game is never our choice.\nWe have never resorted to invasion or colonization to become the second-largest economy. The Belt and Road Initiative (OBOR), the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative and the Global Civilization Initiative proposed by President Xi resonate well with the international community.\nChina welcomes all to join the cause toward a community with a shared future for mankind.\nChina calls for an equal and orderly multipolar world. As President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo stated at the Group of 20 Summit in Bali in November 2022, peace and stability are important for regional and global development.\nAs major developing countries, China and Indonesia share common goals. How to maintain peace and stability and protect every individual, every company and every country?\nChina's solution is to build an equal and orderly multipolar world, in which all countries, regardless of size, are treated as equals. Hegemonism and power politics are rejected and democracy is truly promoted in international relations.\nThe purposes and principles of the UN Charter must be observed by all, the generally universally recognized, basic norms governing international relations must be upheld by all, and true multilateralism must be practiced by all.\nChina calls for a universally beneficial and inclusive economic globalization. This is especially important for the Asia-Pacific, the most dynamic place full of economic potential.\nA universally beneficial and inclusive economic globalization is one that opposes all forms of unilateralism, protectionism and decoupling, firmly promotes trade and investment liberalization and facilitation and makes economic globalization more open, inclusive, balanced and beneficial to all.\nFor China, Indonesia and other regional countries, the implementation of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) and mutually beneficial cooperation in supply chains are all part of our efforts for a universally beneficial and inclusive economic globalization.\nAn equal and orderly multipolar world, a universally beneficial and inclusive economic globalization, and greater democracy in international relations are the features of a better world.\nCurrently, China, together with Indonesia and an increasing number of friendly countries, are building a community-shared future. The Jakarta-Bandung high-speed train (Whoosh), the Suramadu Bridge, timely vaccine assistance from China, popular electric vehicles and Mobile Legends, are all real images of the China-Indonesia community of a shared future.\nPresident Xi quoted an Indonesian proverb during the G20 Bali Summit, \"Sugarcane and lemongrass grow in dense clumps.\" China is ready to work with Indonesia to implement the important consensus reached by our two presidents to build the China-Indonesia community with a shared future, strengthen exchanges and cooperation in all fields, promote peace, stability, development and prosperity for China, Indonesia, the region and the world and deliver a community with a shared future for mankind.\n***\nThe writer is Chinese ambassador to Indonesia.\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nRelated Articles\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nMore than 100 Rohingya refugees rescued off Indonesia: UN\nBeyond BRICS rhetoric\nRevisiting Indonesia’s surprising BRICS plan\nThe main economic challenges for Prabowo’s government\nRelated Article\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nMore than 100 Rohingya refugees rescued off Indonesia: UN\nBeyond BRICS rhetoric\nRevisiting Indonesia’s surprising BRICS plan\nThe main economic challenges for Prabowo’s government\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nMore in Opinion\nView more\nAcademia\nThe bottom-up wave of democratic rejuvenation\nAcademia\nPolice brutality: Fundamental problems in the institution\nAcademia\nFree trade deals increase Indonesian imports more than exports\nHighlight\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEditorial\nNarrow margin\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nThe Latest\nView more\nEconomy\nRI identifies 29 potential nuclear power plant sites\nEconomy\nChinese authorities are considering a weaker yuan as Trump trade risks loom, sources say\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia commences evacuation of 37 citizens in Damascus\nTech\nUS finalizes $6.1 billion Micron chip-making subsidy\nArchipelago\nTwo foreign visitors killed in tree collapse in Monkey Forest\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEconomy\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources\nRegulations\nBullion bank to launch in first half of next year, Airlangga says"

(Reuters/Willy Kurniawan)\nTime rolls on just like the flow of water. On Feb. 22, 2022, I came to the “nation of archipelago” as the Chinese ambassador to Indonesia on a glorious mission entrusted by my government. In the blink of an eye, the time has come for me to bid farewell.\nIn the past two years, I traveled around Java, and set foot on the islands of Sumatra, Kalimantan, Sulawesi, Bali and West and East Nusa Tenggara. From the sapphire-blue sky and sea of Bali to the emerald-green mountain and water of Lake Toba, from the Komodo dragon to the orangutan, from the Mahayana reliefs of Borobudur to the statue of Zheng He in Semarang, I have been deeply impressed by Indonesia’s wonderful scenery, diverse and inclusive culture, kind-hearted and hospitable people and vibrant society.\nThe past two years have been rewarding. Together with Indonesian friends from all walks of life, I have made efforts to implement the important consensus reached by Chinese and Indonesian leaders to deepen cooperation in development strategy, promote practical cooperation and expand exchanges and mutual learning.\nChina-Indonesia relations have made great strides forward, delivering fruitful outcomes from this cooperation. Both important developing countries and emerging economies, our two countries share similar goals, uphold mutual respect and strive for mutual benefit from each other’s comparative strengths.\nWe work hand in hand on the path toward modernization and bring tangible benefits to our two peoples.

In the past two years, President Xi Jinping made the first overseas visit to Indonesia after the 20th Communist Party of China (CPC) National Congress. President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo visited China three times. President-elect\nPrabowo Subianto\nmade his first visit to China soon after the election.\nI am pleased to see that our two presidents have charted the course of jointly building the China-Indonesia community with a shared future, and reached a new important consensus on turning the vision into a reality. Our two sides make full use of high-level dialogue and cooperation mechanism to promote practical cooperation in all areas. The 2+2 ministerial dialogue mechanism is in place and will set to inject new momentum into our Comprehensive Strategic Partnership.\nI am pleased to see that our two countries have become the pacesetters of successful Belt and Road cooperation based on the principle of designing together, building together and benefiting together. The Jakarta-Bandung High-Speed Rail (Whoosh) makes Indonesia the only country besides China to have a 350-kilometer/hour railway.\nWhoosh not only shortens the&nbsp;travel time, but also helps upgrade the industrial structure and empower economic development along the route. The Regional Comprehensive Economic Corridor and the “Two Countries, Twin Parks” move forward steadily and are expected to become new flagship projects of our Belt and Road cooperation.\nI am pleased to see that our two-way trade is over US$100 billion every year. China has been Indonesia’s largest trading partner for 11 consecutive years and among Indonesia’s top three sources of foreign investment for eight years in a row. Our industrial and supply chain cooperation develops by leaps and bounds, a success for both sides.\nI am pleased to see the increasing number of flights and people-to-people exchanges between the two countries in the post-COVID era. Indonesian students return to campus in China. The performance of the folk music ensemble and Xinjiang art troupe from China amazed Indonesian friends. Delegations of Indonesian religious communities paid visits to China. Chinese language training courses are now open in Istiqlal Mosque.\nThe China-Indonesia joint scientific expedition set Indonesia’s deepest dive record. Indonesia is one of the first destinations for China to resume outbound group tours after the pandemic. In 2023, 707,000 Chinese tourists came to Indonesia to enjoy sea views, volcano trekking and delicious food.\nI am pleased to see that our two countries work together closely on international and regional issues with similar positions. In the past two years, Indonesia successfully hosted the Group of 20 Bali Summit and Leaders’ Meetings on East Asia Cooperation as the chair of the G20 and ASEAN. China fully supported Indonesia in fulfilling its duties. China appreciates Indonesia’s support for the Global Development Initiative and its positive response to the Global Security Initiative and Global Civilization Initiative, and is ready to work with Indonesia to take the initiatives forward.\nChanges in the world, of our times and of historical significance are unfolding like never before, and the world has entered a new period of turbulence and transformation. Yet the overall direction of human development and progress will not change, the overall dynamics of world history moving forward amid twists and turns will not change and the overall trend toward a shared future for the international community will not change.\nAs long as China and Indonesia focus on building the community with a shared future, continue to promote high-quality Belt and Road cooperation, call for an equal and orderly multi-polar world and universally beneficial and inclusive economic globalization, respond to global challenges together and strive to achieve common prosperity, the bilateral relations will surely get better day by day. Our respective development goals will surely be achieved and we will surely have an even brighter future.\nAs an Indonesian proverb goes, “Money is easy to get, but friends are hard to find.” I am glad that in the past two years, I have had the opportunity to get to know friends from the Indonesian government, political parties, parliament, business, religious and overseas Chinese communities, think tanks and media, other diplomatic missions in Indonesia and Chinese entrepreneurs, press and teachers. Thank you all for your valuable contributions to China-Indonesia relations and strong support for the work of the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia, and myself in particular.\nWords are never enough for bidding farewell. I will start a new journey with beautiful memories and deep friendships from Indonesia. And I will continue to follow the development of China-Indonesia relations and be an envoy of friendship between our two countries.\nMay China and Indonesia enjoy prosperity and the people’s happiness. May China-Indonesia relations reach greater heights. May all our Indonesian friends enjoy good health.\n***\nThe writer is Chinese ambassador to Indonesia.\n&nbsp;\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nRelated Articles\nIndonesia’s tourist sector: A new era of innovation and growth\nPhilippines agrees to transfer proposal for prisoner Mary Jane Veloso\nIndonesia should think twice about joining BRICS and OECD\nChina to curbs exports of key chipmaking components to US\nSemarang police shoot student allegedly involved in gang brawl\nRelated Article\nIndonesia’s tourist sector: A new era of innovation and growth\nPhilippines agrees to transfer proposal for prisoner Mary Jane Veloso\nIndonesia should think twice about joining BRICS and OECD\nChina to curbs exports of key chipmaking components to US\nSemarang police shoot student allegedly involved in gang brawl\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nMore in Opinion\nView more\nAcademia\nThe bottom-up wave of democratic rejuvenation\nAcademia\nPolice brutality: Fundamental problems in the institution\nAcademia\nFree trade deals increase Indonesian imports more than exports\nHighlight\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEditorial\nNarrow margin\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nThe Latest\nView more\nTech\nUS finalizes $6.1 billion Micron chip-making subsidy\nArchipelago\nTwo foreign visitors killed in tree collapse in Monkey Forest\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEconomy\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources\nRegulations\nBullion bank to launch in first half of next year, Airlangga says\nMiddle East and Africa\nAirline pilots, crews voice concerns about Middle East routes\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nRegulations\nEY worker's death spotlights India's unprotected white-collar labor"

The past 30 years, though a short stretch of history, have been a glorious chapter highlighted by mutual friendship and cooperation.\nEvolving from a dialogue partnership to a strategic partnership, China and ASEAN are about to embrace a comprehensive strategic partnership that is already the most dynamic, substantive and influential in the entire region.\nOver the past three decades, China and ASEAN have deepened strategic mutual trust and enhanced good neighborliness. Leaders of the two sides have maintained close communication through multiple means. In recent years, Chinese President Xi Jinping has visited the 10 ASEAN member states and has met with leaders of ASEAN countries many times, steering the course of China-ASEAN relations.\nStrategic communication on major issues between the two sides has been conducted in a timely manner through the multi-level dialogue mechanism, including between top leaders, ministers and senior officials.\nWith our shared commitment to multilateralism, China and ASEAN jointly uphold the ASEAN-centered regional architecture that is open and inclusive. Together, we have safeguarded regional peace and stability and properly managed our differences on the South China Sea issue through dialogue and consultation.\nOver the past 30 years, China and ASEAN have offered each other much-needed support in trying times. The two have worked in concert to tide over one crisis after another, such as the 1997 Asian financial crisis, the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome outbreak, the 2004 bird flu epidemic and the 2008 global financial crisis.\nSince the COVID-19 pandemic struck, we have done our utmost to render assistance to each other. Urgently needed anti-COVID materials have been supplied in an uninterrupted manner, experience in prevention and control has been shared, and cooperation has been enhanced in vaccine research and development, supply and production. China and ASEAN are proud to represent an exemplary model of international anti-COVID cooperation.\nOver the past 30 years, China and ASEAN have promoted development-oriented cooperation for our mutual benefit. Our two-way trade grew from US$8.36 billion in 1991 to $685.28 billion in 2020, and it totaled $630.5 billion in the first three quarters of this year. Last year, China and ASEAN became each other’s largest trading partner for the first time in history.\nThe 2-billion-strong combined population of China and ASEAN countries represent a huge consumer market and the largest free trade zone among developing countries. The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), among other trade arrangements, opens broad, new prospects for China-ASEAN economic and trade engagement.\nOver the past 30 years, China and ASEAN have drawn our peoples closer together. In 2019, 65 million people made mutual visits and nearly 4,500 weekly flights traveled between China and ASEAN countries. Exchange mechanisms have continued to expand in the fields of education, culture, tourism, youth, research and journalism. Despite the adverse impacts of the pandemic, our people-to-people exchanges on the cloud have been ever more robust.\nThe special summit to commemorate the 30th anniversary of ASEAN-China dialogue relations is to take place in a few days. It will be an important milestone in our relations to build on the past and plan for the future. Our top leaders are expected to further deepen political mutual trust, enhance cooperation and map our the way forward.\nIt is critical for China and ASEAN to seize the momentum, tap the full potential of our relations and build a closer China-ASEAN community with a shared future for the benefit of our 2 billion people in 11 countries. I believe priority could be given to the following four areas:\nFirst, jointly defeat the pandemic and boost the regional economy. Vaccine cooperation is of special significance, including accelerated efforts to build regional vaccine production and distribution centers in Southeast Asia. The COVID-19 pandemic will not be the last on the planet. To be well prepared in the future, efforts need to be made to enhance emergency response capacities through public health cooperation.\nIn the meantime, China and ASEAN need to go all in to promote comprehensive, regionwide post-COVID recovery and steer our region back onto a solid growth track, especially by keeping the industrial supply chains unclogged.\nSecond, foster new areas of growth in pursuit of common development. It is key for the two sides to improve regional connectivity by better synergizing development policies and advancing high-quality Belt and Road cooperation. China and ASEAN need to ensure the sound implementation of the upgraded China-ASEAN Free Trade Agreement and fully leverage RCEP, which will enter into force next year to shape an Asia-Pacific free trade area.\nInnovation-driven growth also deserves our increased endeavors, and new areas of cooperation might be explored in smart cities, e-commerce, artificial intelligence, new energy and technologies for environmental protection.\nThird, nurture closer people-to-people ties. Exchanges await expansion in culture, education, sports, women and youth, as well as exchanges for our media and think tanks. Mutual understanding between our younger generations is to be deepened further through flagship projects such as the ASEAN-China Young Leaders Scholarship, the ASEAN-China Short Video Contest, the ASEAN-China Media and Think Tank Forum. More could be done also to enhance mutual learning and nurture our shared\nEast Asian\nvalues.\nFourth, safeguard international justice through solidarity and coordination. It is of paramount importance for China and ASEAN to jointly safeguard the United Nations-centered international system and the basic norms governing international relations based on the principles and purposes of the UN Charter. We must join hands to champion the spirit of cooperation in\nEast Asia\nand multilateralism with Asian characteristics, oppose zero-sum games and hegemonic bullying and maintain a regional cooperation framework that is open and inclusive.\nAs friendly neighbors, China and ASEAN need to maintain communication at all levels and continue to support each other on issues concerning each other’s core interests. Differences shall continue to be managed through dialogue and consultation, which is an important way of deepening strategic mutual trust.\nAs an old Chinese poem goes, “The river is wide at full tide; a strong wind sends the sail surging forward.” I have full confidence that with our concerted efforts, the giant ship of China-ASEAN friendship and cooperation will sail ahead steadily and make greater contributions to peace, stability, development and prosperity of Asia.\nI look forward to another exciting 30 years of China-ASEAN relations.\n***\nThe writer is Chinese Ambassador to ASEAN.\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nRelated Articles\nAssad's fall in Syria exposes limits of China's Middle East diplomacy\nVietnam's soaring US trade surplus stokes new fears of tariffs\nIndonesia to attend ASEAN ministers’ meeting on Myanmar\nIndonesia should think twice about joining BRICS and OECD\nConfronting the climate crisis: Water as a lever for climate action\nRelated Article\nAssad's fall in Syria exposes limits of China's Middle East diplomacy\nVietnam's soaring US trade surplus stokes new fears of tariffs\nIndonesia to attend ASEAN ministers’ meeting on Myanmar\nIndonesia should think twice about joining BRICS and OECD\nConfronting the climate crisis: Water as a lever for climate action\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nMore in Paper\nView more\nOpinion\nAnalysis: Govt adopts mandatory B35 biodiesel program as CPO prices tumble\nBusiness\nGlobal chip crunch stunts Indonesia car sales recovery\nBusiness\nXL profit falls in Q3 as tower sale income dries\nHighlight\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEditorial\nNarrow margin\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nThe Latest\nView more\nTech\nUS finalizes $6.1 billion Micron chip-making subsidy\nArchipelago\nTwo foreign visitors killed in tree collapse in Monkey Forest\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEconomy\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources\nRegulations\nBullion bank to launch in first half of next year, Airlangga says\nMiddle East and Africa\nAirline pilots, crews voice concerns about Middle East routes\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nRegulations\nEY worker's death spotlights India's unprotected white-collar labor"

President Xi Jinping, President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo and other leaders of ASEAN countries delivered speeches at the opening ceremony, saying they looked forward to the bright future of China-ASEAN relations.\nChina and ASEAN countries, connected by the same mountains and rivers, are inseparable neighbors. In recent years, China and ASEAN enjoy deepening mutual trust, growing connectivity, robust business ties and closer people-to-people exchanges.\nThe China-ASEAN relationship has grown into the most successful and vibrant model for cooperation in the Asia-Pacific and an exemplary effort in building a community with a shared future for mankind.\nSince the start of COVID-19, China and ASEAN countries have taken the lead in conducting regional antiepidemic cooperation. We have actively shared our experience in COVID-19 response, ensured medical supplies, conducted joint research and development of vaccines, and kept the regional industrial and supply chains stable. We are at the forefront of global cooperation on pandemic response and economic recovery.\nDespite the severe global economic recession and sharp decline in trade, bilateral trade and investment between China and ASEAN continue to rise this year. In the first three quarters, China-ASEAN trade reached US$481.81 billion, up by 5 percent year-on-year, making ASEAN China’s largest trading partner.\nChina’s industry-wide foreign direct investment in ASEAN topped $10.72 billion, jumping 76.6 percent year-on-year. These figures speak volumes about the strong foundation and potential of our cooperation.\nIndonesia is the largest country in ASEAN. The development of China-Indonesia relations has played an important leading role in China-ASEAN relations. Since the start of the COVID-19, our two countries have worked together to overcome difficulties and achieved growth in bilateral relations despite the pandemic.\nPresident Xi and President Jokowi exchanged three phone calls, charting the course for bilateral cooperation on pandemic response and economic recovery. Signature cooperation projects such as the Jakarta-Bandung high-speed railway and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Corridors are making steady progress. Our two governments and peoples have supported each other to fight the pandemic.\nAs of now, enterprises from both countries are pushing ahead with cooperation on vaccine research and development, production and technological transfer, which will make Indonesia among the first countries to gain access to a COVID-19 vaccine and become a regional vaccine production center.\nFrom January to September this year, China remained Indonesia’s largest trading partner and second-largest investor. China’s imports from Indonesia has increased by 6.3 percent and investment to Indonesia grew by 79 percent.\nAt the end of last month, our two countries successfully held the China-Indonesia Coal Procurement Matchmaking Meeting where companies of both countries reached procurement agreements worth $1.467 billion. These fully demonstrate the great vitality and huge potential of China-Indonesia relations.\nThis year marks the 70\nth\nanniversary of diplomatic relations between China and Indonesia, and next year marks the 30\nth\nanniversary of China-ASEAN dialogue relations.\nLooking back, the development of China-Indonesia relations and China-ASEAN relations have made positive contribution to peace, stability and prosperity in the region and beyond. Looking to the future, our relations stand at a new historical starting point, ushering in the bright prospect of building a community with a shared future.\nTogether we should cherish the hard-won achievements and seize the historical opportunities in front of us. We welcome friendly exchanges and cooperation between respective countries and others.\nYet we should also be vigilant against any attempt to disrupt China’s ties with Indonesia and other ASEAN countries. China stands ready to continue working with Indonesia and other ASEAN countries to advance cooperation on pandemic response and economic recovery, resist any external interference, jointly maintain regional peace and stability, and work together to build a closer China-ASEAN community with a shared future.\n&nbsp;***\nThe writer is Chinese ambassador to Indonesia.\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nRelated Articles\nFree trade deals increase Indonesian imports more than exports\nAssad's fall in Syria exposes limits of China's Middle East diplomacy\nOECD warns of protectionism weeks before Trump return\nMalaysia urges Chinese firms to avoid using it to dodge US tariffs\nThe visible and the marginalized: Examining our rule of law\nRelated Article\nFree trade deals increase Indonesian imports more than exports\nAssad's fall in Syria exposes limits of China's Middle East diplomacy\nOECD warns of protectionism weeks before Trump return\nMalaysia urges Chinese firms to avoid using it to dodge US tariffs\nThe visible and the marginalized: Examining our rule of law\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nMore in Paper\nView more\nOpinion\nAnalysis: Govt adopts mandatory B35 biodiesel program as CPO prices tumble\nBusiness\nGlobal chip crunch stunts Indonesia car sales recovery\nBusiness\nXL profit falls in Q3 as tower sale income dries\nHighlight\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEditorial\nNarrow margin\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nThe Latest\nView more\nTech\nUS finalizes $6.1 billion Micron chip-making subsidy\nArchipelago\nTwo foreign visitors killed in tree collapse in Monkey Forest\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEconomy\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources\nRegulations\nBullion bank to launch in first half of next year, Airlangga says\nMiddle East and Africa\nAirline pilots, crews voice concerns about Middle East routes\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nRegulations\nEY worker's death spotlights India's unprotected white-collar labor"

(JP/Dhoni Setiawan)\nT\nhe beginning of the new decade was met with the outbreak of COVID-19. The battle against it has now come to a critical moment when negative and positive elements coexist and the window of containment is getting narrower. The future of mankind is, once again, tightly interlocked in the face of an epidemic.\nChina and ASEAN, as close neighbors, have been going through the test for two months. The even closer friendly bonds between our peoples will further energize the building of a closer China-ASEAN community with a shared future.\nChina and ASEAN have been leading the fight against COVID-19. As Chinese President Xi Jinping has said, China always puts people's lives and health first. Under the strong leadership of the Communist Party of China’s Central Committee with Comrade Xi at its core, comprehensive epidemic prevention and control deployment has been carried out immediately after the outbreak, including many unprecedented, creative measures.\nNotable progress has been brought about so far. The number of new confirmed cases in provinces other than Hubei has by and large stayed below 10 now, and the emergency response measures in many provinces have been cut from Level I to Level III. In Hubei, the number of new confirmed cases in cities other than Wuhan has now dropped to less than 10.\nWuhan is now at the most crucial stage of the battle. The number of its confirmed cases has plunged from over 1,000 in the first half of February to above 100 in recent days and is expected to continue its way straight downward to zero in the near future.\nChina has accumulated much experience in this fight that other countries may find helpful. China’s performance, greatly encouraging indeed, will significantly boost the confidence of other countries to fight and win. China’s efforts have not only safeguarded the health and safety of the Chinese people, but also contributed greatly to global public health security.\nThe Chinese government is taking coordinated measures to contain the epidemic and advance economic and social development. President Xi Jinping has stressed that the negative impact of the epidemic on China’s economy will be temporary and short-lived. The fundamentals sustaining sound economic growth have not changed and will not change.\nWith the country’s great resilience, robust domestic demand and strong industrial base, we have full confidence and capability in meeting this year’s targets for economic and social development and moving closer to our goals in the longer term.\nEpidemic prevention and control in ASEAN member states have also been remarkable. The situation in Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia and Indonesia has been put under effective control, and no more new cases were reported in Cambodia and the Philippines for more than two consecutive weeks.\nThe World Health Organization has highly commended the efforts of ASEAN countries. Some ASEAN members have adopted economic stimulus policies to minimize the negative impact of the epidemic.\nChina has provided ASEAN and the rest of the international community with timely updates on the epidemic in a spirit of openness and transparency. The special video conference of the ASEAN Plus Three (China, Japan and Republic of Korea) Senior Officials Meeting on Health Development was held on Feb. 3 to share information and good practices.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\nAs close neighbors, ASEAN member states rendered China timely and strong material and moral support. The heads of state or government or the foreign ministers of all ASEAN members extended to the Chinese government and people their sympathy, support and solidarity through phone calls, messages and visits. The Chairman’s\nStatement on ASEAN Collective Response to the Outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019\n, released on Feb. 15, expressed ASEAN’s firm support of China and emphasized the spirit of a cohesive and responsive ASEAN community in facing the challenge.\nOn Feb. 20, the Special ASEAN-China Foreign Ministers’ Meeting was held in Vientiane. As the first multilateral meeting on COVID-19, the event highlighted the tradition between China and ASEAN of standing side by side and helping each other in difficult times as well as our deep friendship formed in sharing weal and woe. The ministers reached an important consensus on the China-ASEAN joint response to the epidemic. They agreed to work together in this critical moment and set an example for global cooperation in combating the epidemic.\nIn 2013, President Xi proposed to build a closely-knit China-ASEAN community with a shared future during his visit to Indonesia. Over the years, China and ASEAN have never stopped working toward this goal.\nWe foster good neighborliness and strengthen political and strategic mutual trust. We pursue win-win cooperation for common development and shared prosperity. We firmly stand by the other’s side to prevail over risks and challenges.\nWe nurture close people-to-people ties based on our time-honored friendship. We champion openness and inclusiveness to build more diverse and harmonious societies, to name but a few. These unremitting efforts have ushered China-ASEAN relations into a new stage of all-round development.\nThe joint fight against COVID-19 has made China and ASEAN more aware of the importance and urgency of building a community with a shared future. The awareness itself will be a strong push to the growth of the ever-promising China-ASEAN relations.\nUnder the current circumstances, China and ASEAN still need to continue close cooperation in epidemic containment and public health, in order to defeat the epidemic as soon as possible and safeguard people’s health and well-being. In the meantime, it’s important for us to seize the opportunity and substantiate our major cooperation agenda with concrete initiatives for more visible benefits to the people.\nSuch progress will further materialize and expand our relations, foster enabling conditions for the upgrading of our relations at the much-expected 30th anniversary of our dialogue process in 2021 and inject fresh impetus to a closer China-ASEAN community with a shared future.\n***\nAmbassador of the People’s Republic of China to ASEAN\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nRelated Articles\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources\nAsa Ren, Health Ministry continue work on collecting biological samples\nXi says trade war with US will have 'no winners'\nIndonesia to attend ASEAN ministers’ meeting on Myanmar\nVietnam to build $67 billion high-speed railway\nRelated Article\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources\nAsa Ren, Health Ministry continue work on collecting biological samples\nXi says trade war with US will have 'no winners'\nIndonesia to attend ASEAN ministers’ meeting on Myanmar\nVietnam to build $67 billion high-speed railway\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nMore in Academia\nView more\nAcademia\nThe bottom-up wave of democratic rejuvenation\nAcademia\nPolice brutality: Fundamental problems in the institution\nAcademia\nFree trade deals increase Indonesian imports more than exports\nHighlight\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEditorial\nNarrow margin\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nThe Latest\nView more\nTech\nUS finalizes $6.1 billion Micron chip-making subsidy\nArchipelago\nTwo foreign visitors killed in tree collapse in Monkey Forest\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEconomy\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources\nRegulations\nBullion bank to launch in first half of next year, Airlangga says\nMiddle East and Africa\nAirline pilots, crews voice concerns about Middle East routes\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nRegulations\nEY worker's death spotlights India's unprotected white-collar labor"

(Reuters/Willy Kurniawan)\nAt the invitation of President Xi Jinping, Indonesian President\nPrabowo Subianto\nwill begin a state visit to China tomorrow. Following his first overseas visit to China last April after the election, President Prabowo also chose China as the destination for his first visit after inauguration.\nThese two \"firsts\" reflect President Prabowo's friendship with China, and fully demonstrate the depth of the China-Indonesia Comprehensive Strategic Partnership. We hope and believe that this visit will further accelerate the fast-growing bilateral relations, upgrade practical cooperation in all fields and start a new journey toward the China-Indonesia community with a shared future.\nOver the past decade, our two presidents exchanged visits multiple times, having more than 10 meetings and phone calls. During President Prabowo’s visit to China last April, President Xi and President Prabowo reached important consensus on deepening all-round strategic cooperation and building a China-Indonesia community with a shared future with regional and global influence.\nThe Chinese Embassy in Indonesia and the Indonesian team are working hard to implement the consensus. During this upcoming visit, President Xi will meet with President Prabowo to exchange views on significant issues regarding China-Indonesia relations.\nWe will work with the Indonesian side to implement the important consensus, continue to support each other firmly on issues related to our core interests and major concerns, elevate our comprehensive strategic partnership to new heights and make the building the China-Indonesia community with a shared future more substantive.\nIndonesia, where the “21st Century Maritime Silk Road” was raised, has left a distinctive \"Indonesian mark\" on the Belt and Road Initiative.

Both sides have made continuous progress in cooperation in minerals, industrial parks, digital economy, photovoltaic and electric vehicles (EVs).\nPeople-to-people exchanges are also a highlight. In 2023, nearly 790,000 Chinese tourists visited Indonesia, exploring volcanoes, islands and local cuisines. In the first half of 2024, the number reached around 570,000, making China one of Indonesia’s most significant tourist source countries.\nWe look forward to reaching new important consensus on practical cooperation across various fields, creating more highlights out of win-win cooperation and contributing to Indonesia’s economic and social development and the well-being of its people, thus enhancing the sense of gaining of both peoples in the China-Indonesia community with a shared future.\nAs key members of the Global South and emerging economies, China and Indonesia firmly uphold the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and promote the Bandung Spirit of unity, friendship and cooperation set forth in the 1955 Asia-Africa Conference.\nWe work closely together in international and regional affairs, advancing China-ASEAN cooperation, maintaining peace and stability in the South China Sea, supporting the Palestinian national liberation cause and defending the common interests of the Global South. Such cooperation highlights the nature of the pursuit of peace, development, fairness and justice in our bilateral relations.\nWe look forward to reaching new consensus on closer multilateral coordination, maintaining ASEAN centrality and strengthening coordination and cooperation in the United Nations, BRICS, the Group of 20, Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) and other multilateral fora, so as to jointly advance global governance reforms, showcase the responsibility of major developing nations and highlight the global significance of the China-Indonesia community with a shared future.\nOver the years, China’s growth rate has been among the top in major economies, contributing about 30 percent global growth. In the first three quarters of 2024, China’s economy grew by 4.8 percent.\nWe continue to expand high-level opening-up, being the world’s second-largest recipient of foreign investment for three consecutive years. We are shortening the negative list for foreign investment and have eliminated all restrictions on foreign investment in the manufacturing sector.\nChina is accelerating technological innovation and green transformation, ranking 11th in the 2024 global innovation index. Its wind and solar energy products help reduce global emissions by 2.83 billion tonnes.\nChina is also actively expanding its network of high-standard free trade areas globally, signing 22 free trade agreements with 29 countries and regions. Trade with over 160 countries and regions, including Indonesia, keeps growing.\nChina's economy is scaling new heights and is full of potential. China will contribute more certainty and positive energy to the steady development of global economy, providing new opportunities for the development of all countries.\nThe China-Indonesia relationship has already embarked on a new journey. The blueprint is drawn, and the action is imminent. We are confident that, under the strategic guidance of our two presidents, the ship of China-Indonesia friendship will overcome all challenges and sail forward.\n***\nThe writer is Chinese ambassador to Indonesia.\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nRelated Articles\nFree trade deals increase Indonesian imports more than exports\nPresident Prabowo should make Indonesia a global champion of democracy\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nIndonesia should think twice about joining BRICS and OECD\nEurope’s economy is stalling out\nRelated Article\nFree trade deals increase Indonesian imports more than exports\nPresident Prabowo should make Indonesia a global champion of democracy\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nIndonesia should think twice about joining BRICS and OECD\nEurope’s economy is stalling out\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nMore in Opinion\nView more\nAcademia\nThe bottom-up wave of democratic rejuvenation\nAcademia\nPolice brutality: Fundamental problems in the institution\nAcademia\nFree trade deals increase Indonesian imports more than exports\nHighlight\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEditorial\nNarrow margin\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nThe Latest\nView more\nEconomy\nRI identifies 29 potential nuclear power plant sites\nEconomy\nChinese authorities are considering a weaker yuan as Trump trade risks loom, sources say\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia commences evacuation of 37 citizens in Damascus\nTech\nUS finalizes $6.1 billion Micron chip-making subsidy\nArchipelago\nTwo foreign visitors killed in tree collapse in Monkey Forest\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEconomy\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources\nRegulations\nBullion bank to launch in first half of next year, Airlangga says"

(AFP/Andry Denisah)\nI\nn 2013, President Xi Jinping, in a speech to Indonesia's parliament, announced an initiative for China to work with ASEAN countries for a 21st Century Maritime Silk Road to build together a closer China-ASEAN community with a shared future.\nFor a decade, China and ASEAN have enjoyed growing connectivity, deepening economic integration and robust business ties.\nSince 2020, ASEAN has surpassed the European Union to become China's largest trading partner, marking the official formation of a new regional economic and trade cooperation pattern in which China and ASEAN are each other's largest trading partners. Furthermore, China is the second highest contributor of foreign direct investment (FDI) to Indonesia.\nIn 2022, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) came into effect, which presented China a year-on-year trade increase of 15 percent with ASEAN.\nAs the two economies partnership continues to deepen, beyond trade, we expect to see China’s growing footprint in ASEAN through FDI, planting seeds for growth in China and ASEAN’s share future.\nChina and ASEAN, as two of the world’s fastest growing regions, are highly complementary of industrial structures.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nSoutheast Asia enjoys strong manufacturing and production capacity, rising and young domestic consumer population, as well as increasing urbanization. The region’s growing trade and capital flows, continuing digital transformation, and greater focus on sustainability are creating tremendous opportunities.\nChina’s modern economy was built on the strength of a solid and often low-tech manufacturing sector, making it the world’s single largest manufacturer today. As China continues to develop and move up the value chain – toward producing more high-tech manufactures and services and investing in more R&amp;D – it is likely that some of the country’s lower-tech, labor intensive manufacturing will be ‘up for grabs.\nIt is expected that ASEAN will emerge as the third pillar of Asian growth alongside China and India. The changing landscape of China’s manufacturing sector will present significant opportunities for ASEAN to capture some of China’s manufacturing, and to become a major source of consumption for the world.\nThe garment and textile industry is the most obvious candidate for moving production out of China to other Asian countries. There are also examples of intermediate-input and other tech manufacturing leaving China with countries like Vietnam, Thailand and Indonesia picking up electronics work.\nAnd as more companies seek geographic diversification and adopt the “China+1” strategy, Southeast Asia will continue to gain market share – as well as a greater slice of global foreign direct investment as the center of gravity of global manufacturing continues to shift.\nFDI flows into ASEAN as a percentage of total world flows rose to a record high of 11 percent in 2021, almost on par with China (12 percent). And China has become the joint largest source country for FDI into ASEAN (not counting intra-ASEAN) in 2021, on par with Japan. While the process was partially disrupted by the pandemic, after the re-opening, China’s investment push into ASEAN will continue to thrive.\nMost of mainland China’s FDI projects in ASEAN in 2022 fall into sectors where recipient countries have a competitive advantage. Over the years, China has been investing heavily in ASEAN’s booming manufacturing sector, ranging from the EV supply chain in Indonesia and Thailand, to consumer electronics in Vietnam, as well as Singapore’s promising pharmaceuticals.\nFor example, Chinese investment has been key in facilitating Indonesia’s nickel smelter boom, a key input for producing EV batteries. China-based CATL signed an agreement with Indonesia’s state-owned enterprises PT Antam and PT Industri Baterai Indonesia (IBI) to jointly develop an almost US$6 billion mining-to-batteries ecosystem (Bloomberg, April 2022).\nIndonesia is not the only candidate for China’s FID along the EV supply chain. BYD, China’s top EV producer, is planning to build a production center in Thailand, with a capacity of production of 150,000 EVs per annum. This will make Thailand its first production hub in ASEAN, partly thanks to the country’s generous subsidy which is as much as 150,000 bahts ($4,340) per EV (Nikkei Asia, September 2022).\nElsewhere, China’s investment in Malaysia is equally important. Risen Energy, China’s solar energy firm, announced its first facility investment in Southeast Asia, worth $10 billion+ over 15 years, to manufacture high-efficiency photovoltaic modules.\nChinese firms have also made a move in Singapore. In late 2022, two Chinese firms, WuXi Biologics and WuXi AppTec, have announced a S$4 billion (US$2.98 billion) investment into the country’s pharmaceutical manufacturing, the second-largest sub-sector after electronics.\nThe spreading supply chain across Asia is already resulting in increased capability and production quality in the countries closest to China. Continued investment, the right partnerships and new trade agreements such as the RCEP, will likely bring to the wider Southeast Asia region a degree of the economic advancement China has already been enjoying.\nASEAN has the potential to become one of the world’s key manufacturing hubs. The region has favorable demographics, comparatively lower wages, is strategically located, and boasts production synergies. The opportunity for Southeast Asia countries to “grab” some of China’s manufacturing advantage is ripe. Yet to attract more global production and remain competitive with China, deeper efficiency improvements will need to be implemented in the region.\nDespite the shadows cast by the global pandemic in the last few years and other market uncertainties, we see the coming years as a period of great promise for Southeast Asia, brimming with potentials ranging from sustainability and digital technology to trade and wealth. This also creates unprecedented opportunities for Chinese companies that are seeking continuous growth and global presence in the post-covid era.\nThe key to unlocking opportunities is not just to understand the dynamics of each market, but to understand how to help businesses across markets connect and work together - from the automotive sector in Thailand and electronic manufacturing in Malaysia to natural resources in Indonesia and pharmaceutical and financial services in Singapore.\n&nbsp;***\nFrancois de Maricourt is president director of PT Bank HSBC Indonesia, and Mark Wang is president and CEO of HSBC China.\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nRelated Articles\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources\nIs Southeast Asia the next frontier for AI?\nASEAN ministers to discuss Myanmar at Thailand meeting, Indonesia says\nRI manufacturing activity sees slight uptick amid underwhelming sales\nMalaysia urges Chinese firms to avoid using it to dodge US tariffs\nRelated Article\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources\nIs Southeast Asia the next frontier for AI?\nASEAN ministers to discuss Myanmar at Thailand meeting, Indonesia says\nRI manufacturing activity sees slight uptick amid underwhelming sales\nMalaysia urges Chinese firms to avoid using it to dodge US tariffs\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nMore in Opinion\nView more\nAcademia\nThe bottom-up wave of democratic rejuvenation\nAcademia\nPolice brutality: Fundamental problems in the institution\nAcademia\nFree trade deals increase Indonesian imports more than exports\nHighlight\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEditorial\nNarrow margin\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nThe Latest\nView more\nTech\nUS finalizes $6.1 billion Micron chip-making subsidy\nArchipelago\nTwo foreign visitors killed in tree collapse in Monkey Forest\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEconomy\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources\nRegulations\nBullion bank to launch in first half of next year, Airlangga says\nMiddle East and Africa\nAirline pilots, crews voice concerns about Middle East routes\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nRegulations\nEY worker's death spotlights India's unprotected white-collar labor"

(Reuters/Jason Lee)\nT\noday marks the 96th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (CPLA). Over the past 96 years, the CPLA has made indelible contributions to the independence of the Chinese nation and the liberation of the Chinese people, to national sovereignty, security and development interests, and to world peace and human progress.\nIn the new era, the CPLA, under the guidance of President Xi Jinping’s Thought on Strengthening the Military, focuses on its centenary goal, marching toward world-class armed forces at a faster pace and makes new progress in the modernization of national defense and the military.\nFacing the future, the CPLA will actively fulfill its international responsibilities as the armed forces of a major country and strive to make greater contributions to a world of lasting peace and universal security.\nFirst, we will unswervingly pursue a defensive national defense policy. President Xi emphasized that China has always been the builder of world peace, the contributor to global development and the defender of international order.\nIt is not in the genes of the Chinese nation to invade and dominate others. The Chinese people love and cherish peace. We take it as a sacred duty to maintain world peace and oppose hegemonism and power politics.\nChina will continue to pursue an independent foreign policy of peace, stay on the path of peaceful development, and work for a new type of international relations. History has proven and will always prove that China as a major country will never follow the old path of seeking hegemony. No matter how China develops in the future, China will never seek domination, expansion or spheres of influence.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nSecond, we will staunchly pursue a community with a shared future for mankind. On the way forward, China will resolutely practice the new vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security, practice true multilateralism, uphold the common values of all mankind, and actively participate in the reform and building of the global governance system.\nWe will also promote an open world economy, and implement the Global Development Initiative, Global Security Initiative and Global Civilization Initiative, injecting more stability and positive energy into world peace and development.\nThe CPLA will faithfully implement the vision of the community with a shared future for mankind, actively fulfill the responsibilities of the armed forces of a major country, vigorously strengthen international military-security exchanges and dialogues, develop defense relations that are non-aligned, non-confrontational and non-targeting of third parties, and promote the establishment of a fair, effective and collective security mechanism and military mutual trust mechanism, actively expand the space for military security cooperation and create a security environment conducive to peaceful development.\nThird, we will unwaveringly maintain world peace and stability. The security of one country cannot be built on the instability and insecurity of other countries. China will, as always, uphold peace, development and win-win cooperation, and work for a new type of international relations featuring mutual benefits.\nThe CPLA is providing the international community with more and more public security goods, including international peacekeeping, antiterrorism cooperation, antipiracy escorts and humanitarian assistance. China sends more peacekeepers than any other permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. It is the second-largest contributor to the UN regular budget and peacekeeping assessments.\nSince 2008, the CPLA has carried out escort missions to the Gulf of Aden and waters off Somalia. China has dispatched 44 escort fleets for the protection of more than 7,100 Chinese and foreign ships, and rescued more than 70 ships in distress.\nFacts have proven that China not only creates favorable conditions for its own development by maintaining world peace, but also preserves world peace better through its own development. The stronger the CPLA is, the stronger the force for peace and against wars will be, and the better world peace and development will be guaranteed.\nFourth, China will unswervingly be a good neighbor, good friend and good partner of Indonesia. Under the strategic guidance of President Xi and President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo, the comprehensive strategic partnership between China and Indonesia keeps growing.\nThe two countries have entered a new era of China-Indonesia community with a shared future. Exchanges and cooperation between the two countries in various fields are increasingly frequent and fruitful, delivering benefits to the two peoples and positive contributions to global and regional peace, stability, development and cooperation.\nThe relationship between the two armed forces is an important part of the bilateral relations. Cooperation in joint exercises, personnel training, equipment technology and other fields has become increasingly effective.\nLast November, the hospital ship Peace Ark of the Chinese Navy paid a friendly visit to Jakarta and provided free medical services to the local people. Last June, two warships of the Chinese Navy came to Indonesia to participate in the “Komodo-2023” Multinational Naval Exercise.\nMost recently the Chinese National Defense University Field Teaching delegation composed of more than 50 senior officers visited Indonesia last month. These exchanges and cooperation have injected impetus into the in-depth development of the relationship between the armed forces of the two nations.\nThe world today is undergoing major changes unseen in a century. Peace and development are still the themes of the times. However, we are facing increasingly severe risks and challenges. China and Indonesia should work together to future strengthen communication and cooperation in regional and international forums, and firmly support each other on issues concerning each other’s core interests.\nWe believe that through our joint efforts, the relationship between our two countries and two armed forces will surely move up to a new level, and will definitely make new and greater contributions to global and regional peace and promoting common prosperity!\n&nbsp;***\nThe writer is defense attaché, Embassy of the People’s Republic of China in the Republic of Indonesia.\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nRelated Articles\nPutin’s India visit aims to shape global multipolarity\n20 years of the Aceh tsunami: From ‘megathrust’ threat to disaster mitigation\nChina to curbs exports of key chipmaking components to US\nTaiwan's Lai kicks off Marshall Islands visit as China fumes\nPrabowo’s balancing act\nRelated Article\nPutin’s India visit aims to shape global multipolarity\n20 years of the Aceh tsunami: From ‘megathrust’ threat to disaster mitigation\nChina to curbs exports of key chipmaking components to US\nTaiwan's Lai kicks off Marshall Islands visit as China fumes\nPrabowo’s balancing act\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nMore in Opinion\nView more\nAcademia\nThe bottom-up wave of democratic rejuvenation\nAcademia\nPolice brutality: Fundamental problems in the institution\nAcademia\nFree trade deals increase Indonesian imports more than exports\nHighlight\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEditorial\nNarrow margin\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nThe Latest\nView more\nTech\nUS finalizes $6.1 billion Micron chip-making subsidy\nArchipelago\nTwo foreign visitors killed in tree collapse in Monkey Forest\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEconomy\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources\nRegulations\nBullion bank to launch in first half of next year, Airlangga says\nMiddle East and Africa\nAirline pilots, crews voice concerns about Middle East routes\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nRegulations\nEY worker's death spotlights India's unprotected white-collar labor"

From bilateral to multilateral, from regional to global, China has built different forms of communities with a shared future with dozens of countries and regions,” said Wang.\n“The global development initiative and the global security initiative have received clear support from more than 100 countries,” he added.\nWang also said China’s recently launched white paper could also help the world navigate the current geopolitical turbulence, especially as competition had become increasingly fierce with the return of a “Cold War mentality”, in addition to a rise in nontraditional security challenges such as terrorism, cyberattacks, transnational crimes and biosecurity.\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nRelated Articles\nIndonesia’s tourist sector: A new era of innovation and growth\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nNew mosque in Nusantara to replace Istiqlal as state mosque\nReflection on women’s fight for equality in Indonesian politics\nIndonesia to attend ASEAN ministers’ meeting on Myanmar\nRelated Article\nIndonesia’s tourist sector: A new era of innovation and growth\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nNew mosque in Nusantara to replace Istiqlal as state mosque\nReflection on women’s fight for equality in Indonesian politics\nIndonesia to attend ASEAN ministers’ meeting on Myanmar\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nMore in World\nView more\nMiddle East and Africa\nAirline pilots, crews voice concerns about Middle East routes\nAmericas\nLula 'stable' after emergency surgery\nAsia &amp; Pacific\nSouth Korea police raid president's office\nHighlight\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEditorial\nNarrow margin\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nThe Latest\nView more\nTech\nUS finalizes $6.1 billion Micron chip-making subsidy\nArchipelago\nTwo foreign visitors killed in tree collapse in Monkey Forest\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEconomy\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources\nRegulations\nBullion bank to launch in first half of next year, Airlangga says\nMiddle East and Africa\nAirline pilots, crews voice concerns about Middle East routes\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nRegulations\nEY worker's death spotlights India's unprotected white-collar labor"

(Antara/KCIC)\nC\nhina on Tuesday unveiled its blueprint for a better world, raised by President Xi Jinping in 2013, through a policy paper on building a global community of shared future.\nChina also said it will continue to push for green development in Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) projects, rejecting accusations that it has outsourced its environmental pollution, a senior official from China’s top economic planner said at a press conference on the wide-ranging policy paper about China’s global vision.\nThe White Paper titled “A Global Community of Shared Future: China’s Proposals and Actions” comes a decade after the vision was first proposed by Xi, and has been presented as his alternative to the current Western-led world order, with an emphasis on what it calls Chinese-style diplomacy and various global initiatives.\nThis year also marks the 10th anniversary of the BRI, and China will host the third Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation in October, with leaders and representatives from some 130 countries set to attend, including Russian President Vladimir Putin.\nBy July 2023, more than three-quarters of countries in the world and over 30 international organizations had signed agreements on Belt and Road cooperation with China, the White Paper said.\nIssued by the State Council Information Office, the White Paper said the vision rises above the exclusive rules of bloc politics, the notion of “might makes right” and the “universal values” defined by a handful of Western countries.\nChina has contributed to building a global community of shared future with actions including promoting high-quality Belt and Road cooperation, state news agency Xinhua said on Tuesday.\nAt the press conference, in a rare appearance beyond his usual annual press conference in March, Foreign Minister Wang Yi said that by putting forward the creative idea, President Xi has shown “the correct path for the world”, building a strong consensus for international cooperation.\nChina has also proposed solutions to major global challenges in fields such as health, climate change and cyber security, Wang added.\nHe said Beijing was willing to play a “constructive” role in the success of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in November in San Francisco, US.\nIt paves the way for a possible meeting between Xi and US President Joe Biden – both presidents last met on the sidelines of the Group of 20 (G20) leaders’ summit in November 2022 in Bali.\nXi did not attend the G20 summit in India earlier this month, missing an opportunity to meet Biden, and prompting the US to say China was “giving up” on the G20 and building an alternative world order.\n“Of course, we and all parties also hope that the United States will realize its responsibilities as a host, show due openness, fairness, tolerance and responsibility, and create better conditions for the smooth holding of the meeting,” Wang said, referring to the APEC&nbsp;summit.\nEarlier on Tuesday, Hong Kong Chief Executive John Lee said he had yet to receive any invitation to the November meeting. It follows US media reports in July that he had been barred from the meetings after being sanctioned by Washington for what it calls his role in cracking down on civil liberties in the Asian financial hub.\nWang repeated a frequent Chinese warning that China opposes “wanton expansion of military alliances” and the squeezing of the security space of other countries.\nBeijing has been critical of Washington’s continued attempts to increase military cooperation in the Indo-Pacific region, including the Quad and the AUKUS&nbsp;groupings. It particularly disagrees with bases that are being built by the US in the north of the Philippines.\nDialogue between China and the US has been gradually resuming despite continued tensions, with several high-level visits to Beijing in recent months by top US officials, including Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo.\nMeanwhile, not all is rosy with China’s BRI, which has come under widespread criticism for causing environmental destruction in project areas, including building coal-fired power plants overseas despite a national commitment domestically to reach peak carbon output by 2030, and to be carbon-neutral by 2060.\nEarlier this year,\na report\nin\nThe Jakarta Post\nsaid the Batang Toru hydropower project, which is 70 percent owned by Chinese-owned State Development and Investment Corporation’s subsidiary SDIC Power, encroached on the habitat of the endangered Tapanuli orangutan, forcing them to intrude on nearby farms and villages.\nRead also:\nChina’s big firms put reputation at risk in Batang Toru power plant\n“The joint construction of the ‘Belt and Road’ projects are carried out based on the principle of extensive consultation, joint construction and shared benefits,” Cong Liang, deputy director of the National Development and Reform Commission said in response to a question from\nThe Straits Times\nat the press conference.\n“Whether the development is green or not, I think the [partner country]&nbsp;knows best, the local people have the most say, and facts are always more convincing than words.”\nIt is “not worth refuting” the voices that slander the Green Silk Road – an initiative to make BRI projects more ecologically sustainable – and those who attempt to smear and interfere with joint projects will not succeed, he added.\nTouting the success of the BRI, officials said projects such as\nthe high-speed rail between Jakarta and Bandung\n, the Phnom Penh-Sihanoukville Expressway, and the Greek port of Piraeus have increased connectivity, rejuvenating the local economy with jobs and trade.\n“In the next step, the NDRC will work with relevant departments… (and) continue to build high-quality landmark projects, promote ‘small but beautiful’ projects, deepen cooperation in key areas such as infrastructure and people’s livelihood projects to achieve complementary advantages, mutual benefits and win-win results,” Cong said.\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nRelated Articles\nAssad's fall in Syria exposes limits of China's Middle East diplomacy\nChina lifts final bans on Australian red meat as trade row nears end\nBiden out of the picture as world leaders meet\nXi, Biden attend APEC summit, prepare to meet\nPeru's Chancay: China's megaport of entry to South America\nRelated Article\nAssad's fall in Syria exposes limits of China's Middle East diplomacy\nChina lifts final bans on Australian red meat as trade row nears end\nBiden out of the picture as world leaders meet\nXi, Biden attend APEC summit, prepare to meet\nPeru's Chancay: China's megaport of entry to South America\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nMore in World\nView more\nMiddle East and Africa\nAirline pilots, crews voice concerns about Middle East routes\nAmericas\nLula 'stable' after emergency surgery\nAsia &amp; Pacific\nSouth Korea police raid president's office\nHighlight\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEditorial\nNarrow margin\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nThe Latest\nView more\nTech\nUS finalizes $6.1 billion Micron chip-making subsidy\nArchipelago\nTwo foreign visitors killed in tree collapse in Monkey Forest\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEconomy\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources\nRegulations\nBullion bank to launch in first half of next year, Airlangga says\nMiddle East and Africa\nAirline pilots, crews voice concerns about Middle East routes\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nRegulations\nEY worker's death spotlights India's unprotected white-collar labor"

Over the past 96 years, the CPLA has made indelible contributions to the independence of the Chinese nation and the liberation of the Chinese people, to national sovereignty, security and development interests, and to world peace and human progress.\nIn the new era, the CPLA, under the guidance of President Xi Jinping’s Thought on Strengthening the Military, focuses on its centenary goal, marching toward world-class armed forces at a faster pace and makes new progress in the modernization of national defense and the military.\nFacing the future, the CPLA will actively fulfill its international responsibilities as the armed forces of a major country and strive to make greater contributions to a world of lasting peace and universal security.\nFirst, we will unswervingly pursue a defensive national defense policy. President Xi emphasized that China has always been the builder of world peace, the contributor to global development and the defender of international order.\nIt is not in the genes of the Chinese nation to invade and dominate others. The Chinese people love and cherish peace. We take it as a sacred duty to maintain world peace and oppose hegemonism and power politics.\nChina will continue to pursue an independent foreign policy of peace, stay on the path of peaceful development, and work for a new type of international relations. History has proven and will always prove that China as a major country will never follow the old path of seeking hegemony. No matter how China develops in the future, China will never seek domination, expansion or spheres of influence.\nSecond, we will staunchly pursue a community with a shared future for mankind. On the way forward, China will resolutely practice the new vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security, practice true multilateralism, uphold the common values of all mankind, and actively participate in the reform and building of the global governance system.\nWe will also promote an open world economy, and implement the Global Development Initiative, Global Security Initiative and Global Civilization Initiative, injecting more stability and positive energy into world peace and development.\nThe CPLA will faithfully implement the vision of the community with a shared future for mankind, actively fulfill the responsibilities of the armed forces of a major country, vigorously strengthen international military-security exchanges and dialogues, develop defense relations that are non-aligned, non-confrontational and non-targeting of third parties, and promote the establishment of a fair, effective and collective security mechanism and military mutual trust mechanism, actively expand the space for military security cooperation and create a security environment conducive to peaceful development.\nThird, we will unwaveringly maintain world peace and stability. The security of one country cannot be built on the instability and insecurity of other countries. China will, as always, uphold peace, development and win-win cooperation, and work for a new type of international relations featuring mutual benefits.\nThe CPLA is providing the international community with more and more public security goods, including international peacekeeping, antiterrorism cooperation, antipiracy escorts and humanitarian assistance. China sends more peacekeepers than any other permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. It is the second-largest contributor to the UN regular budget and peacekeeping assessments.\nSince 2008, the CPLA has carried out escort missions to the Gulf of Aden and waters off Somalia. China has dispatched 44 escort fleets for the protection of more than 7,100 Chinese and foreign ships, and rescued more than 70 ships in distress.\nFacts have proven that China not only creates favorable conditions for its own development by maintaining world peace, but also preserves world peace better through its own development. The stronger the CPLA is, the stronger the force for peace and against wars will be, and the better world peace and development will be guaranteed.\nFourth, China will unswervingly be a good neighbor, good friend and good partner of Indonesia. Under the strategic guidance of President Xi and President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo, the comprehensive strategic partnership between China and Indonesia keeps growing.\nThe two countries have entered a new era of China-Indonesia community with a shared future. Exchanges and cooperation between the two countries in various fields are increasingly frequent and fruitful, delivering benefits to the two peoples and positive contributions to global and regional peace, stability, development and cooperation.\nThe relationship between the two armed forces is an important part of the bilateral relations. Cooperation in joint exercises, personnel training, equipment technology and other fields has become increasingly effective.\nLast November, the hospital ship Peace Ark of the Chinese Navy paid a friendly visit to Jakarta and provided free medical services to the local people. Last June, two warships of the Chinese Navy came to Indonesia to participate in the “Komodo-2023” Multinational Naval Exercise.\nMost recently the Chinese National Defense University Field Teaching delegation composed of more than 50 senior officers visited Indonesia last month. These exchanges and cooperation have injected impetus into the in-depth development of the relationship between the armed forces of the two nations.\nThe world today is undergoing major changes unseen in a century. Peace and development are still the themes of the times. However, we are facing increasingly severe risks and challenges. China and Indonesia should work together to future strengthen communication and cooperation in regional and international forums, and firmly support each other on issues concerning each other’s core interests.\nWe believe that through our joint efforts, the relationship between our two countries and two armed forces will surely move up to a new level, and will definitely make new and greater contributions to global and regional peace and promoting common prosperity!\n&nbsp;***\nThe writer is defense attaché, Embassy of the People’s Republic of China in the Republic of Indonesia.\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nRelated Articles\nPutin’s India visit aims to shape global multipolarity\n20 years of the Aceh tsunami: From ‘megathrust’ threat to disaster mitigation\nChina to curbs exports of key chipmaking components to US\nTaiwan's Lai kicks off Marshall Islands visit as China fumes\nPrabowo’s balancing act\nRelated Article\nPutin’s India visit aims to shape global multipolarity\n20 years of the Aceh tsunami: From ‘megathrust’ threat to disaster mitigation\nChina to curbs exports of key chipmaking components to US\nTaiwan's Lai kicks off Marshall Islands visit as China fumes\nPrabowo’s balancing act\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nMore in Paper\nView more\nOpinion\nAnalysis: Govt adopts mandatory B35 biodiesel program as CPO prices tumble\nBusiness\nGlobal chip crunch stunts Indonesia car sales recovery\nBusiness\nXL profit falls in Q3 as tower sale income dries\nHighlight\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEditorial\nNarrow margin\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nThe Latest\nView more\nEconomy\nRI identifies 29 potential nuclear power plant sites\nEconomy\nChinese authorities are considering a weaker yuan as Trump trade risks loom, sources say\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia commences evacuation of 37 citizens in Damascus\nTech\nUS finalizes $6.1 billion Micron chip-making subsidy\nArchipelago\nTwo foreign visitors killed in tree collapse in Monkey Forest\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEconomy\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources\nRegulations\nBullion bank to launch in first half of next year, Airlangga says"

China and regional countries including ASEAN, have made Asian voices heard and contributed Asian wisdom to regional and global governance, together bringing a wonderful \"Asian moment.\"\nAmid accelerated global changes and a lingering pandemic and with the world economy on a downward trajectory, global development is now beset by new challenges.\nThe G20, as the main forum for international economic cooperation, shoulders a great responsibility. President Xi called on all countries to embrace the vision of a community with a shared future for mankind, make global development more inclusive, beneficial to all and more resilient, so as to jointly address questions of the time, tide over difficulties and create a better future together.\nPresident Xi stated that prosperity and stability could not be possible in a world where the rich become richer while the poor are made poorer. Modernization is not a privilege reserved for any single country. Frontrunners in development should sincerely help others develop.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nPresident Xi also proposed building a global partnership for economic recovery and the International Cooperation Initiative on Global Food Security and explicitly supported the African Union (AU) in joining the G20.\nAt this major forum for international economic cooperation, President Xi focused on the major theme of development, reflecting the common aspirations of the international community including ASEAN countries as well as peoples of all nations and demonstrating China's role as a great power in leading global cooperation in the right direction.\nChina proposed the Global Development Initiative (GDI) to join hands with other countries to focus on the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. We are pleased to see ASEAN countries respond positively to this initiative and support the synergy between the GDI and relevant ASEAN initiatives. In the future, China and ASEAN will certainly lead and set an example of common global development.\nAPEC is the most important platform for economic cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region. President Xi emphasized at the APEC forum that over the past decades, robust economic cooperation in the region has created the “Asia-Pacific miracle” admired across the world. Asia-Pacific cooperation has taken deep roots in the hearts of the people.\nToday, the world has come to another historical crossroads and this has made the Asia-Pacific region even more important and prominent in its standing and role.\nPresident Xi took stock of the experience and inspiration of the “Asia-Pacific miracle” and put forward the important idea of building an Asia-Pacific community with a shared future that enjoys peace, stability and prosperity for all, that is clean and beautiful and where all are ready to help each other, pointing out the direction and path for the future development of the region.\nChina has worked with ASEAN to promote the signing and entry into force of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) and applied to join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) and the Digital Economy Partnership Agreement (DEPA). China and ASEAN, both in the Asia-Pacific region, are all practitioners and promoters of economic integration in the region.\nWe believe that with the joint efforts of both sides, the Asia-Pacific region will continue to be the fastest growing and most vibrant region in the world, further driving the world economy forward.\nPresident Xi stressed that ASEAN is a priority in China's neighborhood diplomacy and that China is willing to work with Indonesia, Thailand and other ASEAN countries to focus on development and cooperation and promote the building of the “five homes.” China, together with Indonesia and Thailand respectively, has reaffirmed its commitment to building a community with a shared future and strengthening the synergy between development strategies.\nChina and Indonesia signed the new five-year Plan of Action for Strengthening of the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership. China and Thailand signed a joint action plan for strategic cooperation. A new pattern of high-level cooperation has been built.\nThis will undoubtedly set good examples for the course of building a community with a shared future between China and ASEAN, as well as between China and other countries in the Asia-Pacific region, and gather broader international forces for the building of a community with a shared future for mankind.\nOver the past three years since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, trade between China and ASEAN has grown against the odds. We have become each other's largest trading partner, with two-way trade reaching US$798.4 billion in the first 10 months of 2022, up by 13.8 percent year-on-year. We have jointly announced the official launch of negotiations on a new round of upgrade of the China-ASEAN Free Trade Area, which will further enhance the quality and level of trade and investment cooperation between the two sides.\nThe opening of the Phnom Penh-Sihanoukville Expressway has taken Cambodia into a “high-speed era.” With the China-Laos Railway, the Laos dream of becoming a land-linked country has come true.\nThe Jakarta-Bandung High-Speed Railway, the first of its kind across ASEAN, has begun its trial operation. The construction of the China-Laos-Thailand Railway and the Malaysia East Coast Rail Link is gaining traction. The China-Malaysia and China-Indonesia “Two Countries, Twin Parks” have grown bigger and stronger. High-quality Belt and Road cooperation has made more and more iconic achievements.\nLooking ahead, China and ASEAN should continue to enhance friendship, mutual trust and integration of interests, work together to promote sustainable development, move toward modernization, build a peaceful, safe and secure, prosperous, beautiful and amicable home, continue to deepen the comprehensive strategic partnership and continue to draw new chapters in building a China-ASEAN community with a shared future.\n***\nThe author is the Chinese Ambassador to ASEAN.\n&nbsp;\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nRelated Articles\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nIs Southeast Asia the next frontier for AI?\nPhilippines agrees to transfer proposal for prisoner Mary Jane Veloso\nChina lifts final bans on Australian red meat as trade row nears end\nSantika Indonesia partners with Janto Group to open new hotel in Jakarta\nRelated Article\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nIs Southeast Asia the next frontier for AI?\nPhilippines agrees to transfer proposal for prisoner Mary Jane Veloso\nChina lifts final bans on Australian red meat as trade row nears end\nSantika Indonesia partners with Janto Group to open new hotel in Jakarta\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nMore in Opinion\nView more\nAcademia\nThe bottom-up wave of democratic rejuvenation\nAcademia\nPolice brutality: Fundamental problems in the institution\nAcademia\nFree trade deals increase Indonesian imports more than exports\nHighlight\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEditorial\nNarrow margin\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nThe Latest\nView more\nTech\nUS finalizes $6.1 billion Micron chip-making subsidy\nArchipelago\nTwo foreign visitors killed in tree collapse in Monkey Forest\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEconomy\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources\nRegulations\nBullion bank to launch in first half of next year, Airlangga says\nMiddle East and Africa\nAirline pilots, crews voice concerns about Middle East routes\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nRegulations\nEY worker's death spotlights India's unprotected white-collar labor"

China has witnessed remarkable progress on all fronts, called a “China miracle” by many ASEAN friends. As to how this “China miracle” has been achieved, I believe there is something worth sharing.\nFirst, China has chosen a development path suited to its own realities. China started from scratch when it was founded in 1949. Today it is the world’s second-largest economy, the largest industrial powerhouse and the biggest trader in goods. Over 700 million Chinese people have been lifted out of extreme poverty, an extraordinary journey and the key to success is socialism with Chinese characteristics.\nSecond, China has followed a development approach in keeping abreast of the times. With continued growth for seven decades, the principle task facing China today has shifted from meeting people’s basic needs for material and cultural pursuits to people’s ever-growing demands for a better-off life. The fine-tuning of major tasks signifies the change of focus with the change of time and a major shift in the development approach, a shift from speed to quality, from “is it fast enough?” to “is it good enough?”\nMore emphasis has been put on a balanced approach and coordinated development across the economic, political, cultural, social and environmental spheres, or what we call the “five-sphere integrated plan”. It stresses innovative, coordinated, green and open development for all.\nThird, China has adopted the national policy of reform and opening up. China has made the historic decision of reform and opening-up in the late 1970s, which is unprecedented and which allowed the Chinese people “to cross the river by feeling for the stones”. Adventurous reforms were carried out with indomitable will. Difficulties of all kinds were overcome one after another. China’s development kept scaling new heights through ever-deepening reforms.\nFourth, China has followed the development philosophy of win-win cooperation. China remains committed to the path of peaceful development and the strategy of opening up for win-win outcomes. It engages in building world peace, contributes to global development and upholds international order and multilateralism.\nPresident Xi Jinping proposed to build a new type of international relations, a community with a shared future for mankind and the Belt and Road Initiative, contributing Chinese wisdom to how international relations could be handled and how international cooperation for win-win result could be achieved.\nChina’s development has global implications, as it benefits not only the people of China but also the rest of the world. It also has special significance for ASEAN, as ASEAN and China are interconnected and share weal and woe.\nWe are close neighbors that respect each other and enjoy harmonious coexistence. ASEAN and China respect each other’s development path, respect and support each other on issues of core interests and major concerns, and handle differences through dialogue and consultation. China remains committed in supporting ASEAN centrality and ASEAN’s bigger role in regional and international affairs.\nAs partners for common development, ASEAN and China are witnesses of each other’s growth story and supporters of each other’s development. Over the years, China remains a strong and firm supporter of ASEAN community building and ASEAN integration. And our two sides have grown to be closer partners of strategic cooperation. We support each other in times of difficulty. We came to each other’s help in fighting the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome epidemic and in carrying out disaster-relief when a tsunami hit Indian Ocean countries. We stood side by side to tide over the Asian financial crisis and the international financial crisis. These hard moments have made us brothers and partners.\nWe are champions for shared values and responsibilities. ASEAN and China jointly uphold the rules-based multilateral trading system and reject unilateralism and protectionism. We work together to formulate rules at sea to safeguard regional peace and stability. We champion the spirit of regional cooperation with East Asia characteristics, such as equality, seeking common ground while reserving differences, openness, inclusiveness and mutual learning, aiming to uphold multilateralism and our Asian values.\nConnected by mountains and seas, ASEAN and China enjoy a long history of amity and cooperation and are already a close-knit community of shared prosperity. President Xi proposed to build a closer ASEAN-China community with a shared future. With his guidance, the “ASEAN-China Strategic Partnership Vision 2030” was formulated last year.\nAgainst the increasing uncertainties in the region and beyond and intensifying unilateralism and multilateralism, ASEAN and China are strengthening cooperation and meeting challenges head on.\nOur strategic partnership is full of vitality and vibrancy. History has proven and will continue to prove that China’s greater development will contribute to a closer ASEAN-China community for an even brighter future.\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nRelated Articles\nThe sources of Japanese resilience\nVietnam's soaring US trade surplus stokes new fears of tariffs\nPhilippine president says Russian submarine in South China Sea 'worrisome'\nVietnam to build $67 billion high-speed railway\nChina says top military official Miao Hua suspended, under investigation\nRelated Article\nThe sources of Japanese resilience\nVietnam's soaring US trade surplus stokes new fears of tariffs\nPhilippine president says Russian submarine in South China Sea 'worrisome'\nVietnam to build $67 billion high-speed railway\nChina says top military official Miao Hua suspended, under investigation\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nMore in Academia\nView more\nAcademia\nThe bottom-up wave of democratic rejuvenation\nAcademia\nPolice brutality: Fundamental problems in the institution\nAcademia\nFree trade deals increase Indonesian imports more than exports\nHighlight\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEditorial\nNarrow margin\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nThe Latest\nView more\nTech\nUS finalizes $6.1 billion Micron chip-making subsidy\nArchipelago\nTwo foreign visitors killed in tree collapse in Monkey Forest\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEconomy\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources\nRegulations\nBullion bank to launch in first half of next year, Airlangga says\nMiddle East and Africa\nAirline pilots, crews voice concerns about Middle East routes\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nRegulations\nEY worker's death spotlights India's unprotected white-collar labor"

Essentially, it serves as both a decade's report card and a visionary roadmap for the future of Belt and Road collaboration. From its ambitious inception to its execution, the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) has surpassed its early projections in remarkable ways over the past decade.\nIn terms of geographic reach, the BRI has garnered participation from more than 150 countries and over 30 international organizations, accounting for almost 75 percent of the world's population. Across the spectrum of its engagement, the BRI extends its influence into a diverse array of domains, spanning economics, culture, and ecology.\nWhether we're talking about the hard connectivity of land-based roads and sea routes, the soft connectivity entailing collaborative efforts to enhance rules and standards, or the people-to-people connectivity in various arenas like education, culture, sports, tourism, and archaeology, the BRI has woven a sprawling network of cooperation and shared gains across the world.\nThe BRI marked a defining moment in China's global involvement, signifying its ascent to a prominent position on the world platform. Throughout the past decade, it has ushered in a transformative era, leaving an indelible imprint on the global terrain and underscoring its far-reaching influence across the world.\nNumerous flagship projects, such as the Mombasa-Nairobi railway, the China-Laos railway, and the Jakarta-Bandung high-speed railway, are completed and operational. These milestones are poised to give a significant boost to emerging economies.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nAccording to World Bank estimates, by the year 2030, the BRI is expected to generate a staggering US$1.6 trillion in annual global revenue, equivalent to 1.3 percent of the global GDP. As this network of transport corridors and economic hubs continues to expand, there is immense potential for enhancing trade, spurring investment, and improving the quality of life for countless citizens across participating nations.\nSince the initiation of the BRI, the aspiration of forging a community with a shared future has evolved from mere conceptualization to concrete action and from visionary idealism to tangible achievement. An increasing number of nations have come to appreciate China's assertion that development is not the exclusive privilege of a select few Western countries, but rather an inherent right accessible to all nations.\nThe BRI has orchestrated a profound transformation on the world stage for five compelling reasons. First, it has elevated the discourse on development to a pivotal global concern. Second, it has fostered an unprecedented bond between China and developing nations.\nThird, it has paved the path toward a fresh global realignment and, by extension, a novel paradigm of global politics. Fourth, it has disseminated the fundamental tenets of Chinese philosophy on a global scale.\nLastly, it has given rise to a novel breed of international institution, offering a tantalizing glimpse into a world order where the welfare of the majority takes precedence over the interests of the few—a truly remarkable reimagining of global dynamics.\nAlthough the initial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic temporarily slowed its progress, the BRI has since bounced back with renewed vigor as the world slowly returns to a semblance of normalcy. This resilience serves as a testament to the BRI's remarkable adaptability in the face of ever-shifting global conditions. Indeed, the BRI stands as a sturdy and agile force, mirroring the ever-changing contours of the world it engages with.\nA curious phenomenon emerges when we examine the spectrum of countries engaged in the BRI. Developing nations consistently exhibit a favorable stance toward BRI collaboration, whereas the sentiment among developed countries is not uniformly enthusiastic. It is essential to acknowledge that developing countries often bear more significant development burdens.\nNevertheless, it is important to note that the BRI's inclusive ethos extends to all nations, with a desire for the participation of as many countries as possible, including those that are more developed.\nEver since 2013 when China launched its magnanimous BRI, Western capitals have been viewing this monumental developmental project with skepticism; their response is tainted by an unwarranted wave of negativity and misinformation. It is quite evident that certain think tanks and media in the West, particularly within the United States, harbor certain political biases when it comes to their assessments of the BRI.\nIt is common to find these studies riddled with allegations of so-called debt traps, complaints of a lack of transparency and concerns about the environmental impact. It seems as though there is a concerted effort to cast a shadow over this monumental endeavor.\nThe BRI is not merely a vehicle for China's economic growth but a pathway to shared prosperity. It aims to bridge regional divides, boost trade, and foster sustainable development across Asia, Europe, Latin America and Africa.\nFrom 2013 to 2022, China's trade with BRI participant nations has surged to a whopping $19.1 trillion, marked by an annual growth rate averaging 6.4 percent. Impressively, the cumulative two-way investment between China and its partner countries has reached $380 billion, with China contributing $240 billion, as revealed in the white paper.\nThese numbers illuminate the transformative impact of the BRI, both as a catalyst for trade and as a source of significant investment in the participating nations, underscoring its pivotal role in shaping global economic dynamics.\nThe future of BRI cooperation is rich with possibilities. As highlighted in the white paper, the BRI is a profound, long-term, and systematic global endeavor of the 21st century, and it has embarked on an enduring journey. The original framework of BRI, while primarily focusing on partnerships with developing nations, has become the bedrock upon which the Global Development Initiative, Global Security Initiative, and Global Civilization Initiative have flourished.\nThese progressive offshoots represent an intentional expansion of the initial vision, offering a wide array of dynamic approaches to fortify global development and the accomplishments of the BRI.\nAs traditional infrastructure projects persist, the rising prominence of digital connectivity is set to drive substantial demand for digital infrastructure across the region. This digital frontier is poised to assume a central role in the next phase of BRI implementation.\nConcurrently, the green and blue economies are poised to emerge as twin drivers. These multifaceted developments paint a promising picture for growth, collaboration and shared prosperity.\n&nbsp;***\nThe writer is an international affairs observer based in Karachi.\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nRelated Articles\nGovt expects Apple to up investment commitment to $1 billion\nGovt halts big infrastructure in trade-off for food security: Minister\nMeaningful digital transformation for the Asia-Pacific region\nFor Indonesia, Trumponomics will be another headwind\nLiquidity challenges and growth expectations in the new government era\nRelated Article\nGovt expects Apple to up investment commitment to $1 billion\nGovt halts big infrastructure in trade-off for food security: Minister\nMeaningful digital transformation for the Asia-Pacific region\nFor Indonesia, Trumponomics will be another headwind\nLiquidity challenges and growth expectations in the new government era\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nMore in Opinion\nView more\nAcademia\nThe bottom-up wave of democratic rejuvenation\nAcademia\nPolice brutality: Fundamental problems in the institution\nAcademia\nFree trade deals increase Indonesian imports more than exports\nHighlight\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEditorial\nNarrow margin\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nThe Latest\nView more\nTech\nUS finalizes $6.1 billion Micron chip-making subsidy\nArchipelago\nTwo foreign visitors killed in tree collapse in Monkey Forest\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEconomy\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources\nRegulations\nBullion bank to launch in first half of next year, Airlangga says\nMiddle East and Africa\nAirline pilots, crews voice concerns about Middle East routes\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nRegulations\nEY worker's death spotlights India's unprotected white-collar labor"

In a press briefing, Ambassador Hou discussed the progress of China-ASEAN cooperation in various fields, as well as expectations for the upcoming leaders’ meetings on East Asia Cooperation.\nShe opened the meeting by expressing her support for Indonesia as the ASEAN chair this year and stated that she expects continuous cooperation and a deepened relationship between China and member countries, which she hopes will be further discussed at the summit planned for September.\nIn line with the theme chosen by Indonesia, “ASEAN Matters: Epicentrum of Growth,\" Hou expects the meetings to focus on dialogue and cooperation to promote development and prosperity and therefore bring more stability and certainty about what the future holds.\nFurthermore, she reiterated President Xi Jinping's proposal of jointly building a peaceful, safe and secure, prosperous, beautiful and amicable environment, evidenced by China’s move to promote the Southeast Asia Nuclear Weapon-Free Zone (SEANWFZ).\nThe ambassador informed the media of the long diplomatic history between China and ASEAN member countries, especially through frequent high-level exchanges. China and ASEAN organized grand commemorative activities to mark the 20\nth\nanniversary of China’s accession to the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation in Southeast Asia (TAC), in order to continue to jointly uphold and promote the TAC spirit and safeguard lasting peace in the region.\nAmbassador Hou also gave a comprehensive introduction to China's support for ASEAN's community building in the three pillars of the ASEAN Socio-Cultural Community (ASCC), the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) and the ASEAN Political-Security Community (APSC) that were first created to ensure more equity and harmony in the region.\nChina has been a partner of several member countries in areas such as growth and has formed partnerships in the fields of new energy, the digital economy and science and technology innovation through both state-owned and local companies in the region. China has vigorously promoted exchanges and cooperation with ASEAN in education, science and technology, culture, youth, poverty reduction and tourism.\nWhile bringing the event to a close, she introduced the Global Development Initiative (GDI), the Global Security Initiative (GSI) and the Global Civilization Initiative (GSI) proposed by President Xi, stressing China's willingness to work with ASEAN countries to build a tighter-knit community with a shared future.\nShe also highlighted the organizations shared between ASEAN and China, such as the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and the ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific (AOIP), reiterating the mutual benefits that are enjoyed by Indonesia and China in both projects.\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nRelated Articles\nTrump names New York Rep.

This was President Xi Jinping’s farsighted initiative for us to revisit these principles and how they are still useful in facing future challenges.\nThe Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence was a seminal proposal by Zhou Enlai and Jawaharlal Nehru, the respective prime ministers of China and India at the time. The fundamental tenet of this proposal is mutual respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all parties involved.\nFurthermore, it calls for a mutual nonaggression, noninterference in each other's internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit. Finally, it advocates for peaceful coexistence.\nThese enlightened principles encapsulated the wisdom of the two world's greatest and most ancient civilizations.\nThis year we also celebrate the 11th anniversary since China introduced the concept of Building a Community with a Shared Future for Mankind, which was first articulated by President Xi in 2013 and represents a modern approach to global governance and cooperation.\nIt emphasizes the interconnection of nations in an increasingly globalized world and advocates mutual respect, mutual benefit and win-win cooperation.

(Presidential Palace Press Bureau/Laily Rachev)\nC\nhina has increasingly become the center of attention on the world stage in recent years. In my decades-long interactions with friends and colleagues from the ASEAN family, I could always find heart-warming friendliness but also uncertainty about China from time to time, which is, unfortunately, exacerbated recently by the misleading smearing of China by a few Western politicians.\nA question of common interest thus emerges: Where is China’s foreign policy heading and what is it aiming for?\nThe Xi Jinping Thought on Diplomacy doctrine would be the most authoritative answer to this question. Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC), the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core has put forward a series of new ideas, new propositions and new initiatives, pointing the direction and providing fundamental guidance for China’s foreign policy.\nChina is committed to building a community with a shared future for mankind, which is the essence of Xi Jinping Thought on Diplomacy.\nPresident Xi points out, “Humankind, by living in the same global village within the same time and space where history and reality meet, has increasingly emerged as an intimate community of shared future. No country could meet the challenges for mankind alone.”\nThe foresight of this vision is once again proved to be true in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.\nTo build a community with a shared future for mankind is the goal of China’s foreign policy. Toward this end, China has been working hard all along, and the most recent effort would be our engagement in international cooperation against COVID-19. As far as ASEAN is concerned, China provided COVID-19-related information in a timely manner, shared experience in control and treatment, and offered a large number of medical supplies.\nThe revival of the regional economy as soon as possible presents another daunting challenge of the day. China has opened or is planning to open “fast-track lanes” for essential personnel exchanges and “green channels” for cargo transportation with Singapore, Myanmar, Indonesia and Malaysia. China and ASEAN countries are also jointly working on COVID-19 vaccine research and development, as well as production. It’s good to know that phase III clinical trials of a vaccine developed in China was rolled out in Indonesia days ago.\nChina is committed to the path of peaceful development. There are people in the West who apply the “Thucydides Trap” or “Kindleberger Trap” to interpret China’s rapid development. Trapped in the belief that “a strong country must seek hegemony”, they demonize China as a potential danger to the world.\nOn the contrary, the Chinese culture holds dear harmony and unity; harmony being the most valuable and harmony without uniformity. Invasion and hegemony-seeking have never been in the Chinese DNA. Facts still speak louder than words. For instance, China’s military expenditure was an average of 1.3 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in the last 10 years, lower than the world average.\nChina has always been dedicated to resolving disputes through negotiations in peace while safeguarding China’s territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests. Guided by the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the spirit of fostering amity and friendship with neighbors, China has properly solved most of the leftover boundary issues step by step with neighboring countries in the past seven decades, and the delineated boundary is about 90 percent of China’s total boundary on land.\nRegarding disputes over the South China Sea, China remains committed to the “dual-track” approach of resolving disputes peacefully through consultation and negotiation between countries directly concerned and of upholding peace and stability in the South China Sea by China and ASEAN countries through joint efforts, including regional rules-making.\nIn 2013, President Xi put forward the major initiatives of the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road, which later turned into the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). It focuses on economic cooperation, rather than geopolitical alliance. It is open and inclusive and rests upon extensive consultation, joint contribution and shared benefits.\nSix years on, the initiative is materializing and has become one of the most popular global public goods. It is exciting to see flourishing BRI cooperation between China and ASEAN countries in infrastructure, energy, manufacturing, industrial parks and more. Such cooperation has already delivered real dividends to local development and people.\nPopulism, protectionism, unilateralism and antiglobalization sentiments are proliferating now. Certain countries attribute their domestic problems to external shocks, claiming that they have been “taken advantage of ” in the existing trading system. They adopt various measures, including trade, to suppress the development of others, even willfully withdrawing from international treaties and organizations and scapegoating others. Their behavior has seriously violated the multilateral trading system.\nYet despite this, as a firm defender of economic globalization and multilateral trading system, China continues to promote trade and investment liberalization and facilitation, a fair, equitable and transparent system of international economic and trading rules, as well as a more open, connected and integrated global economy.\nThe existing international system was established after World War II under the leadership of United States-led Western countries. Despite its deficiencies and drawbacks, it has played an important role in maintaining world peace and development over the past 70 years. The purpose of reforming the current international system is not to overturn it and start anew, but to adjust and improve it within the overall framework and to make it better adapted to the evolved international landscape.\nChina firmly safeguards the core role of the United Nations in global governance and promotes the building of a more just and equitable international governance system. China honors its commitments on global issues such as climate change by staying on course of green, low-carbon and sustainable development.\nChina will do well only when the world does well and vice versa. On our way toward a community with a shared future, China will work together with ASEAN countries and all other countries in the world to eradicate poverty and seek prosperity and development, to end conflicts and uphold peace, and to bridge the gap between civilizations through exchanges and mutual learning.

In pursuing high-quality Belt and Road cooperation, we may promote the mutually beneficial cooperation between the Belt and Road Initiative and the ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific.\nOur cooperation may center on the following lines of efforts, namely trade and investment liberalization and facilitation, new-type industrialization, digitization, low-carbon development, agricultural modernization, etc.\nWe need to further tap the potential of cooperation; upgrade cooperation mechanisms and raise our collective competitiveness so as to realize the common development of 2 billion people in China and ASEAN; and contribute to peace, stability and prosperity of the region and the world.\nTo uphold openness and cooperation, we must have firm confidence in cooperation. In the face of complicated and complex international situations and surging risks and challenges, East Asian cooperation has been able to maintain a good momentum of steady development in general, an important reason of which is the formation of a multi-tiered and inter-connected architecture of regional cooperation.\nAnd the key to the success of this architecture is that it upholds ASEAN centrality, accommodates the interests of all parties and conforms to the regional reality.\nWe believe that as long as all parties sincerely support ASEAN centrality in East Asian cooperation, uphold the ASEAN way that maintains mutual respect and dialogue and consultation, support the ASEAN-led cooperation model that features mutually beneficial and win-win cooperation, and support the expanding and strengthening of the ASEAN-led regional architecture that is open and inclusive, East Asian cooperation will be able to stay strong and sustainable.\nIn the current situation, we should still have such confidence.\n&nbsp;***\nThe writer is Chinese Ambassador to ASEAN.\n&nbsp;\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nRelated Articles\nChina to curbs exports of key chipmaking components to US\nPhilippine president says Russian submarine in South China Sea 'worrisome'\nPrabowo calls for free, fair trade at APEC\nNo more cop-outs\nGermany bets on India to reduce reliance on China\nRelated Article\nChina to curbs exports of key chipmaking components to US\nPhilippine president says Russian submarine in South China Sea 'worrisome'\nPrabowo calls for free, fair trade at APEC\nNo more cop-outs\nGermany bets on India to reduce reliance on China\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nMore in Opinion\nView more\nAcademia\nThe bottom-up wave of democratic rejuvenation\nAcademia\nPolice brutality: Fundamental problems in the institution\nAcademia\nFree trade deals increase Indonesian imports more than exports\nHighlight\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEditorial\nNarrow margin\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nThe Latest\nView more\nEconomy\nRI identifies 29 potential nuclear power plant sites\nEconomy\nChinese authorities are considering a weaker yuan as Trump trade risks loom, sources say\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia commences evacuation of 37 citizens in Damascus\nTech\nUS finalizes $6.1 billion Micron chip-making subsidy\nArchipelago\nTwo foreign visitors killed in tree collapse in Monkey Forest\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEconomy\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources\nRegulations\nBullion bank to launch in first half of next year, Airlangga says"

(Reuters/Florence Lo)\nP\nresident\nPrabowo Subianto\n’s inaugural visit to China underscores a pivot toward great power diplomacy, a strategic approach that may mark a significant departure from Indonesia’s traditional stance more closely resembling what is now referred to and discussed as “middle power diplomacy.”\nOver the weekend, Prabowo met with key Chinese leaders, including Zhao Leji, chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Premier Li Qiang, and finally, President Xi Jinping. The visit yielded several notable agreements, such as a US$10 billion investment pledge between the countries and several memorandums of understanding related to water conservation, the blue economy and maritime resources, and mining.\nThe joint statement issued by the leaders, titled “Promoting Comprehensive Strategic Partnership and Building a China-Indonesia Community with a Shared Future”, reflects Prabowo’s strategic framing of China as an essential partner.\nFrom the various statements expressed by Prabowo, we can take a glimpse of how he stressed a multipolar world order, guided by principles like strategic autonomy, mutual trust, fairness and win-win cooperation.\nSuch a worldview indeed reflects the argument of the erosion of moral leadership by the very pole that has led the current global order, the United States, from unilateral protectionist policies, lack of appetite for all things multilateral, all the way to the moral quandary in the conflict in the Middle East.\nYet one aspect of this trip has raised concerns both domestically and internationally.

(AFP/Stringer)\nL\nast December, I arrived in Jakarta as China’s ambassador to ASEAN. Living in this bustling cosmopolitan city allows me to personally witness the vigorous economic development of ASEAN countries, enjoy the practical benefits that China-ASEAN economic and trade cooperation brings to the general public and thus become more convinced that the economic development and cooperation in the region still contain great potential.\nIn the face of the once-in-a-century pandemic that lasted more than three years, China and ASEAN have not only stood together in solidarity to fight COVID-19 but have also driven their respective economies to show resilience and strength.\nASEAN countries have seen rapid trade growth, continued recovery in consumption and burgeoning digital economies, with overall economic growth expected to exceed 5 percent in 2022. China’s economy has grown at an average rate of 4.8 percent over the past three years, and inflation has remained at a low 2 percent.\nChina-ASEAN bilateral trade even bucked the negative trend caused by the pandemic, jumping from US$641.5 billion in 2019 to $975.3 billion in 2022. Our two sides have been each other’s largest trading partner for many years.\nWith countries overcoming the pandemic and adjusting or lifting their pandemic prevention and control measures accordingly, the prospects for China-ASEAN economic and trade cooperation have become more promising.\nAccording to international investment banks, China’s domestic demand is expected to grow by 5 percent this year, driving the growth rate of some Asia-Pacific economies by about 0.4 percentage points. In particular, the accelerated recovery of China’s outbound tourism and other services trade will certainly inject greater momentum for ASEAN countries to boost their economies.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nSeizing development opportunities, releasing cooperation potential, achieving rapid recovery and promoting long-term development are the common aspirations of China and ASEAN countries at present. In this context, the first-round consultations of the Version 3.0 China-ASEAN Free Trade Area (ACFTA) negotiations were officially launched in early February, kicking off a new round of economic and trade cooperation upgrades.\nWe expect ACFTA 3.0 to better benefit the people of both sides. At present, more than 90 percent of commodities (about 7,000 kinds) already enjoy zero tariff treatment between China and ASEAN, enhancing business efficiency, social employment and people’s incomes.\nACFTA 3.0 will further reduce tariffs; regulate measures in fields of customs, inspection and quarantine; and enhance trade and investment liberalization and facilitation. It will also better protect the rights and interests of consumers on both sides, promote the development of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) and create more jobs.\nThe more efficient and smooth flow of economic factors within the region will eventually create a high-quality life that each of us can truly enjoy.\nWe also expect ACFTA 3.0 to give a strong impetus to regional high-quality development. ACFTA 3.0 is committed to achieving more inclusive, modern, comprehensive and win-win development, so as to better respond to the new needs and trends of China and ASEAN countries in pursuing industrial upgrading and high-quality development, especially the digital economy and green transformation.\nThis is conducive to fostering new drivers of economic growth and will also enhance deeper integration of regional industrial and supply chains, optimize the layout of production networks and enhance resilience against risks. In this process, China will actively provide technical and capacity-building support to ASEAN countries to achieve common high-quality development.\nFurther, we expect ACFTA 3.0 to inject momentum and confidence into building an open world economy\n.\nThe launch of ACFTA 3.0 negotiations demonstrates China’s determination to promote high-level opening up and shows that under the current complex regional and international situation, China and ASEAN have jointly opted for openness and freedom rather than a closed-door and exclusive approach, mutually beneficial cooperation rather than a beggar-thy-neighbor approach and deeper integration rather than decoupling or disrupting supply chains.\nACFTA 3.0 will be complementary and mutually reinforcing with the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) Agreement and other intra-regional economic and trade cooperation mechanisms to promote the region as an open and inclusive epicentrum of growth.\nThe 20\nth\nNational Congress of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) pointed out that China was pursuing a mutually beneficial strategy of opening up.\nThe country strives to create new opportunities for the world with its own development and to contribute its share to building an open global economy that delivers greater benefits to all peoples.\nI look forward to witnessing the early conclusion of negotiations and implementation of ACFTA 3.0 and believe it will be an excellent example of building a closer China-ASEAN community with a shared future, providing more opportunities for China and ASEAN, for the region, and for the world.\n&nbsp;***\nThe writer is the Chinese ambassador to ASEAN.\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nRelated Articles\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources\nXi says trade war with US will have 'no winners'\nGovt’s pitch to foreign housing developers no easy sell\nIndonesia's social entrepreneurship deserves Prabowo's attention\nStructured vocational internships: Bridging SMEs and skilled workforce in Indonesia\nRelated Article\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources\nXi says trade war with US will have 'no winners'\nGovt’s pitch to foreign housing developers no easy sell\nIndonesia's social entrepreneurship deserves Prabowo's attention\nStructured vocational internships: Bridging SMEs and skilled workforce in Indonesia\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nMore in Opinion\nView more\nAcademia\nThe bottom-up wave of democratic rejuvenation\nAcademia\nPolice brutality: Fundamental problems in the institution\nAcademia\nFree trade deals increase Indonesian imports more than exports\nHighlight\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEditorial\nNarrow margin\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nThe Latest\nView more\nEconomy\nRI identifies 29 potential nuclear power plant sites\nEconomy\nChinese authorities are considering a weaker yuan as Trump trade risks loom, sources say\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia commences evacuation of 37 citizens in Damascus\nTech\nUS finalizes $6.1 billion Micron chip-making subsidy\nArchipelago\nTwo foreign visitors killed in tree collapse in Monkey Forest\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEconomy\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources\nRegulations\nBullion bank to launch in first half of next year, Airlangga says"

Essentially, it serves as both a decade's report card and a visionary roadmap for the future of Belt and Road collaboration. From its ambitious inception to its execution, the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) has surpassed its early projections in remarkable ways over the past decade.\nIn terms of geographic reach, the BRI has garnered participation from more than 150 countries and over 30 international organizations, accounting for almost 75 percent of the world's population. Across the spectrum of its engagement, the BRI extends its influence into a diverse array of domains, spanning economics, culture, and ecology.\nWhether we're talking about the hard connectivity of land-based roads and sea routes, the soft connectivity entailing collaborative efforts to enhance rules and standards, or the people-to-people connectivity in various arenas like education, culture, sports, tourism, and archaeology, the BRI has woven a sprawling network of cooperation and shared gains across the world.\nThe BRI marked a defining moment in China's global involvement, signifying its ascent to a prominent position on the world platform. Throughout the past decade, it has ushered in a transformative era, leaving an indelible imprint on the global terrain and underscoring its far-reaching influence across the world.\nNumerous flagship projects, such as the Mombasa-Nairobi railway, the China-Laos railway, and the Jakarta-Bandung high-speed railway, are completed and operational. These milestones are poised to give a significant boost to emerging economies.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nAccording to World Bank estimates, by the year 2030, the BRI is expected to generate a staggering US$1.6 trillion in annual global revenue, equivalent to 1.3 percent of the global GDP. As this network of transport corridors and economic hubs continues to expand, there is immense potential for enhancing trade, spurring investment, and improving the quality of life for countless citizens across participating nations.\nSince the initiation of the BRI, the aspiration of forging a community with a shared future has evolved from mere conceptualization to concrete action and from visionary idealism to tangible achievement. An increasing number of nations have come to appreciate China's assertion that development is not the exclusive privilege of a select few Western countries, but rather an inherent right accessible to all nations.\nThe BRI has orchestrated a profound transformation on the world stage for five compelling reasons. First, it has elevated the discourse on development to a pivotal global concern. Second, it has fostered an unprecedented bond between China and developing nations.\nThird, it has paved the path toward a fresh global realignment and, by extension, a novel paradigm of global politics. Fourth, it has disseminated the fundamental tenets of Chinese philosophy on a global scale.\nLastly, it has given rise to a novel breed of international institution, offering a tantalizing glimpse into a world order where the welfare of the majority takes precedence over the interests of the few—a truly remarkable reimagining of global dynamics.\nAlthough the initial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic temporarily slowed its progress, the BRI has since bounced back with renewed vigor as the world slowly returns to a semblance of normalcy. This resilience serves as a testament to the BRI's remarkable adaptability in the face of ever-shifting global conditions. Indeed, the BRI stands as a sturdy and agile force, mirroring the ever-changing contours of the world it engages with.\nA curious phenomenon emerges when we examine the spectrum of countries engaged in the BRI. Developing nations consistently exhibit a favorable stance toward BRI collaboration, whereas the sentiment among developed countries is not uniformly enthusiastic. It is essential to acknowledge that developing countries often bear more significant development burdens.\nNevertheless, it is important to note that the BRI's inclusive ethos extends to all nations, with a desire for the participation of as many countries as possible, including those that are more developed.\nEver since 2013 when China launched its magnanimous BRI, Western capitals have been viewing this monumental developmental project with skepticism; their response is tainted by an unwarranted wave of negativity and misinformation. It is quite evident that certain think tanks and media in the West, particularly within the United States, harbor certain political biases when it comes to their assessments of the BRI.\nIt is common to find these studies riddled with allegations of so-called debt traps, complaints of a lack of transparency and concerns about the environmental impact. It seems as though there is a concerted effort to cast a shadow over this monumental endeavor.\nThe BRI is not merely a vehicle for China's economic growth but a pathway to shared prosperity. It aims to bridge regional divides, boost trade, and foster sustainable development across Asia, Europe, Latin America and Africa.\nFrom 2013 to 2022, China's trade with BRI participant nations has surged to a whopping $19.1 trillion, marked by an annual growth rate averaging 6.4 percent. Impressively, the cumulative two-way investment between China and its partner countries has reached $380 billion, with China contributing $240 billion, as revealed in the white paper.\nThese numbers illuminate the transformative impact of the BRI, both as a catalyst for trade and as a source of significant investment in the participating nations, underscoring its pivotal role in shaping global economic dynamics.\nThe future of BRI cooperation is rich with possibilities. As highlighted in the white paper, the BRI is a profound, long-term, and systematic global endeavor of the 21st century, and it has embarked on an enduring journey. The original framework of BRI, while primarily focusing on partnerships with developing nations, has become the bedrock upon which the Global Development Initiative, Global Security Initiative, and Global Civilization Initiative have flourished.\nThese progressive offshoots represent an intentional expansion of the initial vision, offering a wide array of dynamic approaches to fortify global development and the accomplishments of the BRI.\nAs traditional infrastructure projects persist, the rising prominence of digital connectivity is set to drive substantial demand for digital infrastructure across the region. This digital frontier is poised to assume a central role in the next phase of BRI implementation.\nConcurrently, the green and blue economies are poised to emerge as twin drivers. These multifaceted developments paint a promising picture for growth, collaboration and shared prosperity.\n&nbsp;***\nThe writer is an international affairs observer based in Karachi.\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nRelated Articles\nGovt expects Apple to up investment commitment to $1 billion\nGovt halts big infrastructure in trade-off for food security: Minister\nMeaningful digital transformation for the Asia-Pacific region\nFor Indonesia, Trumponomics will be another headwind\nLiquidity challenges and growth expectations in the new government era\nRelated Article\nGovt expects Apple to up investment commitment to $1 billion\nGovt halts big infrastructure in trade-off for food security: Minister\nMeaningful digital transformation for the Asia-Pacific region\nFor Indonesia, Trumponomics will be another headwind\nLiquidity challenges and growth expectations in the new government era\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nMore in Opinion\nView more\nAcademia\nThe bottom-up wave of democratic rejuvenation\nAcademia\nPolice brutality: Fundamental problems in the institution\nAcademia\nFree trade deals increase Indonesian imports more than exports\nHighlight\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEditorial\nNarrow margin\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nThe Latest\nView more\nEconomy\nRI identifies 29 potential nuclear power plant sites\nEconomy\nChinese authorities are considering a weaker yuan as Trump trade risks loom, sources say\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia commences evacuation of 37 citizens in Damascus\nTech\nUS finalizes $6.1 billion Micron chip-making subsidy\nArchipelago\nTwo foreign visitors killed in tree collapse in Monkey Forest\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEconomy\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources\nRegulations\nBullion bank to launch in first half of next year, Airlangga says"

(asean.org/-)\nT\nhe new year dawns amid changes unseen in a century, including the COVID-19 pandemic in particular. It will be a milestone year for China and ASEAN, as they usher in the 30\nth\nanniversary of China-ASEAN dialogue relations.\nA review of the 30 years shows an extraordinary journey defined by tremendous progress. In 1991, China and ASEAN initiated the dialogue process marked by the attendance of then-foreign minister Qian Qichen at the opening ceremony of the 24\nth\nASEAN Foreign Ministers’ Meeting. In 2003, China acceded to the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation in Southeast Asia, ASEAN’s first dialogue partner to do so, and established the China-ASEAN strategic partnership, which was again a trailblazing endeavor.\nBy 2010, the China-ASEAN Free Trade Area was up and running. In 2013, President Xi Jinping proposed to jointly build a closer China-ASEAN community with a shared future during his visit to ASEAN countries. In 2018, the China-ASEAN Strategic Partnership Vision 2030 was issued, a blueprint eyeing the future. Last year, after COVID-19 hit us all, China and ASEAN stood in firm solidarity to fight the virus, resume growth and protect people’s livelihoods.\nAmong ASEAN’s dialogue partners, China has been number one on many fronts, which enables our relations to be proudly defined as comprehensive, pioneering and creative. Just as President Xi said in the 17\nth\nChina-ASEAN Expo &amp; China-ASEAN Business and Investment Summit late last year, “The China-ASEAN relationship has grown into the most successful and vibrant model for cooperation in the Asia-Pacific and an exemplary effort in building a community with a shared future for mankind.”\nYet besides the ever-growing momentum, there are things that remain unchanged between China and ASEAN in 30 years. First, the shared commitment to peaceful development and good neighborliness.\nBoth China and ASEAN believe that prosperity is nowhere to be found without peace and stability. As permanent neighbors and close partners, China and ASEAN countries hold dear the tradition of mutual respect and mutual assistance and the wisdom of seeking common ground while shelving differences and resolving disagreements through dialogue and consultation.\nSecond, the shared commitment to common development and win-win cooperation. While China has remained ASEAN’s largest trading partner for 11 consecutive years, ASEAN surpassed the European Union last year as China’ s largest trading partner for the first time in history.\nThird is the shared commitment to multilateralism, openness and inclusiveness. ASEAN is tremendously inclusive as a regional organization that successfully accommodates political systems, religions and cultures that could not be more different. Multilateralism is in the genes of ASEAN. China has been firmly committed to supporting ASEAN centrality in regional cooperation and ASEAN’s greater role in building an open and inclusive regional architecture.\nNo matter what happens to the international and regional landscape, it has been a solid consensus between China and ASEAN to choose solidarity over division, openness over isolation and cooperation over confrontation.\nThe year 2021 means a lot for both China and ASEAN. It is the centenary year for the Communist Party of China, the first year of China’s 14\nth\nFive-Year Plan, and the start of China’s new journey to fully build a modern socialist country. For ASEAN’s part, it is halfway through the ASEAN Community Vision 2025, with significant achievements in the community-building of three pillars. ASEAN is preparing itself in every way for bigger progress. The special juncture coincides with the 30\nth\nanniversary of China-ASEAN relations, a new starting point brimming with new opportunities.\nHere are some highlights of the year that can be expected.\nFirst, China-ASEAN high-level exchanges will continue to guide our way forward. China looks forward to carrying out a number of events with ASEAN to celebrate the 30\nth\nanniversary. Our leaders will, as always, be engaged in close interactions and guide strategically.\nThe most recent engagement is taking place this week, with State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi visiting four ASEAN member states: Myanmar, Indonesia, Brunei and the Philippines. The China-ASEAN relationship is among the top priorities of his agenda. China is committed to doing its utmost to safeguarding the peace and stability of the South China Sea by deepening mutual trust, promoting cooperation and managing differences with relevant ASEAN countries.\nSecond, public health cooperation will be deepened to end the pandemic at an early date. China is actively exploring research and development and production cooperation on vaccines with ASEAN. As a total of 3 million doses of vaccines developed by Sinovac Biotech arrived in Indonesia recently, China will continue to take real action to make COVID-19 vaccines more affordable and accessible for the people of the region.\nChina will work with ASEAN to enhance its joint pandemic response, including setting up reserves of medical supplies and a liaison mechanism for public health emergencies and helping strengthen ASEAN’s public health performance, such as in personnel training, resource allocation and capacity building.\nThird, China and ASEAN need to keep the strong momentum of economic cooperation and accelerate regional economic recovery. We will work for the early entry into force of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), seek greater synergy in our policies for economic recovery, expand the scope of “fast tracks” for travel and “green lanes” for cargo transportation in a well thought out way and implement the China-ASEAN Free Trade Agreement and its upgraded protocol.\nWe will also promote high-quality Belt and Road cooperation by ensuring steady progress in key projects, including the China-Laos Railway, the China-Thailand Railway and the Jakarta-Bandung Railway, to enhance local infrastructure connectivity. We will seize the opportunities of the digital economy and cultivate new cooperation areas in e-commerce, big data, 5G and smart cities.\nFourth, creative efforts will be made to boost people-to-people exchanges and sustainable development. Flagship projects such as the China-ASEAN Young Leaders Scholarship and China-ASEAN Short Video Contest will expand new fronts of connections between the people. As 2021 is also the China-ASEAN Year of Sustainable Development, China wishes to increase cooperation with ASEAN in poverty reduction, environmental protection, disaster relief, climate change, among others, and explore the establishment of the blue economic partnership.\nSunshine will eventually dispel the shadows, and spring isn’t far behind. As we usher in the historic year of the 30\nth\nanniversary of China-ASEAN relations, we are ready to ride on the rising tide and build a closer China-ASEAN community with a shared future!\n&nbsp;***\nThe writer is Chinese ambassador to ASEAN.\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nRelated Articles\nAssad's fall in Syria exposes limits of China's Middle East diplomacy\nXi says trade war with US will have 'no winners'\nIs Southeast Asia the next frontier for AI?\nVietnam to build $67 billion high-speed railway\nMultilateral system in crisis\nRelated Article\nAssad's fall in Syria exposes limits of China's Middle East diplomacy\nXi says trade war with US will have 'no winners'\nIs Southeast Asia the next frontier for AI?\nVietnam to build $67 billion high-speed railway\nMultilateral system in crisis\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nMore in Academia\nView more\nAcademia\nThe bottom-up wave of democratic rejuvenation\nAcademia\nPolice brutality: Fundamental problems in the institution\nAcademia\nFree trade deals increase Indonesian imports more than exports\nHighlight\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEditorial\nNarrow margin\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nThe Latest\nView more\nEconomy\nRI identifies 29 potential nuclear power plant sites\nEconomy\nChinese authorities are considering a weaker yuan as Trump trade risks loom, sources say\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia commences evacuation of 37 citizens in Damascus\nTech\nUS finalizes $6.1 billion Micron chip-making subsidy\nArchipelago\nTwo foreign visitors killed in tree collapse in Monkey Forest\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEconomy\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources\nRegulations\nBullion bank to launch in first half of next year, Airlangga says"

Some 8 million bulk vaccines in four envirotainers were directly transported to state-owned pharmaceutical company PT Biofarma’s facilities in Bandung, West Java. (Courtesy of the COVID-19 Response and Economic Recovery Committee/. )\nC\nOVID-19 is still ravaging the world, with its variants creating new waves of infection around the globe. At this critical juncture, we should have united as one to fight the virus. However, attention has been distracted from time to time, as certain countries take advantage of COVID-19 origin-tracing to smear others and serve their political agenda.\nAt the onset of COVID-19, China reported the latest developments to the World Health Organization at the earliest possible time. Since then China has shared its response experience with the international community in a timely manner, assisted over 150 countries and international organizations with medical supplies to the best of its capability, and led the largest-scale global vaccine cooperation, thus making outstanding contributions to global public health security.\nChina has all along taken a scientific approach to the global cooperation in science-based origin-tracing. WHO experts were invited twice to China for research. They went to all the places they wanted to go and met all the people they wanted to meet. Then the report by the WHO-China joint study team was released in March this year, presenting the most authoritative, professional and science-based conclusions on origin-tracing.\nAccording to the report, experts concluded that “a laboratory leak is extremely unlikely” and put forward important recommendations, including “searching for possible early cases on a global scale” and “studying the possibility of cold-chain transmission of virus”. The report also sets out detailed recommendations for what next steps should be taken to trace the virus. Chinese experts also took the initiative to submit China’s proposal on the second phase of origin-tracing to the WHO\nInternational experts have fully affirmed China’s openness and transparency during the research process, the outcome of which is the scientific and authoritative report that forms the basis for the next stage of tracing.\nYet in the meantime, certain countries are obsessed with politically motivated origin-tracing. They have turned a blind eye to those science-based and authoritative conclusions and spread false information and lies to distort the positions of other countries.\nChina’s position on global origin-tracing is consistent and clear-cut. First, origin-tracing is a matter of science. It should be and can only be left to scientists to identify, through scientific research, the possible zoonotic source and animal-human transmission routes. No country has the right to put its own political interests above people’s lives, nor should a matter of science be politicized for the purpose of slandering and attacking others.\nSecond, the findings and recommendations of the WHO-China joint study report are widely recognized by the international community, especially scientists, and must be respected and implemented by all parties including the WHO. Going forward, global origin-tracing should and must proceed from that basis, instead of reinventing the wheel.\nThird, China has all along supported and will continue to take part in science-based origin-tracing efforts. What China opposes is politicizing origin-tracing, or origin-tracing that goes against the WHA resolutions and disregards the joint study report.\nFourth, the WHO Secretariat should act on the WHA resolutions, conduct thorough consultation with member states on the global origin-tracing work plan, including the follow-up mechanism, and fully respect the views of member states. Very importantly, the plan for origin-tracing involving a particular country must be decided through consultation with the country concerned, as it provides the basis for effective cooperation.\nOrigin-tracing cooperation must be based on science, and politicization must be firmly rejected. Nearly 80 countries, including multiple ASEAN member states, have recently expressed support for the WHO-China joint study report and opposed politicization of origin-tracing by sending letters to the WHO director-general and issuing statements and diplomatic notes.\nOrganizations in the civil society, think tanks and over 300 political parties from more than 100 countries and regions submitted a joint statement to the WHO Secretariat, calling on the WHO to conduct the study on COVID-19 origin-tracing objectively and fairly, and firmly opposing politicization. The legitimate appeal and voice of justice from the international community shall be heard.\nA virus knows no borders and does not distinguish between races. China, like other countries, is a victim of the pandemic and hopes to find out the origin and cut off its transmission as early as possible. Given the ongoing spread and rebound of the virus, the priority remains to be stepping up equitable distribution of COVID-19 vaccines and enhancing solidarity and cooperation.\nChina firmly supports efforts to make COVID-19 vaccines global public goods, opposes “vaccine nationalism” and rejects attempts to create a “vaccine divide”. To help ASEAN put the pandemic under control as quickly as possible, China has been overcoming difficulties to increase vaccine cooperation and aid with ASEAN. To date, China has provided all ASEAN member states with a total of 190 million COVID-19 vaccines and worked on vaccine trials with Indonesia and several other ASEAN countries. China shares with ASEAN technologies and experience and supports ASEAN countries in building regional vaccine production and distribution centers.\nAt the multilateral level, China has pledged to contribute 10 million doses of vaccines to the WHO-led COVAX program. As President Xi Jinping pledged a few days ago in his written message to the International Forum on COVID-19 Vaccine Cooperation, China will strive to provide 2 billion COVID-19 vaccine doses to the world throughout this year and offer US$100 million to COVAX that will be distributed to developing countries, including ASEAN countries.\nIn China’s vaccine cooperation with ASEAN, no geopolitical agenda is pursued, no economic gains are vied for, and no political conditions are attached. It is all about making the vaccines global public goods that are accessible and affordable to the people in ASEAN, so that ASEAN prevails over the pandemic once and for all and as early as possible. Going forward, China-ASEAN anti-pandemic cooperation will inject new impetus into China-ASEAN relations and bring about an even closer China-ASEAN community with a shared future.\nThe pandemic has unveiled shortcomings and loopholes in the global governance system of public health, sounding alarm for the international community. It won’t be the last public health emergency in our global village. Therefore, it is of paramount importance for the international community to be guided by the vision of building a global community with a shared future, reject political manipulation and jointly tackle challenges for the benefit of all.\n&nbsp;***\nThe writer is Chinese ambassador to ASEAN.\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nRelated Articles\nPutin’s India visit aims to shape global multipolarity\nTaiwan's Lai kicks off Marshall Islands visit as China fumes\nCollaboration is strengthening cybersecurity defenses in Indonesia\nInnovative, life-changing tools key to ending TB epidemic\nWong’s ASEAN consolidation\nRelated Article\nPutin’s India visit aims to shape global multipolarity\nTaiwan's Lai kicks off Marshall Islands visit as China fumes\nCollaboration is strengthening cybersecurity defenses in Indonesia\nInnovative, life-changing tools key to ending TB epidemic\nWong’s ASEAN consolidation\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nMore in Academia\nView more\nAcademia\nThe bottom-up wave of democratic rejuvenation\nAcademia\nPolice brutality: Fundamental problems in the institution\nAcademia\nFree trade deals increase Indonesian imports more than exports\nHighlight\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEditorial\nNarrow margin\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nThe Latest\nView more\nEconomy\nRI identifies 29 potential nuclear power plant sites\nEconomy\nChinese authorities are considering a weaker yuan as Trump trade risks loom, sources say\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia commences evacuation of 37 citizens in Damascus\nTech\nUS finalizes $6.1 billion Micron chip-making subsidy\nArchipelago\nTwo foreign visitors killed in tree collapse in Monkey Forest\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEconomy\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources\nRegulations\nBullion bank to launch in first half of next year, Airlangga says"

Built to support the operations of nickel producer PT Vale Indonesia, the power plant generates 110 megawatts, of which 10 MW are distributed to the surrounding community.  (Antara/Jojon)\nA\nSEAN countries are now shifting from traditional energy sources like coal to renewables, a change that will impact the region’s nearly 700 million lives. With most member states aiming for net-zero emissions by 2050, this transition is not only necessary but also an opportunity to create a fairer, greener economy.\nThis shift toward sustainable energy underscores the importance of a just transition that carefully addresses the socioeconomic impacts on communities and workers from traditional sectors. Internationally recognized frameworks and regional directives emphasize the need for robust social dialogue, active stakeholder involvement and the creation of equitable, green job opportunities.\nComprehensive strategies for reskilling and upskilling workers, ensuring social protection and fostering inclusive economic growth are vital. A study by Obviously Sustainable (OS), supported by the Konrad-Adenauer-Stiftung Regional Programme on Energy Security and Climate Change Asia-Pacific (RECAP), examines how Indonesia and Malaysia are navigating these changes.\nThe journey begins with strong social dialogue and active stakeholder participation.\nIndonesia's state electricity company PLN and Malaysia's Petronas have taken significant steps to include workers and community insights in their strategic plans. PLN's collaboration with its labor association and Petronas's implementation of the free, prior and informed consent (FPIC) framework are prime examples of initiatives designed to ensure stakeholders to have significant influence on energy policies.\nFeedback from all relevant stakeholders is crucial for governments and companies to devise strategic plans for an equitable energy transition.

In my decades-long interactions with friends and colleagues from the ASEAN family, I could always find heart-warming friendliness but also uncertainty about China from time to time, which is, unfortunately, exacerbated recently by the misleading smearing of China by a few Western politicians.\nA question of common interest thus emerges: Where is China’s foreign policy heading and what is it aiming for?\nThe Xi Jinping Thought on Diplomacy doctrine would be the most authoritative answer to this question. Since the 18\nth\nNational Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC), the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core has put forward a series of new ideas, new propositions and new initiatives, pointing the direction and providing fundamental guidance for China’s foreign policy.\nChina is committed to building a community with a shared future for mankind, which is the essence of Xi Jinping Thought on Diplomacy.\nPresident Xi points out, “Humankind, by living in the same global village within the same time and space where history and reality meet, has increasingly emerged as an intimate community of shared future. No country could meet the challenges for mankind alone.”\nThe foresight of this vision is once again proved to be true in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.\nTo build a community with a shared future for mankind is the goal of China’s foreign policy. Toward this end, China has been working hard all along, and the most recent effort would be our engagement in international cooperation against COVID-19. As far as ASEAN is concerned, China provided COVID-19-related information in a timely manner, shared experience in control and treatment, and offered a large number of medical supplies.\nThe revival of the regional economy as soon as possible presents another daunting challenge of the day. China has opened or is planning to open “fast-track lanes” for essential personnel exchanges and “green channels” for cargo transportation with Singapore, Myanmar, Indonesia and Malaysia. China and ASEAN countries are also jointly working on COVID-19 vaccine research and development, as well as production. It’s good to know that phase III clinical trials of a vaccine developed in China was rolled out in Indonesia days ago.\nChina is committed to the path of peaceful development. There are people in the West who apply the “Thucydides Trap” or “Kindleberger Trap” to interpret China’s rapid development. Trapped in the belief that “a strong country must seek hegemony”, they demonize China as a potential danger to the world.\nOn the contrary, the Chinese culture holds dear harmony and unity; harmony being the most valuable and harmony without uniformity. Invasion and hegemony-seeking have never been in the Chinese DNA. Facts still speak louder than words. For instance, China’s military expenditure was an average of 1.3 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in the last 10 years, lower than the world average.\nChina has always been dedicated to resolving disputes through negotiations in peace while safeguarding China’s territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests. Guided by the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the spirit of fostering amity and friendship with neighbors, China has properly solved most of the leftover boundary issues step by step with neighboring countries in the past seven decades, and the delineated boundary is about 90 percent of China’s total boundary on land.\nRegarding disputes over the South China Sea, China remains committed to the “dual-track” approach of resolving disputes peacefully through consultation and negotiation between countries directly concerned and of upholding peace and stability in the South China Sea by China and ASEAN countries through joint efforts, including regional rules-making.\nIn 2013, President Xi put forward the major initiatives of the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21\nst\nCentury Maritime Silk Road, which later turned into the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). It focuses on economic cooperation, rather than geopolitical alliance. It is open and inclusive and rests upon extensive consultation, joint contribution and shared benefits.\nSix years on, the initiative is materializing and has become one of the most popular global public goods.&nbsp;It is exciting to see flourishing BRI cooperation between China and ASEAN countries in infrastructure, energy, manufacturing, industrial parks and more. Such cooperation has already delivered real dividends to local development and people.\nPopulism, protectionism, unilateralism and antiglobalization sentiments are proliferating now. Certain countries attribute their&nbsp;domestic problems to external shocks, claiming that they have been “taken advantage of” in the existing trading system.&nbsp;They adopt&nbsp;various measures, including trade,&nbsp;to&nbsp;suppress the development of others, even willfully withdrawing from international treaties and organizations and scapegoating others. Their behavior has seriously violated the multilateral trading system.\nYet despite this, as a firm defender of economic globalization&nbsp;and&nbsp;multilateral trading system, China continues to promote trade and investment liberalization and facilitation, a fair, equitable&nbsp;and transparent system of international economic and trading rules, as well as a more open, connected and integrated global economy.\nThe existing international system was established after World War II under the leadership of United States-led Western countries. Despite its deficiencies and drawbacks, it has played an important role in maintaining world peace and development over the past 70 years. The purpose of reforming the current international system is not to overturn it and start anew, but to adjust and improve it within the overall framework and to make it better adapted&nbsp;to the evolved international landscape.\nChina firmly safeguards&nbsp;the core role of the United Nations in global governance and promotes the building of a more just and equitable&nbsp;international governance system. China honors its commitments on global issues such as climate change&nbsp;by staying on course of green, low-carbon and sustainable development.\nChina will do well only when the world does well and vice versa. On our way toward a community with a shared future, China will work together with ASEAN&nbsp;countries and all&nbsp;other countries in the world to eradicate poverty and seek prosperity and development, to end conflicts and uphold peace,&nbsp;and to bridge the gap between civilizations through exchanges and mutual learning.

(China Daily/File)\nR\necently, the still-raging Omicron variant has led to a sharp surge of infections in East Asia, further distancing us from a future free of COVID-19. Slowed economic growth has made it harder to keep up people’s living standards.\nThe big picture gets gloomier. Traditional security issues are complicated by new ones, giving rise to more uncertainties. Perhaps it has to be admitted that East Asian cooperation has again come to a crossroads in the complex regional and international landscape.\nYet solutions offered by various countries differ. For China, it firmly believes that multilateralism remains the “master key” to challenges faced by East Asia as well as the anchor for regional peace and prosperity.\nPeace and security, a must for development and prosperity, remain the shared aspirations of people in the region. Then what shall and could be done?\nWe regional countries need to serve as the builders and guardians of peace in the region. We need to pursue dialogue instead of confrontation, build partnerships instead of alliances and make concerted efforts to address the various negative factors that might threaten or undermine peace.\nMoreover, we need to champion sincere dialogue, practical cooperation, openness and inclusiveness. We need to fend off security risks and actively explore a regional security architecture.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nHaving stood against power politics and hegemony all along, China is as steadfast as always in safeguarding the enduring peace of the region together with our neighbors. China will never seek hegemony or a sphere of influence, less still will it bully other countries.\nAs victory over COVID-19 and economic recovery remain the common priority for the region’s countries, there is much more we can do together.\nFor instance, it is of paramount importance to stand in solidarity, share information and strengthen joint prevention and control. The strategic significance of vaccines cannot be overemphasized. Cooperation in vaccine research and development, production and distribution requires our concerted endeavors, to make vaccines truly accessible and affordable for everyone.\nOpenness is the sure way for sustained East Asia cooperation. Open regionalism and free trade are conducive to the next phase of regional economic integration. True multilateralism means inclusiveness rather than exclusion, integration rather than decoupling. The sheer obsession with high standards and pursuit of dominance in regional economic agendas, in disregard of openness and inclusiveness, will lead the region nowhere. Free trade prevails when it fits the situation on the ground in East Asia.\nDiversity and inclusiveness are embedded in East Asia’s DNA. Be it the political systems, religions, cultures or models of development, East Asia is&nbsp;well known for its immense diversity, even since ancient times. It has been openness that guides the regional economic integration. It has been coordination and consultation on an equal footing that drives the ASEAN-led regional cooperation. And it has been inclusiveness that underpins an open and non-exclusive East Asia family.\nThose who are preoccupied with an ideology-driven and value-oriented mindset risk severely undermining the foundations of cooperation in East Asia and perhaps would find themselves the least wanted by the region’s countries. Unfortunately, the self-claimed “beacon” would eventually find itself unnecessary and unhelpful in this part of the world, as each and every nation here has its own way of shining.\nWhen it comes to East Asian cooperation, China and ASEAN have been the backbone. China unswervingly supports ASEAN centrality in the regional architecture and unswervingly supports ASEAN in playing a leading role in regional affairs. China is proud to have made significant contributions to East Asian cooperation. The development of China, a major opportunity for the region, is in no way a “challenge” as painted by some other countries.\nEast Asian cooperation has been inexhaustibly powered by the steady and sound growth of China-ASEAN relations. China will, as always, unswervingly see ASEAN as a high priority in its neighborhood diplomacy and unswervingly support ASEAN unity and community building. Last year, President Xi Jinping and leaders of ASEAN member states jointly announced the establishment of a comprehensive strategic partnership between China and ASEAN, identifying fields and measures of cooperation and thus charting the course forward. The new milestone will inject strong impetus into China-ASEAN ties.\nThe tremendous progress of cooperation between China and ASEAN speaks for itself. For instance, our US$878.2 billion of two-way trade in 2021, with a growth rate of 28.1 percent, enables us to remain each other’s largest trading partner. The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) that came into effect on the very first day of 2022 ushers regional free trade into a new era. Major infrastructure projects under the Belt and Road Initiative are delivering real dividends to local people. The China-Laos railway that started operation at the end of last year is serving as a fresh channel of transport between China and ASEAN.\nYet against the prevailing trend of cooperation regionwide, an updated Indo-Pacific Strategy has caught our attention in recent days. Dominated by the Cold War mentality, the strategy uses an easy excuse of the “China threat” and is in pursuit of geopolitical rivalry. Be it the five objectives or the action plan, people do not need to make an effort to discover its hidden agenda of containing China and defending hegemony.\nOn paper, the “strategy” is about a free and open region. In reality, it is busy with building regional blocs such as AUKUS and the Quad.\nOn the one hand, it talks about bolstered regional security. On the other, it is about reinforcing deterrence by helping an ally with nuclear submarines and risking the region with potential nuclear proliferation.\nOn the one hand, it looks to regional prosperity. Yet on the other, it undermines the ASEAN-centered regional cooperation architecture by driving a wedge among countries with its attempt to instigate confrontation, thus seriously threatening the fruits and prospects of regional cooperation.\nAt the crossroad, it is worth pondering, more than ever, the course and direction ahead. One thing is for sure. China will continue to keep up with the trend of the times, remain focused on improving people’s livelihoods and safeguarding regional peace and development, guided by the spirit of building a global community with a shared future, China will remain as steadfast as ever in championing multilateralism and working together with ASEAN toward an even brighter future of East Asian cooperation.\n&nbsp;***\nThe writer is Chinese ambassador to ASEAN.\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nRelated Articles\nMultilateral system in crisis\nRubio pick signals a Trump China policy that could go beyond tariffs\nA new journey in China-Indonesia relationship: Building a shared future\nPrabowo’s ‘good neighbor’ policy takes Indonesia beyond Southeast Asia\nReclaiming RCEP to elevate ASEAN centrality in trade\nRelated Article\nMultilateral system in crisis\nRubio pick signals a Trump China policy that could go beyond tariffs\nA new journey in China-Indonesia relationship: Building a shared future\nPrabowo’s ‘good neighbor’ policy takes Indonesia beyond Southeast Asia\nReclaiming RCEP to elevate ASEAN centrality in trade\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nMore in Opinion\nView more\nAcademia\nThe bottom-up wave of democratic rejuvenation\nAcademia\nPolice brutality: Fundamental problems in the institution\nAcademia\nFree trade deals increase Indonesian imports more than exports\nHighlight\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEditorial\nNarrow margin\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nThe Latest\nView more\nEconomy\nRI identifies 29 potential nuclear power plant sites\nEconomy\nChinese authorities are considering a weaker yuan as Trump trade risks loom, sources say\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia commences evacuation of 37 citizens in Damascus\nTech\nUS finalizes $6.1 billion Micron chip-making subsidy\nArchipelago\nTwo foreign visitors killed in tree collapse in Monkey Forest\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEconomy\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources\nRegulations\nBullion bank to launch in first half of next year, Airlangga says"

REUTERS/Adnan Abidi (Reuters/ADNAN ABIDI)\nVersi Bahasa Indonesia\n“\nVasudhaiva Kutumbakam”\n– these two words capture a deep philosophy. It means “the world is one family”. This is an all-embracing outlook that encourages us to progress as one universal family, transcending borders, languages, and ideologies.\nDuring India’s Group of 20 presidency, this has translated into a call for human-centric progress. As one Earth, we are coming together to nurture our planet. As one family, we support each other in the pursuit of growth. And we move together towards a shared future – one future – which is an undeniable truth in these interconnected times.\nThe post-pandemic world order is very different from the world before it. There are three important changes, among others.\nFirst, there is a growing realization that a shift away from a gross domestic product (GDP)-centric view of the world to a human-centric view is needed.&nbsp;\nSecond, the world is recognizing the importance of resilience and reliability in global supply chains.\nThird, there is a collective call for boosting multilateralism through the reform of global institutions.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nOur G20 presidency has played the role of a catalyst in these shifts.&nbsp;\nIn December 2022, when we took over the presidency from Indonesia, I had written that a mindset shift must be catalyzed by the G20. This was especially needed in the context of mainstreaming the marginalized aspirations of developing countries, the Global South and Africa.\nThe Voice of Global South Summit, which witnessed participation from 125 countries, was one of the foremost initiatives under our presidency. It was an important exercise to gather inputs and ideas from the Global South. Further, our presidency has not only seen the largest-ever participation from African countries but has also pushed for the inclusion of the African Union as a permanent member of the G20.\nAn interconnected world means our challenges across domains are interlinked. This is the midway year of the 2030 Agenda and many are noting with great concern that the progress on Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is off-track. The G20 2023 Action Plan on Accelerating Progress on SDGs will spearhead the future direction of the G20 toward implementing SDGs.\nIn India, living in harmony with nature has been a norm since ancient times and we have been contributing our share towards climate action even in modern times.&nbsp;\nMany countries of the Global South are at various stages of development and climate action must be a complementary pursuit. Ambitions for climate action must be matched with actions on climate finance and the transfer of technology.&nbsp;\nWe believe there is a need to move away from a purely restrictive attitude of what should not be done, to a more constructive attitude focusing on what can be done to fight climate change.\nThe Chennai HLPs for a Sustainable and Resilient Blue Economy focus on keeping our oceans healthy.&nbsp;\nA global ecosystem for clean and green hydrogen will emerge from our presidency, along with a Green Hydrogen Innovation Centre.\nIn 2015, we launched the International Solar Alliance. Now, through the Global Biofuels Alliance, we will support the world to enable energy transitions in tune with the benefits of a circular economy.\nDemocratizing climate action is the best way to impart momentum to the movement. Just as individuals make daily decisions based on their long-term health, they can make lifestyle decisions based on the impact on the planet’s long-term health. Just like yoga became a global mass movement for wellness, we have also nudged the world with Lifestyles for Sustainable Environment (LiFE).\nDue to the impact of climate change, ensuring food and nutritional security will be crucial. Millets, or\nShree Anna\n, can help with this while also boosting climate-smart agriculture. In the International Year of Millets, we have taken millets to global palates. The Deccan High Level Principles on Food Security and Nutrition is also helpful in this direction.\nTechnology is transformative but it also needs to be made inclusive. In the past, the benefits of technological advancements have not benefited all sections of society equally. India, over the last few years, has shown how technology can be leveraged to narrow inequalities, rather than widen them.&nbsp;\nFor instance, the billions across the world that remain unbanked, or lack digital identities, can be financially included through digital public infrastructure (DPI). The solutions we have built using our DPI have now been recognized globally. Now, through the G20, we will help developing countries adapt, build, and scale DPI to unlock the power of inclusive growth.\nThat India is the fastest-growing large economy is no accident. Our simple, scalable and sustainable solutions have empowered the vulnerable and the marginalized to lead our development story. From space to sports, economy to entrepreneurship, Indian women have taken the lead in various sectors. They have shifted the narrative from the development of women to women-led development. Our G20 presidency is working on bridging the gender digital divide, reducing labor force participation gaps and enabling a larger role for women in leadership and decision-making.\nFor India, the G20 presidency is not merely a high-level diplomatic endeavor. As the mother of democracy and a model of diversity, we opened the doors of this experience to the world.\nToday, accomplishing things at scale is a quality that is associated with India. The G20 presidency is no exception. It has become a people-driven movement. Over 200 meetings will have been organized in 60 Indian cities across the length and breadth of our nation, hosting nearly 100,000 delegates from 125 countries by the end of our term. No presidency has ever encompassed such a vast and diverse geographical expanse.\nIt is one thing to hear about India’s demography, democracy, diversity and development from someone else.

(Antara/Fitra Ashari)\nO\nn Aug. 8, as we celebrated the 56\nth\nASEAN Day, the ASEAN Online Sale Day opened. This is the first regional online shopping event held by the bloc, and it provided a platform for ASEAN enterprises, especially micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), to promote their products through e-commerce channels.\nA wide range of electronics, handicrafts and fashion products from ASEAN countries were on display, highlighting the vibrancy of ASEAN businesses and conveying the message that ASEAN is committed to developing cross-border e-commerce.\nOnline shopping, including international online shopping, has long been an integral part of daily life in China. Many ASEAN products, such as coffee and shrimp chips from Indonesia and durian from Thailand, are hot sellers on China's e-commerce platforms.\nThis year, the “Brand and Quality Online Shopping Festival” held by China has created the “ASEAN offerings” activity, which promotes ASEAN’s specialty products on the Chinese market through special online events and live streaming.\nThe digital economy has changed the way people live and represents the future of the global economy. For developing countries, the digital economy is an opportunity to enliven the consumer market, create new growth points, empower industrial transformation and upgrading, give rise to new business models and promote high-quality development.\nChina and ASEAN are both highlands of digital economy development. China is a leader in the digital economy, at the forefront of digital infrastructure, smart cities and digital government resources, as well as several world-class digital enterprises.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nIn 2022, China's digital economy reached 50.2 trillion yuan (US$6.9 trillion), ranking second globally, and the country's online retail sales amounted to 13.79 trillion yuan, ranking first in the world.\nASEAN's digital economy has seen rapid developing in recent years, showing great potential, with the accelerated rollout of digital platforms and digital technologies in many countries, and booming development of industries such as e-commerce, transportation applications and online services. By the end of June 2022, half of the world's 10 fastest-growing countries in terms of online retail sales, including the top three, were ASEAN members. ASEAN is expected to be among the world's top five digital economies by 2025.\nChina and ASEAN are natural partners in digital economy development. The ASEAN market has already attracted some leading Chinese digital enterprises, including e-commerce platforms such as Alibaba, Tencent and Jingdong, mobile payment enterprises such as Ant Group, digital information enterprises such as Huawei and ZTE and some courier and logistics enterprises.\nThese Chinese enterprises have cooperated with partners in ASEAN countries to promote advanced technologies and mature business models within ASEAN, and they have assisted Southeast Asia in building digital economic ecosystems that promote the rapid rise of local digital enterprises such as Shopee, Lazada and Tokopedia, which has greatly driven the development of ASEAN's digital industry and the construction of its digital interconnectivity.\nBecause of geographic proximity, people-to-people affinity, integrated economies and highly complementary industries, China and ASEAN members are highly compatible in terms of digital economy development planning and industrial needs. The digital economy will be a new “blue ocean” in China-ASEAN economic and trade cooperation, creating many opportunities.\nAt the ASEAN-China Special Summit to Commemorate the 30\nth\nanniversary of ASEAN-China Dialogue Relations in 2021, China and ASEAN established a comprehensive strategic partnership, and Chinese President Xi Jinping emphasized that China would expand cooperation in the digital economy with ASEAN.\nSince then, the two sides have been accelerating digital cooperation, gradually improving strategic alignment and speeding up the implementation of the Initiative on Building ASEAN-China Partnership on Digital Economy. More than half of ASEAN member states have signed bilateral e-commerce cooperation memorandums with China and established the \"Silk Road E-commerce\" cooperation mechanism.\nNew chapters on the digital economy that are included in the ongoing negotiations on the Version 3.0 China-ASEAN Free Trade Area, and an initiative on deepening e-commerce cooperation will be published at the upcoming China-ASEAN Leaders’ Summit.\nIn addition, China and the Southeast Asian bloc have utilized platforms such as the China-ASEAN Expo and the China-ASEAN Information Port to vigorously promote cooperation on projects in the fields of digital government, digital enterprises, digital industries and new communications.\nThis year marks the 10\nth\nanniversary of President Xi’s proposal to build a closer China-ASEAN community with a shared future through the Belt and Road Initiative. China will use this as an opportunity to plan for cooperation in areas such as the digital economy with ASEAN and other countries involved in the Belt and Road Initiative.\nThis year, Indonesia, as ASEAN's rotating chair, has adopted the theme \"ASEAN Matters: Epicentrum of Growth\" and chosen digital economy cooperation as one of the priority agendas. At this historic juncture linking past achievements with prospects, China and ASEAN should work together to embrace and promote the new era of the digital economy.\nWe need to further strengthen the synergy of digital development strategies, enhance digital connectivity and build an integrated China-ASEAN digital market. We need to promote an exchange of experience and capacity-building training and improve rulemaking by agreeing on high-level digital rules.\nWe should push for lower tariffs, more efficient customs clearance, more connected payment methods and faster logistics and transportation so that more ordinary people and enterprises can enjoy the benefits of digital economy development.\nNext month, Jakarta will host the bloc’s leaders’ meetings on East Asia cooperation. We are ready to work with ASEAN countries at the meetings to promote fruitful results and push China-ASEAN digital economy cooperation to a new level.\n&nbsp;***\nThe author is Chinese Ambassador to ASEAN.\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nRelated Articles\nChina to curbs exports of key chipmaking components to US\nChina lifts final bans on Australian red meat as trade row nears end\nConfronting the climate crisis: Water as a lever for climate action\nASEAN, Canada work together for health security\nNo more cop-outs\nRelated Article\nChina to curbs exports of key chipmaking components to US\nChina lifts final bans on Australian red meat as trade row nears end\nConfronting the climate crisis: Water as a lever for climate action\nASEAN, Canada work together for health security\nNo more cop-outs\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nMore in Opinion\nView more\nAcademia\nThe bottom-up wave of democratic rejuvenation\nAcademia\nPolice brutality: Fundamental problems in the institution\nAcademia\nFree trade deals increase Indonesian imports more than exports\nHighlight\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEditorial\nNarrow margin\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nThe Latest\nView more\nEconomy\nChinese authorities are considering a weaker yuan as Trump trade risks loom, sources say\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia commences evacuation of 37 citizens in Damascus\nTech\nUS finalizes $6.1 billion Micron chip-making subsidy\nArchipelago\nTwo foreign visitors killed in tree collapse in Monkey Forest\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEconomy\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources\nRegulations\nBullion bank to launch in first half of next year, Airlangga says\nMiddle East and Africa\nAirline pilots, crews voice concerns about Middle East routes"

(The Straits Times/ANN/Lianhe Zaobao)\nA\nmong the upcoming annual post-ministerial conferences of the ASEAN Foreign Ministers’ Meeting, the ASEAN-China Foreign Ministers’ Meeting will be one of the most important events.\nAs President Xi Jinping pointed out in his congratulatory letter to the opening ceremony of ASEAN-China Year of Media Exchanges in February, ASEAN-China relations have entered a new stage of all-round development, which I believe can be characterized by the following points.\nFirst, the pathway of the development of ASEAN-China relations is clearer. Leaders of both sides are always in the driver’s seat steering the development of ASEAN-China relations in the right direction. President Xi proposed to build a higher-level ASEAN-China strategic partnership and a closer ASEAN-China community with a shared future, charting the course of long-term development of these relations.\nSecond, strategic mutual trust is deeper. Leaders of China and ASEAN maintain frequent high-level exchanges. Besides intensive bilateral visits, leaders of the 10 ASEAN countries and the deputy secretary-general of the ASEAN Secretariat attended the second Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation last April, demonstrating the deep mutual trust between the two sides. We remain committed to resolving differences through dialogue and consultation and getting rid of external interference to jointly safeguard peace and stability in the South China Sea.\nWe have accelerated Code of Conduct (COC) consultations to jointly explore the formulation of regional rules at sea. We also held the first joint maritime exercise, as part of our efforts to enhance defense and security cooperation. Thanks to these concerted endeavors, the strategic mutual trust between the two sides has risen to an unprecedented new height.\nThird, economic and trade cooperation is growing faster. Against the backdrop of sluggish global growth and rising trade protectionism, ASEAN-China trade volume hit a record high in 2018, reaching US$587.8 billion, with a growth rate of 14.1 percent year-on-year. In the first half of 2019, landmark progress was achieved, with ASEAN overtaking the United States to become China’s second-largest trading partner.\nTrade volume reached $291.85 billion in the first six months and is expected to exceed $600 billion by the end of the year. The industrial sectors in China and ASEAN, which are at difference stages of development, are increasingly complementary to each other.\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nRelated Articles\nDevelopments of Indonesia’s OECD accession journey\nIs Beijing undermining Indonesia’s free and active foreign policy?\nBali airport initiator signs HoA with Chinese company\nPrabowo needs US-model national security council\nPresident Prabowo calls Trump ahead of Biden meeting\nRelated Article\nDevelopments of Indonesia’s OECD accession journey\nIs Beijing undermining Indonesia’s free and active foreign policy?\nBali airport initiator signs HoA with Chinese company\nPrabowo needs US-model national security council\nPresident Prabowo calls Trump ahead of Biden meeting\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nMore in Academia\nView more\nAcademia\nThe bottom-up wave of democratic rejuvenation\nAcademia\nPolice brutality: Fundamental problems in the institution\nAcademia\nFree trade deals increase Indonesian imports more than exports\nHighlight\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEditorial\nNarrow margin\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nThe Latest\nView more\nEconomy\nRI identifies 29 potential nuclear power plant sites\nEconomy\nChinese authorities are considering a weaker yuan as Trump trade risks loom, sources say\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia commences evacuation of 37 citizens in Damascus\nTech\nUS finalizes $6.1 billion Micron chip-making subsidy\nArchipelago\nTwo foreign visitors killed in tree collapse in Monkey Forest\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEconomy\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources\nRegulations\nBullion bank to launch in first half of next year, Airlangga says"

The railway is to stretch about 142 kilometers from Jakarta to Bandung. (The Jakarta Post/Wienda Parwitasari)\nT\nhe 142.3-kilometer Jakarta-Bandung high-speed railway project is expected to become an excellent model of cooperation between China and Indonesia. When Indonesia chose China to carry out the project in September 2014, it was optimistically estimated that the megaproject, which would reportedly cost US$6.07 billion, would be completed by 2019.&nbsp;\nHowever, the project later faced many hurdles and was delayed for more than two years, raising the cost by 23 percent, according to Indonesian officials. This is a sensitive issue for both Indonesia and China. There is no doubt about China’s technology mastery, but in terms of feasibility study and the knowledge about local sensitivity, China needs to pay more attention.\nChinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi assured visiting Maritime and Investment Coordinating Minister Luhut Pandjaitan on June 5 that the high-speed railway project would be completed in 2022 — a big relief for both sides. Hopefully, the two countries can reach a compromise on how the cost overrun can be shared. The success of the project will be a milestone for the two countries and prove that economic cooperation is indeed mutually beneficial.\nHowever, some tend to view China from a hostile perspective because of past experiences. Jakarta froze diplomatic ties with Beijing in the wake of an aborted coup attempt blamed on the Indonesian Communist Party (PKI) in 1965. Diplomatic relations were normalized on Aug. 8, 1990. China is moving closer to becoming the world’s most powerful economy, and this has raised anxiety globally. It is just a natural phenomenon that has happened to other countries, such as the United States and Japan.\nWith President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo already making plans to accompany Chinese President Xi Jinping on a trial run of the railway in 2022, when the latter is set to visit Indonesia to attend a Group of 20 summit, it is a strong show of assurance that there will be no more delays and that the project will be completed as planned — at any cost.\nThe President reportedly chose China over Japan for the project because he had learned from his experience as a businessman that Japan tended to be stingy in its transferring of technology to Indonesia. In 2014, it was almost certain that Japan would win the railway project because it had finished its feasibility study with a very cheap, long-term loan.\nJapan offered to cover 75 percent of the cost in long-term and soft loans. Its interest rate was just 0.1 percent and the loan term was 40 years. Repayment would start 11 years after the railway started operation. The project was included in Japan’s Official Development Assistance (ODA) program. What bothered Jokowi was Japan’s requirement that the loan be based on a government-to-government agreement, while China offered a business-to-business scheme.\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nRelated Articles\nChina, Indonesia open a new chapter of building a community with a shared future\nAsia’s future in a challenging world\nChina’s diplomacy: Building a community with a shared future for mankind\nWhoosh prices to fluctuate with customer demand\nHow BRI can give impetus to development in Indonesia\nRelated Article\nChina, Indonesia open a new chapter of building a community with a shared future\nAsia’s future in a challenging world\nChina’s diplomacy: Building a community with a shared future for mankind\nWhoosh prices to fluctuate with customer demand\nHow BRI can give impetus to development in Indonesia\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nMore in Academia\nView more\nAcademia\nThe bottom-up wave of democratic rejuvenation\nAcademia\nPolice brutality: Fundamental problems in the institution\nAcademia\nFree trade deals increase Indonesian imports more than exports\nHighlight\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEditorial\nNarrow margin\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nThe Latest\nView more\nEconomy\nRI identifies 29 potential nuclear power plant sites\nEconomy\nChinese authorities are considering a weaker yuan as Trump trade risks loom, sources say\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia commences evacuation of 37 citizens in Damascus\nTech\nUS finalizes $6.1 billion Micron chip-making subsidy\nArchipelago\nTwo foreign visitors killed in tree collapse in Monkey Forest\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEconomy\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources\nRegulations\nBullion bank to launch in first half of next year, Airlangga says"

(REUTERS/Aly Song)\nInstead of being hit by the pandemic, Asian countries are more united than ever before.\nThe novel coronavirus pandemic has cast doubt on the advancement of globalization. Some say that the international community will be further divided. Others predict that globalization is coming to an end. Such suggestions are irrational as we do not really have a choice but to strengthen cooperation, whether dealing with the threat of the virus or the challenges of the economic downturn. It is thus encouraging that Asian countries are strengthening international cooperation in the face of the strong headwinds.\nAsia was the first region to be hit by the pandemic. In addition to China, Thailand reported the first confirmed case as early as Jan. 8, followed by Japan, South Korea, Singapore, Malaysia and some other Asian countries. In general, cases were reported in Asia a week earlier than in European countries and the United States.\nThe responses of Asian countries have amazed the world. By mid-April, infected patients accounted for a much smaller percentage in Asia relative to some countries in other regions, indicating a more effective containment of the virus. While the mortality rate in major East Asian countries has been below 3 percent and even 1 percent in Singapore, other regions have a fatality rate of more than 5 percent or even 10 percent.\nWhy have Asian countries been more successful in containing the virus? For one thing, Asian governments have taken this dynamic situation very seriously and responded with swift, stringent and effective measures. In addition, nurtured by the culture of putting a premium on collective interest, social discipline and public order, people in Asia have done their bit to pull through this trying time, including complying with the prevention and control measures introduced by their governments.&nbsp;\nMost importantly, the fight against this scourge has been bolstered by the time-honored tradition and fine spirit of solidarity between Asian countries, especially in times of crisis. When the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) broke out in 2002-03, members of ASEAN-China, Japan and South Korea (10+3) came together to cooperate closely, sharing information and helping one another. Facing COVID-19, Asian countries have intensified their efforts, not just by sharing experiences and learning from one another but also by maintaining trade, keeping supply chains intact and donating medical and other emergency supplies needed to fight the virus.\nCooperation and coordination within the 10+3 and ASEAN-China (10+1) mechanisms are cases in point. On Feb. 20, the China-ASEAN Special Foreign Ministers' Meeting on fighting COVID-19 exchanged views on strengthening synergy between the health, quarantine, transportation and border control agencies of China and ASEAN, and discussed China's proposal to establish a China-ASEAN liaison mechanism for public health emergencies as well as China-ASEAN reserve centers for epidemic-control provisions.\nIn March, China, Japan and South Korea held special videoconferences on jointly responding to COVID-19 and agreed to, among other things, explore a joint prevention and control mechanism to effectively prevent the cross-border spread of the epidemic, seek mutually acceptable solutions to maintain necessary people-to-people exchanges related to economic cooperation and trade and stabilize the industrial chain and supply chain of the three countries.\nOn April 14, the 10+3 mechanism held a special summit and issued a joint statement outlining 18 goals as well as an action plan for further cooperation during and after the outbreak.\nThese are all great achievements from the perspective of an international observer.\nIt is fair to say that Asia has been a respectful community of shared interest and cooperation in the face of the sudden threat and subsequent challenges. For those who are overly pessimistic, the performance of Asian countries speaks volumes.\nOver the past decades, Asian countries have played more of a participating role in international institutions and mechanisms. Now with our region and the entire world facing not only a prominent health crisis but also the prospect of economic recession, and the erosion of social cohesion and multilateralism, there is a strong need to improve global governance. It is imperative that countries respond resolutely and firmly rise to these challenges and that international cooperation be enhanced. Undoubtedly, Asian countries can play a constructive or leading role.\nFirst, the existing regional cooperation mechanisms should be further integrated, such as ASEAN-China-Japan-South Korea, China-ASEAN, China-Japan-South Korea and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership.\nSecond, regional cooperation in Asia has to cope with the political challenges that plague our times, such as populism, nationalism, power politics and great power competition. Therefore, we must seek solutions to wealth inequality, the imbalance in international trade and the global economy, immigration and cultural conflicts while building the widest consensus on the new stage of globalization among different countries, ethnic groups and classes.\nFinally, Asian cooperation needs solid support in various fields involving agricultural products, aquatic products, health, financial trade, tourism, cultural industries, science and technology, energy, environment and sustainable development. Flexible and pragmatic policies under a comprehensive functional cooperation mechanism must be employed to deal with problems in development.\nChina is a big country in Asia that keeps learning and growing. It has not only gained great support from the neighboring countries but also learned its lessons. China sets a diplomatic goal of building a community with a shared future for mankind and continues to promote the Belt and Road Initiative, which is actually shared political concepts among Asian countries. A more capable and committed China will surely be an asset to Asia and the world.\nOver the past decades, the world has held special expectations for Asia, and most people are impressed with Asia's economic rise. Yet today, Asia represents not only a promising economic powerhouse of the global economy but a major opportunity for the promotion of human progress with its traditions, wisdom and values, especially in the political and cultural aspects.\nAt this critical moment in human history, will Asia overcome the challenges and achieve this? Taking a look at the wisdom and spirit shown in fighting against the virus, there is no doubt about it.\n***\nHu Zhengyue is former Chinese ambassador to Malaysia.

China’s concrete actions speak volumes of its resolve to promote the building of a community with a shared future for mankind. President Xi Jinping attaches great importance to the international cooperation in COVID-19 prevention and control and has kept close contact with other world leaders.\nChina’s efficient and effective head-of-state diplomacy plays a unique and significant role at the unusual moment in promoting cooperation between China and other countries and deepening friendship between the Chinese people and peoples in the rest of the world.\nChina has donated US$20 million to the World Health Organization in support of disease prevention and control, in particular the public health systems of other developing countries. China has undertaken an enormous national mobilization to speed up production in response to the huge demand of global medical supplies.\nThe production capacity of masks has grown by five times in a short period of time, and the output of masks now exceeds 100 million per day. The production of protective gear and forehead thermometers, among other urgently needed supplies, has grown rapidly. Test kits are quickly being developed and put into mass production.\nWhile making every effort to combat the disease at home, China has endeavored to overcome difficulties and provide substantial assistance to other countries and regions where COVID-19 is taking a toll.\nChina and ASEAN member states have maintained close cooperation since the outbreak began, which demonstrates our traditional friendship of standing together in times of difficulties.\nIn recent days, China has been increasing assistance to ASEAN member states where COVID-19 has spread widely. On March 21, 100,000 test kits, 100,000 surgical masks, 10,000 N-95 masks and 10,000 sets of personal protective equipment donated by the Chinese government to the Philippines arrived in Manila. Foreign Secretary Teodoro Lopez Locsin, who attended the handover ceremony, called it “tremendous help and invaluable support from China”.\nOn March 23, seven medical experts, the first medical team sent by the Chinese government to an ASEAN member state, together with medical supplies, arrived in Phnom Penh.\nOn the same day, the first batch of medical supplies from China arrived in Indonesia. More assistance to Indonesia and the ASEAN Secretariat has also reached Jakarta.\nApart from the official assistance provided by the Chinese government, some local Chinese administrations, private entities and individuals have also extended a helping hand to ASEAN member states by donating a large amount of medical supplies and equipment. The quick assistance delivered through a streamlined process fully reflects the close bonds and deep friendship between our peoples.\nAt this critical moment when the world unites as one and fights the pandemic, there are also a few people with ulterior motives out there who deliberately link the novel coronavirus to China and stigmatize China nonstop, which the Chinese people are indignant at and strongly opposed to. The origin of the novel coronavirus is a matter of science that requires a scientific and professional assessment.\nThere is a clear consensus within the WHO and the international community that a virus shouldn’t be linked to any specific country or region and that such stigmatization should be rejected. What those people have done will not help with international cooperation but only waste precious time that should be used to curb the pandemic, and it inflicts real harm on their own people and international cooperation.\nThe pandemic is still spreading worldwide. In the face of this severe, common test of mankind, China acts upon its profound convictions that mutual and timely assistance is of paramount importance and that kindness and gifts must be repaid.\nIn this spirit, China will continue to work with ASEAN and others in the international community to meet the challenge head-on, protect the health and safety of our people and strive for a community with a shared future for mankind.\n***\nAmbassador of the People’s Republic of China to ASEAN\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nRelated Articles\nSingapore 'deeply invested' in Indonesia’s success, PM says\nChinese premier in Hanoi agrees to boost ties with Vietnam\nInbound tourism soars to highest level since 2019: BPS\nPrabowo cozies up to Turkey on defense after Australia visit&nbsp;\nJapan to present low-carbon projects for ASEAN, Indonesia\nRelated Article\nSingapore 'deeply invested' in Indonesia’s success, PM says\nChinese premier in Hanoi agrees to boost ties with Vietnam\nInbound tourism soars to highest level since 2019: BPS\nPrabowo cozies up to Turkey on defense after Australia visit&nbsp;\nJapan to present low-carbon projects for ASEAN, Indonesia\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nMore in Academia\nView more\nAcademia\nThe bottom-up wave of democratic rejuvenation\nAcademia\nPolice brutality: Fundamental problems in the institution\nAcademia\nFree trade deals increase Indonesian imports more than exports\nHighlight\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEditorial\nNarrow margin\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nThe Latest\nView more\nEconomy\nRI identifies 29 potential nuclear power plant sites\nEconomy\nChinese authorities are considering a weaker yuan as Trump trade risks loom, sources say\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia commences evacuation of 37 citizens in Damascus\nTech\nUS finalizes $6.1 billion Micron chip-making subsidy\nArchipelago\nTwo foreign visitors killed in tree collapse in Monkey Forest\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEconomy\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources\nRegulations\nBullion bank to launch in first half of next year, Airlangga says"

They also agreed to uphold open regionalism in Asia. And China reaffirmed its support for ASEAN centrality. All these are big deals.\nIf read carefully, the joint statement also mentioned documents signed by the two countries to sell Indonesian pineapples in the Chinese market. It may seem insignificant to some, but the fact that the business of a fruit needed to be taken care of during a meeting between the two heads of state points to their seriousness about strengthening economic and trade ties at all levels.\nThe aspiration for economic advancement is inherent in the planned paths of both countries. Indonesia is on its way to achieving Vision 2045, the country’s roadmap to becoming a developed nation and one of the world’s five biggest economies with near-zero poverty by the centenary of its independence.\nFrom the expansive stretch of railways on Sumatra to the enterprise of moving to a new capital, the nation’s desire to achieve prosperity is palpable. And China’s ambition of an innovative, digital and balanced economy is equally manifest in its 14\nth\nfive-year plan.\nPlus, foreign invasion or occupation are not distant memories for people of both nations. A shared sense is that peace was a hard-fought victory, won through blood and toil, that will be cherished every day and certainly not squandered away. And what is a better way to do that than by focusing on developing the economy so that everyone lives in affluence?\nThus, the joint statement issued during Jokowi’s stay in Beijing addressed development issues with surgical precision. On the macro-level, it made sure that the two sides meet wherever they can in their respective national schemes and their thinking on regional blueprint: it stressed synergy of China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and Indonesia’s Global Maritime Fulcrum; also, cooperation between the ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific and BRI.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nThen, apart from pineapples, it chopped up other details on railways, industrial parks, vaccines and fisheries under Indonesia’s National Fish Barn project, among other things, and organized them in an orderly fashion.\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nRelated Articles\nXi says trade war with US will have 'no winners'\nAnalysis: Prabowo, Jokowi pull strings in regional head elections\nPrabowo’s new approach to RI-China relations\nPresident Prabowo says he will safeguard sovereignty in South China Sea\nPeru's Chancay: China's megaport of entry to South America\nRelated Article\nXi says trade war with US will have 'no winners'\nAnalysis: Prabowo, Jokowi pull strings in regional head elections\nPrabowo’s new approach to RI-China relations\nPresident Prabowo says he will safeguard sovereignty in South China Sea\nPeru's Chancay: China's megaport of entry to South America\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nMore in Opinion\nView more\nAcademia\nThe bottom-up wave of democratic rejuvenation\nAcademia\nPolice brutality: Fundamental problems in the institution\nAcademia\nFree trade deals increase Indonesian imports more than exports\nHighlight\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEditorial\nNarrow margin\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nThe Latest\nView more\nEconomy\nRI identifies 29 potential nuclear power plant sites\nEconomy\nChinese authorities are considering a weaker yuan as Trump trade risks loom, sources say\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia commences evacuation of 37 citizens in Damascus\nTech\nUS finalizes $6.1 billion Micron chip-making subsidy\nArchipelago\nTwo foreign visitors killed in tree collapse in Monkey Forest\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEconomy\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources\nRegulations\nBullion bank to launch in first half of next year, Airlangga says"

(Reuters/Pool/Sputnik/Sergey Bobylev)\nR\necently, the 22nd Meeting of the Council of Heads of State of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) was successfully held in Samarkand, Uzbekistan, where Chinese President Xi Jinping, together with leaders of other SCO member states, reviewed achievements, summarized experience, and drew new blueprints. During this period, openness and inclusiveness were the frequently mentioned keywords.\nOpenness and inclusiveness have contributed to the vigorous development of the SCO. Founded over 20 years ago, SCO member states have always upheld the Shanghai Spirit featuring mutual trust, mutual benefit, equality, consultation, respect for the diversity of civilizations and pursuit of common development, committed to political trust, mutually beneficial cooperation, equality, openness and inclusiveness, and equity and justice, and promoted “dialogue and cooperation in an interconnected world” as Uzbek President Shavkat Mirziyoyev wrote in his op-ed recently published in\nThe Jakarta Post.\nThe SCO member states, with their diverse national conditions and cultures, have been able to stay together and attract the attention and the application for joining of more like-minded countries because of their adherence to open and inclusive multilateralism. This is the important foundation for the SCO’s development and growth.\nOpenness and inclusiveness are also the secrets of successful East Asia cooperation. Since the establishment of the East Asia regional cooperation mechanism, all parties have made remarkable development achievements by adhering to the vision of peace, development, independence and inclusiveness, and upholding open regionalism.\nASEAN countries have created and led the East Asia regional cooperation mechanism, and also promoted the formation of the ASEAN development philosophy and ways of interaction featuring a development-first approach, mutually beneficial cooperation and mutual respect.\nChina has always supported ASEAN’s community building, supported the ASEAN-centered regional cooperation architecture. Last year, China and ASEAN established the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership. With the concerted efforts of the two sides to build a peaceful, safe and secure, prosperous, beautiful and amicable home together, China-ASEAN cooperation will certainly continue to be at the forefront of the times and offer strong guidance to East Asia cooperation.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nChina will always uphold the spirit of openness and inclusiveness in regional and international cooperation. As an advocate, a participant, and a beneficiary of global development cooperation, China will always pursue an opening-up strategy of win-win cooperation, and actively participate in regional and global cooperation. In response to the common and urgent issues of development and security faced by the international community,\nChina has proposed the Global Development Initiative and the Global Security Initiative, calling on all countries to stay true to the vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security and build a balanced, effective and sustainable security architecture, and also calling on all parties to foster global development partnership, and achieve more robust, greener and more balanced global development, thus effectively promoting international cooperation and addressing common challenges.\nChina is willing to take the implementation of relevant initiatives as an opportunity to deepen solidarity and cooperation with ASEAN and other relevant parties, practice multilateralism with a clear attitude and firm actions, and promote the building of a community with a shared future for mankind.\nSeclusion and isolation will only lead to rigidity and backwardness, while inclusiveness and openness will bring mutual benefit and win-win results. In order to maintain its own hegemony, the United States is engaged in geopolitical contests and bloc confrontation, which goes against the spirit of openness and inclusiveness.\nWe should remain highly vigilant in this regard and prevent it from hindering the international community’s joint response to challenges, the healthy development of international relations and transformation of the international order toward justice and equity.\nAs a Chinese saying goes, “Advancing with the times opens up new horizons”. China is ready to work with regional countries to uphold open and inclusive regionalism and jointly promote peace, stability, development and prosperity in the region and the world.\n&nbsp;***\nThe author is Chinese Ambassador to ASEAN.\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nRelated Articles\nPrabowo’s great power politics pivot takes center stage\nA new journey in China-Indonesia relationship: Building a shared future\nPrabowo calls meeting with regional heads\nSampoerna’s tobacco partnership program boosts Wonogiri economy\nGermany bets on India to reduce reliance on China\nRelated Article\nPrabowo’s great power politics pivot takes center stage\nA new journey in China-Indonesia relationship: Building a shared future\nPrabowo calls meeting with regional heads\nSampoerna’s tobacco partnership program boosts Wonogiri economy\nGermany bets on India to reduce reliance on China\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nMore in Opinion\nView more\nAcademia\nThe bottom-up wave of democratic rejuvenation\nAcademia\nPolice brutality: Fundamental problems in the institution\nAcademia\nFree trade deals increase Indonesian imports more than exports\nHighlight\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEditorial\nNarrow margin\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nThe Latest\nView more\nEconomy\nRI identifies 29 potential nuclear power plant sites\nEconomy\nChinese authorities are considering a weaker yuan as Trump trade risks loom, sources say\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia commences evacuation of 37 citizens in Damascus\nTech\nUS finalizes $6.1 billion Micron chip-making subsidy\nArchipelago\nTwo foreign visitors killed in tree collapse in Monkey Forest\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEconomy\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources\nRegulations\nBullion bank to launch in first half of next year, Airlangga says"

(REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton)\nC\nOVID-19 has brought formidable threats to the life and health of people all over the world. Amid the fierce struggle between the human race and a major global epidemic, unity and cooperation is more needed than ever.\nThe novel coronavirus is a new type of virus. Our knowledge of it is growing yet still limited. China, too, in acquiring an understanding of the virus, went through a painful process, which is not exceptional in the pursuit of honest knowledge and scientific facts.\nDuring this process, China has been actively engaging in international cooperation in controlling and combating the pandemic with the spirit of openness, transparency and responsibility – China identified the pathogen within an extraordinarily limited time and released its genome sequence as soon as possible; China has been updating the World Health Organization and the international community on its COVID-19 status since Jan. 3; China has so far published seven editions of a diagnosis and treatment plan and six editions of a prevention and control plan for COVID-19, all multilingual.\nChina’s prompt information-sharing is a manifestation of its commitment to unity and cooperation, which enabled the international community to gain a head-start in detecting, preventing and combating COVID-19.\nViruses do not respect borders, nor do epidemics discriminate between races. As United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres has acknowledged, we are facing a global health crisis unlike any in the 75-year history of the UN – one that is spreading human suffering, infecting the global economy and upending people’s lives.\nIndeed, in today’s deeply connected world, no country can stand apart from such a virus that is spreading at an unprecedented speed and scope. From virus source tracing to building a collective global response for disease control and treatment, from identifying the best treatment to producing more medical supplies and seeking breakthroughs in vaccine development, no single country alone can do it all.\nBracing for the impact of the pandemic on the global economy, all countries are on the same boat. Countries need to leverage and coordinate their macro policies to counteract the negative impact, better coordinate financial regulation, keep the global industrial and supply chains stable and thus send a strong signal and restore confidence for global economic recovery. The key to dispersing the shadows of the pandemic hinges on whether the international community can work in unity and render mutual assistance.\nHumanity is a community with a shared future, as Chinese President Xi Jinping said, only by cooperating and responding together can the international community overcome the pandemic. China is committed by both words and deeds. When China fought an uphill battle at home, it has been supporting the global combat against COVID-19 to the best of its ability.\nAs of April 12, 83 video conferences had been held for medical experts between China and 153 other countries, including Indonesia; 14 Chinese medical teams were sent to 12 countries including Cambodia, the Philippines, Myanmar and Laos so that combat experience against the virus can be shared and put in use; China has provided more than 150 countries and international organizations with much needed medical supplies, and has been facilitating the procurement of medical supplies through commercial channels by all countries in China.\nFrom March 1 to April 10 alone, China exported 7.12 billion face masks, 55.57 million pieces of protective clothing, 3.59 million infrared thermometers, 20,100 ventilators, and 13.69 million protective goggles. China is contributing to a sustained global combat against COVID-19.\nAt the end of the day, we may ask: Where does the virus come from? It is a question that should be answered by the science community, utilizing scientific knowledge and methods. More importantly, the purpose of answering that question is to better control the pandemic and save lives, not to facilitate political maneuvers.\nIn the face of this global crisis, some western politicians are stigmatizing others, even passing the buck to others for selfish gains. Such actions would not help with their domestic situation, but undermine global cooperation in combating COVID-19, thus eventually harming all countries.\nUnder the shadows of the COVID-19 pandemic, no single country can stand alone unaffected. Unity and cooperation is the best way for the human race to prevail.\n***\nChinese ambassador to Indonesia\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nRelated Articles\nPandemic treaty talks round wrapping up without a breakthrough\nWhat Trump’s win means for Indonesia’s global health strategy\nWhy corruption could derail Indonesia’s climate fight\nDharma Pongrekun unrepentant over unfounded claims\nThe education policy that could make a difference\nRelated Article\nPandemic treaty talks round wrapping up without a breakthrough\nWhat Trump’s win means for Indonesia’s global health strategy\nWhy corruption could derail Indonesia’s climate fight\nDharma Pongrekun unrepentant over unfounded claims\nThe education policy that could make a difference\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nMore in Academia\nView more\nAcademia\nThe bottom-up wave of democratic rejuvenation\nAcademia\nPolice brutality: Fundamental problems in the institution\nAcademia\nFree trade deals increase Indonesian imports more than exports\nHighlight\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEditorial\nNarrow margin\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nThe Latest\nView more\nEconomy\nRI identifies 29 potential nuclear power plant sites\nEconomy\nChinese authorities are considering a weaker yuan as Trump trade risks loom, sources say\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia commences evacuation of 37 citizens in Damascus\nTech\nUS finalizes $6.1 billion Micron chip-making subsidy\nArchipelago\nTwo foreign visitors killed in tree collapse in Monkey Forest\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEconomy\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources\nRegulations\nBullion bank to launch in first half of next year, Airlangga says"

(The Jakarta Post/Umair Rizaludin )\nS\ntate-owned railway operator PT Kereta Api Indonesia (KAI) will build a new train line to connect Kebon Kawung Station in the city of Bandung, West Java, to Tegalluar Station in Bandung regency, which will be the final station of the Jakarta-Bandung high-speed railway that is currently under development.\n\"We've prepared diesel trains to connect [Bandung’s ] Kebon Kawung Station to Tegalluar Station, which are 16.2 kilometers apart,\" KAI president director Edi Sukmoro said on Monday as reported by&nbsp;\nKompas.com\n.\nEdi said the journey between Tegalluar and Kebon Kawung stations would take only 27 minutes. \"We've prepared five trains, each with a capacity of 300 passengers. We can raise the capacity if the number of passengers increases,\" he said.\nKAI needs to construct 4.2 km of new tracks, half of which will be elevated, to connect Tegalluar and Kebon Kawung stations, Edi said.\nThe new tracks will be built on land already owned by KAI so land acquisition will not be necessary, he added.\nThe funding for the project will come from the Jakarta-Bandung high-speed railway consortium.\n\"We will invest around Rp 4 trillion [US$285.3 million] for the new tracks because around 2 km&nbsp;will be elevated,” Edi said.&nbsp;\n“The consortium will take care of the project. However, we invite the local administration to take part,” he said, adding that the involvement of local stakeholders would prove beneficial to the project.&nbsp;\nHe said the company also envisioned the new line being connected to the Al Jabbar floating mosque in Bandung, which will open to the public in 2020.\nTo make the vision come to life, KAI plans to move Cimekar Station 1 km west of its current location to be behind the mosque.\nThe planned Tegalluar-Bandung line and the Jakarta-Bandung high-speed railway are expected to be completed in 2021.

(Antara/Rosa Panggabean)\nC\nhina is ready to bring greater closeness to the China-ASEAN Community of Shared Destiny to make it an example within the Asian Community of Shared Destiny, President Xi Jinping said on Tuesday.\nXi made the pledge when sending congratulations on the 50th anniversary of ASEAN’s founding in a message to Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, whose country has ASEAN’s rotating chairmanship this year.\nAs a sign of the booming ties between China and the 10-country group, China has been ASEAN’s largest trade partner for eight years.\nTheir trade amounted to US$452.2 billion last year, and currently about 2,700 flights connect China and the 10 countries in every week.\nXi said that since their dialogue partnership was built in 1991, China and ASEAN have stayed true to cooperation and development, their political mutual trust has deepened and their pragmatic cooperation has seen fruitful outcomes.&nbsp;\n“China-ASEAN ties have become one of the most vigorous and enriched dialogue partnerships of ASEAN,” Xi added.\nHe noted that ASEAN has played an important role in securing regional peace and stability since its founding half a century ago, and it has become a force that represents the world’s developing multipolar nature.&nbsp;\nChina expects greater development of the ASEAN community, which will contribute more to regional peace, stability and prosperity and better benefit the people of its member countries, Xi said.\nAs next year marks the 15th anniversary of China and ASEAN establishing their strategic partnership, Xi said China would like to take the year as an opportunity to appreciate all that has been accomplished and look at what can be done over the long run.\nIn Manila on Tuesday, Foreign Minister Wang Yi attended the grand celebration of ASEAN’s 50th anniversary along with his counterparts from ASEAN and other nations.\nDuterte said, “We seek to engage with our neighbors positively in dialogue partnerships that continue to grow.”\nPhilippine Foreign Secretary Alan Peter Cayetano told reporters on Tuesday that “China plays a very positive role” in the region.\n“China has shown economic strength ... in the last decades, its economy has also fueled our growth in ASEAN with tourism from China, manufacturing and infrastructure projects,” he said.\nIn regard to the South China Sea situation, Cayetano said, “All the positive sides China has given to the relationship with ASEAN will not be disturbed” because of disputes there.\n“We will not allow this to disturb our good relationships,” he said.\nWang said on Monday night that with the joint efforts of China and ASEAN countries, the situation in the South China Sea has been stabilized, and pragmatic cooperation has unfolded.\nThis article appeared on the China Daily newspaper website, which is a member of Asia News Network and a media partner of The Jakarta Post\n&nbsp;\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nRelated Articles\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nFree trade deals increase Indonesian imports more than exports\nIndonesia’s tourist sector: A new era of innovation and growth\nPresident Prabowo should make Indonesia a global champion of democracy\nNew mosque in Nusantara to replace Istiqlal as state mosque\nRelated Article\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nFree trade deals increase Indonesian imports more than exports\nIndonesia’s tourist sector: A new era of innovation and growth\nPresident Prabowo should make Indonesia a global champion of democracy\nNew mosque in Nusantara to replace Istiqlal as state mosque\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nHighlight\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEditorial\nNarrow margin\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nThe Latest\nView more\nEconomy\nRI identifies 29 potential nuclear power plant sites\nEconomy\nChinese authorities are considering a weaker yuan as Trump trade risks loom, sources say\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia commences evacuation of 37 citizens in Damascus\nTech\nUS finalizes $6.1 billion Micron chip-making subsidy\nArchipelago\nTwo foreign visitors killed in tree collapse in Monkey Forest\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEconomy\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources\nRegulations\nBullion bank to launch in first half of next year, Airlangga says"

(Reuters/China Daily)\nNo one should underestimate the importance of president-elect\nPrabowo Subianto\n's visit to China and Japan this week.\nHis meetings with Chinese President Xi Jinping and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida demonstrate his intent to maintain an economic-heavy foreign policy but also to infuse global security and defense perspectives amid the growing tension between China and the United States.\nLike many other countries, including even some in the developed world, Indonesia cannot avoid a heavy dependence on China for trade, investment and government-to-government economic cooperation. Prabowo knows this and he has chosen to piggyback on Jokowi and Xi's personal relationship.\nPrabowo achieved a major diplomatic coup by securing a bilateral meeting with&nbsp;Xi, the supreme leader of the world's second-largest economy and Indonesia’s most important economic partner.&nbsp;&nbsp;\nThe meeting with Kishida should also be seen as&nbsp;a victory for Prabowo, considering Japan's position as the fourth-largest economy and as a country that has invested in Indonesia for decades.&nbsp;\nThe feeling was mutual. Xi is certainly enthusiastic about Prabowo because he can expect a continuation of President Jokowi's policies.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nOne major subject that came up during the meeting was the Whoosh high-speed railway (HSR) from Jakarta to Bandung which Xi saw as an&nbsp;example&nbsp;of \"high-quality bilateral cooperation\" and that the project marked \"a new stage of building a community with a shared future.\"\nXi also told Prabowo, a former military general who was once considered a Washington protege,&nbsp;that \"the key to successful China-Indonesia relations is to adhere to strategic independence, mutual trust and mutual assistance, win-win cooperation and fairness and justice.\"\nAfter meeting Xi on Monday, in his capacity as defense minister, Prabowo held talks with several Chinese senior officials including his Chinese counterpart Dong Jun and&nbsp;Prime Minister Li Qiang.\nIn these meetings, Prabowo again reiterated his&nbsp;support for&nbsp;a closer relationship with China and pledged to continue Indonesia's friendly policies toward China\n.\nThe ties between Indonesia and China are not without problems.\nThere is a growing concern over the imbalanced economic ties between the two countries. But before blaming Beijing, the Indonesian government should make an honest assessment of its shortcomings on closing the gap. Too often we complain about unfair treatment from other countries without trying to fix our internal problems.\nAnd then, of course the issue of the&nbsp;Natuna islands, where China claims its fishermen have navigated for centuries. The United Nations has recognized Indonesia's exclusive economic zone (EEZ) rights on the resources-rich body of water, but&nbsp;the two countries must ensure the difference will not&nbsp;adversely impact their bilateral relationship.\nFrom the Beijing visit, we can also see that as the de-facto leader of ASEAN, Prabowo wants to maintain Indonesia's regional leadership while maximizing its position as a middle power in the Indo-Pacific. Indonesia is too important on the world stage to simply stick to one regional bloc.\nPrabowo is cognizant that US President Joe Biden has paid a special attention to him. We can see this from how he congratulated Prabowo soon after&nbsp;the General Elections Commission (KPU) announced the final tally last month.\nWe can also expect that Prabowo will go to Washington, DC before October to reaffirm Indonesia's free and active foreign policy and send a clear message that Indonesia and the region still needs a US presence.\nHis meeting with Kishida, a staunch ally of Biden in the region,&nbsp;and his Japanese counterpart Minoru Kihara should be seen as a precursor to that balancing act.\nThis is also a diplomatic coup for Prabowo, simply because of&nbsp;Japan's position as the world's fourth largest economy and one of Indonesia's most important trade and investment&nbsp;partners.&nbsp;\nThe Japanese government has welcomed Prabowo warmly. \"Indonesia is a comprehensive strategic partner [of Japan] that shares fundamental principles and values, “chief cabinet secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi said on Monday.\nPrabowo's two-country trip this week is a very positive step in laying the groundwork for the larger diplomatic arena that he will navigate once he takes office in October.\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nRelated Articles\nPrabowo calls for more prudent government spending amid global tensions\nReengineering culture to sustain Prabowo’s leadership\nGovt’s pitch to foreign housing developers no easy sell\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nPLN Nusantara Power Showcases Solar PV projects at Japan RE Invest 2024\nRelated Article\nPrabowo calls for more prudent government spending amid global tensions\nReengineering culture to sustain Prabowo’s leadership\nGovt’s pitch to foreign housing developers no easy sell\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nPLN Nusantara Power Showcases Solar PV projects at Japan RE Invest 2024\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nMore in Opinion\nView more\nAcademia\nThe bottom-up wave of democratic rejuvenation\nAcademia\nPolice brutality: Fundamental problems in the institution\nAcademia\nFree trade deals increase Indonesian imports more than exports\nHighlight\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEditorial\nNarrow margin\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nThe Latest\nView more\nEconomy\nRI identifies 29 potential nuclear power plant sites\nEconomy\nChinese authorities are considering a weaker yuan as Trump trade risks loom, sources say\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia commences evacuation of 37 citizens in Damascus\nTech\nUS finalizes $6.1 billion Micron chip-making subsidy\nArchipelago\nTwo foreign visitors killed in tree collapse in Monkey Forest\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEconomy\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources\nRegulations\nBullion bank to launch in first half of next year, Airlangga says"

(AFP/Ludovic Marin)\nW\ne are currently celebrating the 61st anniversary of the Elysée Treaty, signed on Jan. 22, 1963, by then French president Charles de Gaulle and German chancellor Konrad Adenauer, to seal the reconciliation between France and Germany. The two countries were long considered sworn enemies and&nbsp;had clashed in three major wars in 1870, in World War I from 1914 to 1918, and then in World War II from 1939 to 1945.\nThe Elysée Treaty instituted regular consultations between Germany and France on key issues such as defense, education and youth, which have helped nurture the development of structuring cooperation between the two countries and fostered&nbsp;the process of building the European Union.\nAt a time when the French and German populations were still severely scarred by the consequences of war, this reconciliation was made possible by the strong political will expressed by the German and French leaders of the time to lay the foundations for a lasting peace between the two states, guaranteeing their prosperity and the well-being of their citizens.\nThis ambition was first and foremost for the benefit of young people in both countries, to ensure that they were spared the suffering endured by their elders and offered the perspective of a shared future.\nThe Franco-German Office for Youth, created in 1963, has played a major role in the development of exchanges between our two countries. Since then, over 9&nbsp;million young people from France and Germany have taken part in exchange programs.\nMore recently, historians from both countries contributed to the publication of a joint history book in 2006, helping to develop a truly shared vision of the history of our two nations among schoolchildren in both countries.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nThese groundbreaking initiatives, launched in the 1960s, have brought successive generations of young Germans and French closer together over the long term and helped change the way each population views the other. In this way, a solid and fruitful friendship between our two peoples has gradually taken root, to the benefit of strengthening bilateral relations and the construction of Europe.\nToday, this ambition is intact and continues to strive through the joint efforts of Germany and France for a sovereign Europe, ever more united, supportive, and strong in the face of the challenges of an unstable contemporary world fraught with tensions.\nThis is reflected in the provisions of the Franco-German Aachen Treaty of Jan. 22, 2019, which was adopted to complement and strengthen the Elysée Treaty, particularly in the fields of economic, energy and environmental policy, and to foster ever-closer ties between our two peoples. Around the same time and guided by a similar ambition, our national parliaments established a Parliamentary Assembly common to both countries.\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, this strengthened Franco-German cooperation made it possible to build a joint health and economic response to ensure that Europe emerges stronger from the pandemic.\nFrom the outset of Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine, with the aid given to Kyiv and the sanctions imposed on Russia due to its flagrant violation of international law, first and foremost the principles of respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of states, France and Germany have also demonstrated their unwavering support for Ukraine, whose destiny is linked to that of Europe as a whole.&nbsp;\nWith regard to the situation in the Middle East, the German and French foreign ministers reiterated, during their exchange in Berlin on Jan. 14, the mobilization of Germany and France to support peace efforts. To provide immediate assistance to the population of Gaza, the European Union provided&nbsp;over 100 million euros (US$108.64 million) in humanitarian aid in 2023, alongside substantial contributions by many European countries, including France and Germany.\nFaithful to the original promise of the Elysée Treaty, France and Germany intend to embody as much as possible a community of destiny in Europe, based on dialogue, cooperation and solidarity.\nAlongside their allies and foreign partners, they also remain determined to promote and defend an international order based on the principles of the United Nations Charter, to the benefit of the prosperity and well-being of all the peoples of the world.\n***\nFabien Penone is French ambassador to Indonesia, ASEAN and Timor-Leste.

The government claimed it would also cut the Jakarta to Surabaya, East Java, trip to just four hours from currently more than ten hours.\nLuhut Binsar Pandjaitan, Coordinating Minister of Investment and Maritime Affairs, said on Friday that the Jakarta-Bandung high speed railway remains a good project despite years of delays since its initial completion target in 2019, while extending it to Surabaya could benefit the country more.\n“If the government continue this to Surabaya, I think it will make [transportation cost in] Indonesia more efficient,” Luhut told reporters after an event with China Chamber of Commerce in Indonesia.\nRead also:\nChina or Japan: Govt mulls over Jakarta-Surabaya railway plans\nProspects\nEvery Monday\nWith exclusive interviews and in-depth coverage of the region's most pressing business issues, \"Prospects\" is the go-to source for staying ahead of the curve in Indonesia's rapidly evolving business landscape.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nAsked whether the government would choose between China or Japan to execute the extension, Luhut said that he preferred the former.\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nRelated Articles\nPutin’s India visit aims to shape global multipolarity\nVietnam to build $67 billion high-speed railway\nChina-Laos Railway handles more than 10 million tons of goods since opening\nKAI asks for government help to alleviate high-speed rail debt burden\nWhoosh prices to fluctuate with customer demand\nRelated Article\nPutin’s India visit aims to shape global multipolarity\nVietnam to build $67 billion high-speed railway\nChina-Laos Railway handles more than 10 million tons of goods since opening\nKAI asks for government help to alleviate high-speed rail debt burden\nWhoosh prices to fluctuate with customer demand\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nMore in Business\nView more\nEconomy\nRI identifies 29 potential nuclear power plant sites\nEconomy\nChinese authorities are considering a weaker yuan as Trump trade risks loom, sources say\nTech\nUS finalizes $6.1 billion Micron chip-making subsidy\nHighlight\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEditorial\nNarrow margin\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nThe Latest\nView more\nEconomy\nRI identifies 29 potential nuclear power plant sites\nEconomy\nChinese authorities are considering a weaker yuan as Trump trade risks loom, sources say\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia commences evacuation of 37 citizens in Damascus\nTech\nUS finalizes $6.1 billion Micron chip-making subsidy\nArchipelago\nTwo foreign visitors killed in tree collapse in Monkey Forest\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEconomy\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources\nRegulations\nBullion bank to launch in first half of next year, Airlangga says"

(JP/Arya Dipa)\nW\nest Java Governor Ridwal Kamil will summon representatives from PT Kereta Cepat Indonesia China (KCIC) and other related parties in charge of the Jakarta-Bandung high-speed railway project following a construction mishap that led to a fatal explosion from an underground oil pipe belonging to state-owned energy company Pertamina near a toll road in Bandung, West Java, last week.\nThe governor will also discuss other cases of environmental risks and hazards in several regions that were allegedly caused by the high-speed railway project, including noticeable cracks within the walls of a local residence near the construction site in Laksana Mekar village, Padalarang district, West Bandung.\n“I demand professionalism and strict adherence to the standard operating procedures. I’m aware it’s a highly anticipated project, but please complete it in an orderly and safe fashion so as to not disrupt the lives of local residents,” Ridwan said.\n“I’ve recapitulated the number of reported cases and summoned several regional heads to discuss their problems [related to the high-speed railway construction]. Among the affected regions are Cimahi, Bandung, West Bandung and Purwakarta regency.”\nThe high-speed railway project is one of the government's national strategic projects in the transportation sector, constructed with Chinese assistance and a total investment of US$6.07 billion. The railway will travel at 350 kilometers per hour, cutting travel time between Jakarta and Bandung in West Java to 45 minutes, faster than the three and half hours on a normal train.\nLand procurement for the project has neared 100 percent completion, with an overall development progress of 30 percent.\n“We move forward with the project. Accidents happen from time to time, but I’m making sure they don’t occur [frequently],” Ridwan said, adding that he expected the high-speed train to commence operations by the first semester of 2021.\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nRelated Articles\nAt least five dead, seven missing after West Java floods, landslides\nRidwan Kamil vows to transform Thousand Islands into global tourist hub\nJakarta’s lesson learned: Advancing metro cities\nRI officials no idea about Bruneian firm's HSR proposal in Kalimantan\nYoung people fight back against ecoanxiety\nRelated Article\nAt least five dead, seven missing after West Java floods, landslides\nRidwan Kamil vows to transform Thousand Islands into global tourist hub\nJakarta’s lesson learned: Advancing metro cities\nRI officials no idea about Bruneian firm's HSR proposal in Kalimantan\nYoung people fight back against ecoanxiety\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nMore in News\nView more\nOpinion\nAnalysis: Govt adopts mandatory B35 biodiesel program as CPO prices tumble\nBusiness\nGlobal chip crunch stunts Indonesia car sales recovery\nBusiness\nXL profit falls in Q3 as tower sale income dries\nHighlight\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEditorial\nNarrow margin\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nThe Latest\nView more\nEconomy\nRI identifies 29 potential nuclear power plant sites\nEconomy\nChinese authorities are considering a weaker yuan as Trump trade risks loom, sources say\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia commences evacuation of 37 citizens in Damascus\nTech\nUS finalizes $6.1 billion Micron chip-making subsidy\nArchipelago\nTwo foreign visitors killed in tree collapse in Monkey Forest\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEconomy\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources\nRegulations\nBullion bank to launch in first half of next year, Airlangga says"

The BPOM has the preeminent job in controlling it, but the reality is drugs aren't controlled well. The BPOM must engage in cooperation with other agencies like the police and organizations like the Indonesian Pharmacy Organization because Indonesia is too large to be handled only by the BPOM.\nJacko Atmaja\nWe should appreciate what the BPOM has done. They should continue such operations in order to clear the market from these illegal products, especially traditional medicines, the fact is the BPOM found a lot of jamu (traditional medicines) that contain chemicals.\nIt's a good step for the BPOM to confiscate all the illegal products. Moreover, we hope that the government will also take action to stop the factories that produce illegal medicines.\nRicha Christi\nThe government should act harder against illegal factories, Consumers are in danger from illegal cosmetics and medicines.\nRiski Widi\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nRelated Articles\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nFree trade deals increase Indonesian imports more than exports\nIndonesia’s tourist sector: A new era of innovation and growth\nPresident Prabowo should make Indonesia a global champion of democracy\nNew mosque in Nusantara to replace Istiqlal as state mosque\nRelated Article\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nFree trade deals increase Indonesian imports more than exports\nIndonesia’s tourist sector: A new era of innovation and growth\nPresident Prabowo should make Indonesia a global champion of democracy\nNew mosque in Nusantara to replace Istiqlal as state mosque\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nMore in News\nView more\nOpinion\nAnalysis: Govt adopts mandatory B35 biodiesel program as CPO prices tumble\nBusiness\nGlobal chip crunch stunts Indonesia car sales recovery\nBusiness\nXL profit falls in Q3 as tower sale income dries\nHighlight\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEditorial\nNarrow margin\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nThe Latest\nView more\nEconomy\nRI identifies 29 potential nuclear power plant sites\nEconomy\nChinese authorities are considering a weaker yuan as Trump trade risks loom, sources say\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia commences evacuation of 37 citizens in Damascus\nTech\nUS finalizes $6.1 billion Micron chip-making subsidy\nArchipelago\nTwo foreign visitors killed in tree collapse in Monkey Forest\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEconomy\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources\nRegulations\nBullion bank to launch in first half of next year, Airlangga says"

(AFP/Nhac Nguyen)\nT\nhe period from August to September marks a significant period for both Indonesia and Vietnam historically. After Sukarno proclaimed Indonesian independence on Aug. 17, 1945, Ho Chi Minh declared the independence of Vietnam on Sept. 2 of the same year.\nLooking back at the past decade, Indonesia and Vietnam have enjoyed strong economic cooperation. Driven by our strong partnership and rapid economic development, bilateral trade and investment have grown exponentially. In 2023, bilateral trade reached US$13.8 billion in 2023, exceeding the target of $10 billion set by the leaders of both countries. Two-way investment between the countries also reached unprecedented figures.\nThis year marks a milestone for Indonesia-Vietnam bilateral relations, with President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo making a state visit to Hanoi in January. The key takeaway of the visit was the commitment to promote cooperation and collaboration to achieve the shared vision of becoming high-income countries by 2045.\nAs a follow-up to this visit, ministers of the two ASEAN countries have met to discuss the ways forward. This includes setting a new bilateral trade target of $18 billion by 2028 - reflecting our success in achieving the previous target.\nThe fulfillment of this new target lies in promoting cooperation on five key sectors that we consider the priority of Indonesia-Vietnam economic cooperation, namely agriculture, fisheries, renewable energy, the digital economy and high-tech industries.\nWith a combined population of more than 380 million, food security serves as a key foundation of economic development for both Indonesia and Vietnam.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nAs developing countries, agriculture and fisheries play important roles in ensuring national food security. In this sense, cooperation between the two countries should be focused on supporting each other and exploring ways to increase productivity. Moreover, being among the largest rice and fish producers in the world, cooperation between Indonesia and Vietnam is essential to not only ensure domestic sufficiency, but also regional food security.\nAmid rapid economic growth, however, Indonesia and Vietnam must be able to address the issues of sustainability.\nAs industrialization tends to jeopardize air quality and environmental sustainability, Indonesia has set a net-zero emissions target by 2060 and Vietnam by 2050. Both countries are currently exploring ways to reach this target, to accelerate the transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy.\nWhile commitments to reach these targets exist, their implementation remains a challenge. To this end, both countries need to double down on efforts in the energy transition, including exchanging best practices and sharing experiences, particularly on the implementation of the Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP) framework, in which Indonesia and Vietnam are partners.\nFurthermore, today the availability of renewable energy and efforts toward energy transition also become key elements in attracting quality investment, as investors now consider environmental, social, governance (ESG) issues a deciding factor for investment.\nGiven the strong demography of the working age population, cooperation in the digital economy is also a huge potential for both countries. Start-ups in both countries are rising at a rapid pace, and this positive momentum should be harnessed effectively.\nWith a more integrated digital economy, Indonesia and Vietnam can promote cross-border payments and transactions, which will speed up economic activities between both countries.\nTo fulfill the aspirations to become developed economies, it is important for both countries to focus on producing high value-added products, based on technology. Both Indonesia and Vietnam are developing their own expertise.\nFor instance, Vietnam’s electric vehicles, which are already entering Indonesia’s market, or Indonesia’s animal pharmaceutical businesses, one of which has just completed building the largest animal vaccine factory in Vietnam this year. The two countries should complement each other and together contribute to building a regional single production base in Southeast Asia.\nBeyond 2024, amid the challenges, the prospect for Indonesia-Vietnam economic relations will continue to shine bright. New leaderships following the inauguration of Vietnam’s President To Lam in May 2024, followed by the inauguration of Indonesia’s new president in October 2024, are expected to invigorate cooperation between both countries.\nIndonesia’s president-elect\nPrabowo Subianto\nis expected to continue the success of existing programs while adding extra focus on other sectors, such as promoting the development of human resources from early years. These extra sectors will create new avenues for Indonesia and Vietnam cooperation.\nBy riding the positive wave of the demographic bonus, the shared vision to become high-income countries, and the passion of the people, I am positive of the future of Indonesia and Vietnam.\nNext year, Indonesia and Vietnam will celebrate an important milestone in our long-forged relationship, 70 years of diplomatic relations. This is a great opportunity for both countries to strengthen the partnership into higher levels.\nWhile in the region, the increasing influence of Indonesia and Vietnam will be one of the key foundations for ASEAN to maintain its stability, centrality and unity. Hence promoting stability and security must continue to be at the top of the list for both countries, both in the bilateral context and in the context of ASEAN.\nIn this sense I am confident that both Indonesia and Vietnam will continue to be fully committed to contributing to peace, stability and prosperity in the ASEAN region and beyond.\n***\nThe writer is Indonesian ambassador to Vietnam\n.\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nRelated Articles\nMake farming profitable again\nActivists protest rejection of dog and cat meat trade ban\nMeaningful digital transformation for the Asia-Pacific region\nState budget financing remains on track to protect welfare, maintain stability\nA Trump return would threaten global fight against climate change\nRelated Article\nMake farming profitable again\nActivists protest rejection of dog and cat meat trade ban\nMeaningful digital transformation for the Asia-Pacific region\nState budget financing remains on track to protect welfare, maintain stability\nA Trump return would threaten global fight against climate change\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nMore in Opinion\nView more\nAcademia\nThe bottom-up wave of democratic rejuvenation\nAcademia\nPolice brutality: Fundamental problems in the institution\nAcademia\nFree trade deals increase Indonesian imports more than exports\nHighlight\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEditorial\nNarrow margin\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nThe Latest\nView more\nEconomy\nRI identifies 29 potential nuclear power plant sites\nEconomy\nChinese authorities are considering a weaker yuan as Trump trade risks loom, sources say\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia commences evacuation of 37 citizens in Damascus\nTech\nUS finalizes $6.1 billion Micron chip-making subsidy\nArchipelago\nTwo foreign visitors killed in tree collapse in Monkey Forest\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEconomy\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources\nRegulations\nBullion bank to launch in first half of next year, Airlangga says"

(Reuters/China Daily)\nVersi Bahasa Indonesia\nP\nresident-elect\nPrabowo Subianto\nvisited Beijing on Monday on his first foreign trip since his election, and was quoted by Chinese state media as telling President Xi Jinping he aimed to continue the close ties under predecessor Joko \"Jokowi\" Widodo.\nPrabowo \"fully supports the development of closer&nbsp;Indonesia-China relations and wishes to continue President Joko's policy of friendship with China,\" China's CCTV quoted Prabowo as saying.\nThe new&nbsp;Indonesian government will promote the alignment of development strategies between the two countries and push for more results in cooperation in fields such as the economy, trade and poverty alleviation, he said.\nPrabowo, now a defence minister, also said that he viewed China as a key partner.\n\"Regarding defence cooperation, I view China as one of the key partners in ensuring regional peace and stability,\" he said in a statement, adding that he sought to boost defence cooperations with China.\n\"I also commit to fulfil the needs of&nbsp;Indonesia's military hardware, boost cooperation in the defence industry and establish productive dialogues,\" he added.&nbsp;\nXi described Prabowo as an \"old friend of the Chinese people\" and said China views its relations with&nbsp;Indonesia&nbsp;from a strategic and long-term perspective, standing ready to deepen all-round strategic cooperation.\nXi also told Prabowo that bilateral ties \"have entered a new stage of jointly building a community with a shared future\", state broadcaster CCTV reported.\nChina \"is willing to deepen all-round strategic cooperation with Indonesia and build a China-Indonesia community with... regional and global influence, so as to bring more benefits to the two peoples and make positive contributions to regional and world peace and development,\" Xi said.\nPrabowo, 72, was elected in February but will not be sworn in until October. A long-time rival of the outgoing leader Jokowi, he is now widely seen as enjoying his predecessor's strong support, winning his decisive victory with Jokowi's son as his vice presidential running-mate.\n\"The key to the valuable achievements of China-Indonesia&nbsp;relations lies in adherence to strategic autonomy, mutual trust and mutual assistance,\" CCTV quoted Xi as saying in the meeting.\nPrabowo's decision to visit China ahead of&nbsp;Indonesia's neighbours in the region underlines the close partnership built up in the past decade under Jokowi, when China became&nbsp;Indonesia's top trading partner, supplying natural resources including nickel and coal.&nbsp;\nJokowi's first visit after his inauguration was to China, for an annual summit of Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) leaders in 2014. That was followed by six more visits.\nChina has also ploughed billions into&nbsp;Indonesian infrastructure and industrial projects, including the Jakarta-Bandung high-speed railway.&nbsp;\nXi hailed the rail initiative as \"a golden sign of high-quality cooperation between the two countries\", according to CCTV.\nIt remains to be seen how Prabowo, now&nbsp;Indonesia's defence minister, will navigate issues including the jostling for influence between China and the United States in Southeast Asia.&nbsp;\nPrabowo has previously said&nbsp;Indonesia&nbsp;was committed to its policy of non-alignment and would keep good ties with both China and the United States.&nbsp;\nChina's expansive claims in the South China Sea may present a test for his leadership, although the two countries' overlapping claims there have not become a vociferous dispute as has unfolded in recent months between China and the Philippines.&nbsp;\nIndonesia&nbsp;says the southern end of the South China Sea is part of its exclusive economic zone. China says the area is within its own territorial claim, marked by a U-shaped \"nine-dash line\" rejected by other regional states.\nChina is willing to continue to deepen maritime cooperation with&nbsp;Indonesia, Xi told Prabowo on Monday.\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nRelated Articles\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nReengineering culture to sustain Prabowo’s leadership\nFocus on revenue reform\nPutin’s India visit aims to shape global multipolarity\nVietnam to build $67 billion high-speed railway\nRelated Article\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nReengineering culture to sustain Prabowo’s leadership\nFocus on revenue reform\nPutin’s India visit aims to shape global multipolarity\nVietnam to build $67 billion high-speed railway\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nMore in World\nView more\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia commences evacuation of 37 citizens in Damascus\nMiddle East and Africa\nAirline pilots, crews voice concerns about Middle East routes\nAmericas\nLula 'stable' after emergency surgery\nHighlight\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEditorial\nNarrow margin\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nThe Latest\nView more\nEconomy\nRI identifies 29 potential nuclear power plant sites\nEconomy\nChinese authorities are considering a weaker yuan as Trump trade risks loom, sources say\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia commences evacuation of 37 citizens in Damascus\nTech\nUS finalizes $6.1 billion Micron chip-making subsidy\nArchipelago\nTwo foreign visitors killed in tree collapse in Monkey Forest\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEconomy\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources\nRegulations\nBullion bank to launch in first half of next year, Airlangga says"

We expect testing [to begin] by the end of 2022 and operations by [the end of] June 2023,” Jokowi said during his visit to the site.\nRead also:\nGovt to pour Rp 4.3T into Jakarta-Bandung railway project\nThe delay also adds to the cost overrun on the project, which will weigh on the state budget, since Presidential Regulation No. 93/2021 issued last year allows the government to finance the project or provide guarantees for more loans.\nIn September last year, the State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) Ministry estimated that the project had overrun its budget by Rp 27.17 trillion (US$1.9 billion) to Rp 113.9 trillion as a result of land-acquisition problems, overoptimistic planning and poor project management.\nJokowi expressed the hope that, once finished, the railway will ease traffic and increase mobility for people and freight in the area.\nPT Kereta Cepat Indonesia China (KCIC), the consortium running the project, said on Monday it had anticipated the delay as an unforeseen event that had also been included in the cost overrun calculation.\n“We have included it. So, we hope there will be no more change to the cost overrun,” KCIC president director Dwiyana Slamet Riyadi said, as quoted by\nTempo\n, adding that it would not affect the proposed fare previously estimated at around Rp 250,000 to Rp 350,000.\nRead also:\nJakarta-Bandung high-speed train gets bigger govt backing after cost overrun\nThe consortium added that it had been working on options to finance the cost overrun but had yet to decide as the process involved the government in negotiation.\nThe government has asked the management to cut costs as best as it can so that the cost overrun can be kept to a minimum.\n“It's like\nPak\nLuhut [Coordinating Maritime Affairs and Investment Minister Luhut Pandjaitan] said: The dry towels can be squeezed again.

(Reuters/Jason Lee)\nA\nug. 1, 2022 marked the 95\nth\nanniversary of the founding of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) of China. In 1927, the Communist Party of China created a new type of people’s army, which provided a strong guarantee for the realization of independence and great rejuvenation of China.\nFrom that time on, the PLA has bravely devoted itself to the historical trend of seeking liberation and happiness for the Chinese people, and striving for independence and rejuvenation for China. Over the past 95 years, the PLA has gone through wars and fires, opened up a way through brambles and thorns and made great sacrifices, chalked up one victory after another and established historical feats.\nIn recent years, the PLA of China has upheld “Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era”, firmly and thoroughly implemented President Xi’s thinking on strengthening the armed forces, marched forward on the strategic arrangement of “Three Steps to Modernize China’s National Defense and Military”, ensured the realization of the Chinese army’s centennial goal, enhanced the political loyalty of its armed forces, strengthened them via reform and technology and the training of competent personnel and run them in accordance with the law.\nPLA will take substantial steps on a Chinese path to military development, and comprehensively improve the level of modernizing national defense and the armed forces.&nbsp;China’s military has basically achieved mechanization and has made significant progress in information technology. At any time, the PLA of China has the resolve, the confidence and the ability to defend China’s sovereignty, security and development interests; deter and resist aggression; safeguard national-political security, people’s security and social stability; safeguard legitimate rights and interests, and its overseas interests; and support the sustainable development of the country.\nChinese people love and cherish peace, and take it as their sacred duty to maintain world peace and oppose hegemonism and power politics. For a long time, China remains committed to the path of peaceful development, develops itself by striving for a peaceful international environment and maintains and promotes world peace through its own development in return.\nChina has the world’s best record on peace and security issues. At present, China is still the only country in the world that has incorporated “adhering to the path of peaceful development” into its constitution, and is also the only among the five nuclear-weapons states with nuclear weapons that has promised\nno-first-use of nuclear weapons and unconditional or no threat of nuclear weapons on non-nuclear weapons states and non-nuclear weapon zones.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nAt present, the world is undergoing a historical change in an unprecedented way, posing challenges that must be taken seriously by mankind. Facing this critical moment of world peace and development, President Xi proposed the Global Security Initiative, systematically expounding China's position and proposition on promoting world security and maintaining world peace and security, emphasizing the adherence to a common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable-security vision.\nChina will continue to uphold the banner of peace, development, cooperation and win-win results, pursue an independent foreign policy of peace, adhere to the path of peaceful development, promote the building of a new type of international relations and promote the construction of a community with a shared future for mankind.\nThe PLA has actively participated in international military exchanges and cooperation and in United Nations peacekeeping operations. It has worked with the armed forces of other countries to address global-security challenges, actively fulfilled international responsibilities and obligations and made great contributions to promoting the construction of a community with a shared future for mankind.\nChina and Indonesia are good neighbors, friends and partners. In recent years, with the leadership and support of President Xi and President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo, the comprehensive strategic partnership between the two countries has been developing in depth; exchanges and cooperation in various fields are getting closer and have achieved fruitful results, bringing benefits to the two peoples and making contributions to world and regional peace, stability, development and cooperation.\nAt the invitation of Xi, Jokowi paid a successful visit to China in late July, becoming the first foreign head of state that China has received in Beijing since the Beijing Winter Olympics in February of this year, demonstrating the great strategic significance and far-reaching global influence of the relationship between the two countries.\nThe two heads of state agreed to determine the general direction of the China-Indonesia community with a shared future, and committed to forging an exemplary model of major-developing countries seeking mutual benefit, win-win results, common development and South-South cooperation, promoting a series of cooperation outcomes and injecting strong impetus into the development of bilateral relations.\nThe defense and military relationship, as an important part of China-Indonesia relations, has also made new progress. The two armies continuously improve the level of strategic mutual trust. Chinese State Councilor and Minister of National Defense General Wei Fenghe and Indonesian Defense Minister\nPrabowo Subianto\nvisited each other and conducted candid, friendly and fruitful exchanges. Cooperation in military academies and joint exercises have been expanded to multiple fields and levels.\nHumanitarian-relief cooperation has become a highlight of military cooperation between China and Indonesia. Meanwhile, humanitarian-relief cooperation has become the focus and highlight of the relationship between the two armed forces. The leaders of the two militaries extended sympathies and support to each other at difficult times such as the fight against COVID-19 and the tragic sinking of the Indonesian Navy submarine, and took solid and effective measures to help each other.\nAt present, the Chinese government firmly supports Indonesia in hosting the Group of 20 summit later this year and ASEAN meetings next year. All these fully reflect the deep friendship between the two countries and the two armed forces that, as the Indonesian proverb goes,\nBerat sama dipikul, ringan sama&nbsp;dijinjing\n(Share the burden whether heavy or light).\nI am fully confident that with the support and care of their heads of state, the defense departments and armed forces of China and Indonesia will further consolidate and deepen friendly cooperation, add more substance to the China-Indonesia comprehensive strategic partnership and contribute to regional and world peace, stability and development.\n&nbsp;***\nThe writer, a senior colonel, is the defense attaché at the Embassy of the People’s Republic of China&nbsp;in Indonesia.\n&nbsp;\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nRelated Articles\nIs Southeast Asia the next frontier for AI?\nTaiwan's Lai kicks off Marshall Islands visit as China fumes\nGovt to review PIK 2’s spatial planning amid land use concerns\nMass casualty attacks in China put focus on mental health as economy slows\nThe visible and the marginalized: Examining our rule of law\nRelated Article\nIs Southeast Asia the next frontier for AI?\nTaiwan's Lai kicks off Marshall Islands visit as China fumes\nGovt to review PIK 2’s spatial planning amid land use concerns\nMass casualty attacks in China put focus on mental health as economy slows\nThe visible and the marginalized: Examining our rule of law\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nMore in Opinion\nView more\nAcademia\nThe bottom-up wave of democratic rejuvenation\nAcademia\nPolice brutality: Fundamental problems in the institution\nAcademia\nFree trade deals increase Indonesian imports more than exports\nHighlight\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEditorial\nNarrow margin\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nThe Latest\nView more\nEconomy\nRI identifies 29 potential nuclear power plant sites\nEconomy\nChinese authorities are considering a weaker yuan as Trump trade risks loom, sources say\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia commences evacuation of 37 citizens in Damascus\nTech\nUS finalizes $6.1 billion Micron chip-making subsidy\nArchipelago\nTwo foreign visitors killed in tree collapse in Monkey Forest\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEconomy\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources\nRegulations\nBullion bank to launch in first half of next year, Airlangga says"

(AFP)\nAt the invitation of Indonesian President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang will pay an official visit to Indonesia from May 6 to 8. Indonesia will be the first stop of the first overseas trip by the Chinese premier since the new Chinese government was formed in March 2018. It fully demonstrates the great significance China places on its relationship with Indonesia.\nBoth China and Indonesia are ancient civilizations with a splendid history. The history of friendly exchanges between the two peoples can be traced back to the Han dynasty more than 2,000 years ago.\nThe great Chinese navigator Zheng He from the Ming Dynasty made seven voyages to the “Western Seas”, leaving behind countless legacies in Java and Sumatra. Indonesia was one of the first countries to establish diplomatic relations with the new China.\nIn the 1950s, both countries stood together with other countries in Asia and Africa to advocate the Bandung Spirit, featuring peaceful coexistence and seeking common ground while reserving differences. Today, it remains an important guideline for state-to-state relations. Since its inception 68 years ago, the China-Indonesia relationship has seen its fair share of ups and downs and developed by leaps and bounds. The resumption of diplomatic ties in 1990 started a new chapter in the development of bilateral relations. To build even stronger relations has become the shared commitment and resolve of both governments and societies.\nViewing Indonesia as a priority in China’s neighborhood diplomacy, President Xi Jinping and the Chinese government have attached great importance to the development of China-Indonesia relations over the past five years. As of today, President Xi has paid two visits to Indonesia. During his state visit to Indonesia in 2013, President Xi unveiled the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road Initiative, and elevated the bilateral relationship to a comprehensive strategic partnership. In 2015, President Xi once again visited Indonesia to attend the Asian-African Summit and commemoration of the 60th anniversary of the Bandung Conference. The two sides have jointly promoted and enhanced the Asian-African spirit of solidarity and cooperation.\nChina and Indonesia are good neighbors, good friends and good partners. The broad common interests and deep-rooted friendship serve as a tight linkage between the two countries. In recent years, under the leadership of President Xi and President Jokowi, China and Indonesia have focused on promoting synergy between respective development strategies and expanded cooperation across the board. The bilateral relations have embarked on a fast track of development. President Jokowi has paid five visits to China and held six bilateral meetings with President Xi. The two heads of state have reached an important consensus on enhancing their comprehensive strategic partnership. China has remained Indonesia’s largest trading partner for seven consecutive years. In 2017, bilateral trade registered a year-on-year increase of 18.3 percent to exceed US$63.3 billion. Indonesia’s exports to China increased by 33 percent, promoting a balanced development of bilateral trade. Meanwhile, China’s annual investment in Indonesia increased by over 30 percent to reach $3.4 billion. Major cooperation projects, including the Jakarta-Bandung high-speed railway project, are in full swing. In 2017, the number of Chinese tourists to Indonesia surpassed 2 million for the first time, totaling 2.06 million, which made China the largest source of overseas tourists to Indonesia. Having received over 14,000 Indonesian students, China has become Indonesia’s second-largest destination for overseas studies. Chinese giant pandas Cai Tao and Hu Chun made their home in Indonesia, bringing a message of friendship and goodwill from the Chinese people.\nToday, we live in a time in which there is an overwhelming trend toward peace and cooperation, openness and connectivity, and reform and innovation. The 19th CPC National Congress held last October ushered socialism with Chinese characteristics into a new era. It marks a new chapter in China’s rejuvenation and its effort for shared prosperity with the rest of the world. In this new era, China will stay committed to advancing reform in all respects, follow the new development vision, implement the strategy of opening up for win-win results and stick to the path of peaceful development. By doing so, we will be able to build a new type of international relations, and a community with a shared future for mankind.\nThe year 2018 marks the 40th anniversary of China’s reform and opening up. What has happened proves that opening up was key to China’s economic growth over the past 40 years and in the same vein, high-quality development of China’s economy in the future can only be achieved with greater openness. A more open and prosperous China not only benefits its people but also provides new opportunities for countries in the region and beyond, including Indonesia. I believe the opportunities are as follows:\nFirst is market opportunity. Despite the lack of effective global demand, the potential of the Chinese market is still growing. China does not seek a trade surplus; it has a genuine desire to increase imports. It is estimated that China will import $10 trillion in goods in the coming five years. This November, China will host the first China International Import Expo. We cordially invite the Indonesian business community to participate and promote Indonesian products.\nPremier Li Keqiang (right) meets with President Joko Widodo. (XIE Huanchi, Xinhua News Agency)\nSecond is investment opportunity. In this new round of reform, China encourages businesses and individuals to invest abroad. Chinese businesses are becoming a major source of international investment and financing. China’s outbound investment is estimated to reach $750 billion in the next five years. With a continuously improving business environment, Indonesia is becoming a major destination for Chinese investment.\nThird is people-to-people exchange opportunity. The number of Chinese outbound tourists is expected to reach 700 million in the coming five years. Indonesia in recent years has attracted a growing number of tourists from China. Tourist resorts such as Bali, Manado and Yogyakarta have become increasingly popular among Chinese tourists. I believe this growing trend will not only help enhance mutual understanding between the two countries, but also boost the local economy. Moreover, China will provide more varieties of scholarships to help Indonesian students to realize their dream of studying in China.\nFourth is growth opportunity. The world today needs a developing China more than ever. Over the past five years, in the face of sluggish world economic recovery, the Chinese economy has registered an average growth rate of 7.1 percent. Contributing over 30 percent of global growth, China has become a key anchor and driver for the world economy. In this new era, China will stay committed to reform and opening up, promote high-quality development of its economy, and continue to contribute to the economic development of all countries around the world, including Indonesia.\nDuring the official visit, Premier Li will hold bilateral meetings with President Jokowi and other Indonesian leaders to exchange views on further promoting synergy between development strategies and expand practical cooperation. The visit will chart the future direction of China-Indonesia relations in this new era. The leaders will also witness the signing of multiple cooperation agreements in the sectors of strategic alignment, e-commerce and agriculture, injecting new impetus to the bilateral friendly cooperation.\nUnity gives us strength and good solid work will shape our future. This year marks the fifth anniversary of the China-Indonesia Comprehensive Strategic Partnership. I believe the two countries will draw on the momentum generated by the upcoming visit by Premier Li and make concerted efforts to implement the important consensus reached between the leaders, further synergize development strategies, push forward construction of major projects, including the Jakarta-Bandung high-speed railway, kick-start cooperation on the Regional Comprehensive Economic Corridors, and elevate bilateral practical cooperation to new heights.

We are not building villas, we are building a vision,” he says.\nThe company’s approach to integrative Wellness encompasses physical, mental and spiritual health, offering advanced amenities such as ultramodern saunas and OKEARA structured hydrogen water, known for its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, along with a range of other benefits. These form part of the highly personalized programs that enable optimized lifestyles through education and support.\nInvestment in Nature is vital to ELEMENTIS, as demonstrated by its modern architectural designs that maximize ecological immersion and minimize environmental impact without compromising on comfort.\n“We offer abundant opportunities for outdoor recreation and exploration, harmonizing our lifestyles with the natural world,” says Titov.\nELEMENTIS has a profound commitment to Community building as integral to its business ethos. Beyond being a hospitality brand, it strives to unite like-minded individuals who embrace innovation and comprehensive holistic wellness.\n“We aim to cultivate a thriving Community that fosters the ongoing development of Elementis and helps us realize our vision,” Titov says.\nInnovation is the company’s cornerstone, driving its team to enhance the Elementis experience through collaboration with leading experts while fostering creativity and prioritizing a forward-thinking mindset.\n“By utilizing next-generation technology and energy-efficient solutions, the company is leading the way in industry trends and advancements,” says chief hospitality officer Michael Burchett, a veteran hospitality professional with over 45 years in the global industry.\nAmong the company’s founding partners is Singapore-based Sun-Ice Energy, inventor of the world’s first zero carbon climate control system. All ELEMENTIS structures that require cooling utilizes Sun-Ice Energy’s technology, while all resorts and residences feature special insulated glass and construction techniques to optimize energy efficiency and ensure a healthy living environment.\nComplementing Sun-Ice Energy’s world-first climate-responsive technology, all ELEMENTIS resorts and residences are constructed from responsibly sourced glue laminated timber.\nAlso known as glulam, this engineered wood product is made by bonding thin layers of timber with eco-friendly, durable glue that is also moisture and pest resistant.

Most railway investments come with [a BEP] of more than 20 years,” Dwiyana explained.\nThe worsening economics surrounding the Jakarta-Bandung HSR only add to a list of issues pointing to an increasingly bleak future for the project.\nThe government announced last year that the project had exceeded its initial budget of US$6.07 billion by $2 billion. This prompted the issuance of a new regulation to allow for government funding and guarantees, which had been initially ruled out.\nThe government has injected Rp 4.3 trillion ($299 million) from the state budget through state-owned railway company PT KAI, funds that KCIC said it had used for overdue payments. More capital injections are needed to solve the cost overrun, but are pending an audit from the Development Finance Comptroller.\nIn January, President Joko Widodo announced that the operational date of the Jakarta-Bandung HSR had been pushed back six months to June 2023. KCIC later revealed that the delay was due to the project running into additional technical and geological difficulties.\nMeanwhile, KCIC said it had completed 10 of 13 tunnels, and that it planned to complete the remaining three by April.\nThese three tunnels are considered to be among the most difficult ones in the project and have been delayed for more than half a year.\nOther obstacles include the COVID-19 pandemic, with the project reporting almost 500 workers with the disease and another 1,500 in self-isolation.\nSyarif Abdullah Alkadrie, the deputy chairman of House Commission V overseeing infrastructure and transportation, questioned the fate of the project in light of the Nusantara capital city (IKN) development project, suggesting that the Jakarta-Bandung HSR could end up with zero passengers.\nHe pointed to other projects that had met a similar fate due to “misplanning”, like Kertajati International Airport in West Java and the light rapid transit (LRT) in Palembang.\n“Which is better, stopping or continuing [the project]? I'm worried that it will create more burdens [on the state budget],” said Syarif, who is from the NasDem faction.\nRail Transportation Director General Zulfikri told the same meeting that the Transportation Ministry would wait until KCIC submitted the updated feasibility study to determine any measures needed to support the project.\n“We will look at the assumptions used later, like the cost overrun, development delays and the pandemic. We are waiting and will see. If it is necessary, we will also amend the concession period,” Zulfikri said.\nHe added that the current concession period was 50 years from the issuance of the operational permit.\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nRelated Articles\nOvertourism or balanced development?

(Antara/Jessica Wuysang)\nW\norld Social Work Day (WSWD) is celebrated every year on the third Tuesday of March. It has become a high point in the social work calendar, with social workers worldwide, including in Indonesia, celebrating and promoting the profession's contributions to individuals, families, communities, and wider society.\nThis year’s theme, \"\nBuen Vivir\n: Shared Future for Transformative Change\", highlights the importance of social workers embracing community-led approaches grounded in indigenous wisdom and harmonious coexistence with nature for social transformation.\nThe concept of\nBuen Vivir\n, a Spanish word for “good living” or “living well,” originated from South American philosophy and has even been inscribed in the constitutions of Ecuador and Bolivia.&nbsp;It incorporates ideas of de-growth, austerity, and a stern critique of extractivism, which invokes limits in development. The idea emphasizes that humans are never owners of the earth and its resources, only stewards. Within the framework, those other futures we want must be well kept in check.\nSocial workers are important human resources in development. The distinguishing characteristic of social workers from other professions is their emphasis on the person-in-environment model and social justice.\nSocial justice is an integral part of social work and is strongly embedded in its value of equality. Including struggles for environmental justice within an environmental framework is a critical and significant part of social workers’ activities. It surfaces when redressing complex environmental degradation issues, vulnerability among marginalized populations, and disaster responses.\nThe Golden Indonesia 2045 Vision envisions Indonesia becoming a high-income country, the world's fourth or fifth largest economy by 2045, with near-zero poverty. The goal is set for 2045 since the republic will commemorate 100 years of its independence by then. Meanwhile, inequality is and will likely remain a key challenge threatening Indonesia’s future growth and prosperity.&nbsp;\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nInequality threatens long-term social and economic development, harms poverty reduction, and destroys people’s fulfillment and self-worth. Sustainable development cannot be achieved if individuals and communities are excluded from better access and contribution to social, economic, and political life. Therefore, reducing inequalities and ensuring no one is left behind are key to achieving all 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nRelated Articles\nThe rise of Islamic environmentalism and neoliberalism\nMoving up social workers with the ‘Buen Vivir’ wisdom&nbsp;\nHappy birthday, Pancasila; from Germany\nPreventing stadium tragedy through policy improvement\nOutlook darkens for Wall Street as Biden's regulators take shape\nRelated Article\nThe rise of Islamic environmentalism and neoliberalism\nMoving up social workers with the ‘Buen Vivir’ wisdom&nbsp;\nHappy birthday, Pancasila; from Germany\nPreventing stadium tragedy through policy improvement\nOutlook darkens for Wall Street as Biden's regulators take shape\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nMore in Opinion\nView more\nAcademia\nThe bottom-up wave of democratic rejuvenation\nAcademia\nPolice brutality: Fundamental problems in the institution\nAcademia\nFree trade deals increase Indonesian imports more than exports\nHighlight\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEditorial\nNarrow margin\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nThe Latest\nView more\nEconomy\nRI identifies 29 potential nuclear power plant sites\nEconomy\nChinese authorities are considering a weaker yuan as Trump trade risks loom, sources say\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia commences evacuation of 37 citizens in Damascus\nTech\nUS finalizes $6.1 billion Micron chip-making subsidy\nArchipelago\nTwo foreign visitors killed in tree collapse in Monkey Forest\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEconomy\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources\nRegulations\nBullion bank to launch in first half of next year, Airlangga says"

(AP/Mark Baker)\nS\nspan style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\"&gt;Sharing the same state religion, a docile way of living, and geographical links have all helped in maintaining a good relationship between Laos and Cambodia throughout their modern histories.\nA Cambodian diplomat and cultural expert commented as such when delivering a lecture in Vientiane on Tuesday ahead of marking the 60th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries on June 15.\nIn his opening remark Cambodian Ambassador to Laos Hos Sereythonh reminded everyone of the historical relations between the two nations in the era of King Fa Ngum, who grew up in a Khmer king's custody eventually becoming a son-in-law who united the region through the introduction of Buddhism and the creation of the kingdom of Lane Xang.\nThe Lao Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Institute of Foreign Affairs, Asia-Pacific and Africa Department, and the Cambodian Embassy in Laos jointly organized the lecture, with the Vice President of the Royal Academy of Cambodia and Director General of the International Institute of Cambodia, Sok Touch invited to deliver a lecture entitled: “Sixty Years of Cambodian-Lao Diplomatic Relations: Achievements and Ways Forward”.\nSok said, “Even though 1956 was regarded as the beginning of diplomatic relations between the two countries, the relations between our nations and people have started nearly a thousand year ago”.\n“These relations are based in the legacy of our ancestors and previous leaders of our two nations”, he added.\nSok also pointed to Buddhism, which the two countries share as a state religion, as a long-standing cultural bond.\n“The same traditions attached to the compassion and peaceful minded consciousness taught through Buddhism make the people of our two nations eternally brothers and sisters”, he said.\nHe shared his fascination with Buddhism in Laos suggesting that he wouldn't mind being ordained after he finished his diplomatic mission in Laos.\nHe also spoke to the years of Democratic Kampuchea rule in the late 1970s when the relations between the two countries were deteriorating, having been restored to close relations after the collapse of Khmer Rouge on Jan. 7, 1979.\nSok noted the two countries have also shared similar difficulties like the economic embargos by some of the world's super-powers during the Cold War.\nHe highlighted the bilateral relations between the two nations, which he said had been strengthened and expanded steadily in the recent years through exchange of frequent state visits between top leaders of Cambodia and Laos.\nHe remarked on both countries political cooperation, saying they supported each other both materially and spiritually and at regional and global levels.\nHe ended by saying Cambodia was highly appreciative of Laos' important contributions to their peace process over the past decade, while Laos was also appreciative of Cambodia's contribution to its national re-construction and defense, as leaders of both governments have also frequently mentioned.\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nRelated Articles\nNew governments mark a new chapter in Iran-Indonesia relations\nIndonesia, Vietnam relations: Shared vision and commitment\nIndia and Indonesia’s enhanced ties under new government\nA new horizon for closer Indonesia-Italy relations\nChina, Indonesia open a new chapter of building a community with a shared future\nRelated Article\nNew governments mark a new chapter in Iran-Indonesia relations\nIndonesia, Vietnam relations: Shared vision and commitment\nIndia and Indonesia’s enhanced ties under new government\nA new horizon for closer Indonesia-Italy relations\nChina, Indonesia open a new chapter of building a community with a shared future\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nHighlight\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEditorial\nNarrow margin\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nThe Latest\nView more\nEconomy\nRI identifies 29 potential nuclear power plant sites\nEconomy\nChinese authorities are considering a weaker yuan as Trump trade risks loom, sources say\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia commences evacuation of 37 citizens in Damascus\nTech\nUS finalizes $6.1 billion Micron chip-making subsidy\nArchipelago\nTwo foreign visitors killed in tree collapse in Monkey Forest\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEconomy\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources\nRegulations\nBullion bank to launch in first half of next year, Airlangga says"

(AFP/Kazuhiro Nogi)\nT\nhose who have watched\nThe Big Short\n, a comedy-drama film about the crash of the United States market in 2008, may be rather skeptical, or frightened by financial derivatives. The movie presented&nbsp;the innovative credit default swaps (CDSs) and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) that became the seeds of the US financial market turmoil.\nThe takeaway of the movie was that the haphazardly crafted financial derivatives instruments ended up&nbsp;endangering the whole system. Many scholars have similarly voiced post-2008 crisis precautions about the derivatives market regulations.\nThe late Prof. Lynn Stout of Cornell University argued that changes to the law had caused the market to crash. Stout identified a series of dynamics that removed legal constraints on speculative trading in over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives. The dynamics hence provided leeway for private actors to privately arrange OTC trading, which then became a catalyst for the capitalism&nbsp;beast of speculation.\nThe mixed feelings about derivatives are part of an overdue discourse. Derivatives are so lucrative they can engender Keynesian animal-spirited whims of the capitalist wallet, but the 2008 experience highlighted contusion in the derivatives. Despite this, derivatives have still proven useful for hedging (not speculations).\nJohn Finnerty of Fordham University has acknowledged the proper use of derivatives for improving economic efficiency and managing unwanted risk exposure. J.M. Keynes himself recognized that the market could provide benefits to societies that help facilitate investment, despite his seminal warning of “liquidity illusion” (that no such thing as market liquidity for everyone).\nFor emerging markets like Indonesia, derivatives market development is important. When the onshore derivatives market gets more lucrative, market participants will more actively hedge their financial position, thereby developing more efficient risk management and&nbsp;providing a&nbsp;space for market expansions.

(The Jakarta Post/Wienda Parwitasari)\nT\nhe construction of the Jakarta- Bandung high speed railway will focus on critical spots, such as tunnels, including the main tunnel in Halim, East Jakarta.&nbsp;\nState-owned construction firm Wijaya Karya (Wika) president director Tumiyana said construction and land acquisition had reached 15.03 percent and 96 percent completion, respectively.\n“We project that this year, we’ll be able to complete 60 percent of construction,” Tumiyana told the press after the company’s shareholders meeting in Jakarta, recently.\nConstruction of&nbsp;the 142.3-kilometer project is currently focusing on its tunnels, including the main tunnel in Halim, which is 1,885 meters long.\nThe railway project will have 13 tunnels, seven of which have started their excavation phase. Walimi in West Java was another critical spot for the project because the developer had to construct three tunnels with a total length of 7.44 kilometers.\nWika corporate secretary Puspita Anggraeni said the project had been divided into 115 development points, 32 of which were elevated projects, including bridges in Bekasi, West Java.\nPuspita said 42 points were under construction, including seven tunnels and a train depot in Tegalluar, Bandung.\nShe added that another 41 points were being prepared for the next construction phase.\nThe high speed train is designed to travel at a speed of 350 km per hour, about a 45-minute trip from Jakarta to Bandung.&nbsp; The developer aims to complete construction of the entire project by June 2021, a two-year delay from its original plan.

MH Thamrin and Jl. Sudirman (good access, security, cleanliness, adequate and safe parking, etc.), I am sure property owners and investors would rush to develop their properties.\nMaybe the management of the area should be put in contact with the property management company that manages urban developments such as the Sudirman Central Business District, the Taman Rasuna super block, or private/ community institutions, without the intervention of agencies that today run Kota Tua.\nIt works in Kuta, Bali and in New York, the US.\nTiua\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nRelated Article\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nFree trade deals increase Indonesian imports more than exports\nIndonesia’s tourist sector: A new era of innovation and growth\nPresident Prabowo should make Indonesia a global champion of democracy\nNew mosque in Nusantara to replace Istiqlal as state mosque\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nMore in News\nView more\nOpinion\nAnalysis: Govt adopts mandatory B35 biodiesel program as CPO prices tumble\nBusiness\nGlobal chip crunch stunts Indonesia car sales recovery\nBusiness\nXL profit falls in Q3 as tower sale income dries\nHighlight\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEditorial\nNarrow margin\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nThe Latest\nView more\nEconomy\nRI identifies 29 potential nuclear power plant sites\nEconomy\nChinese authorities are considering a weaker yuan as Trump trade risks loom, sources say\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia commences evacuation of 37 citizens in Damascus\nTech\nUS finalizes $6.1 billion Micron chip-making subsidy\nArchipelago\nTwo foreign visitors killed in tree collapse in Monkey Forest\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEconomy\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources\nRegulations\nBullion bank to launch in first half of next year, Airlangga says"

Moeldoko\n-\nJP/Ricky Yudhistira\nMarch 17, Online\nIndonesian Military (TNI) commander Gen. Moeldoko said on Tuesday that the government had discussed security matters relating to the government's plan to enact a visa-free policy for 30 countries to ensure that no security problems would arise.\nIn its efforts to bolster the weakening rupiah, the government recently announced that it would waive visa requirements for 30 countries as early as next month to boost tourism in order to net more foreign exchange income.\nYour comments:\nIt's getting funny to see the TNI trying to sneak its nose in or throw its rather unnecessary statements around on everything that's happening in this country lately.\nThey are kind of missing those good old days when they were relevant in the government.\nItsbad\nOf course there will not be any security threats now since the visa on arrival was given for a fee without any background check on the arriving tourist. So, in this respect, it stays exactly the same.\nDevineasia\nThere will, of course, still be a time limit for this visa, which when overstayed will open that person up to the same visa violations that exist. The only difference is tourists will save US$35 and perhaps feel a little more welcome when they arrive.\nMy biggest gripe about arriving in Indonesia is they never have any bloody pens to fill out your immigration cards with, and I often have to wander around until I can find someone to borrow one off. How much does maintaining a few pens on chains cost?\nLoro Blonyo\nThey have been ripping us off for years by charging for visas in US dollars and when they convert it to rupiah the exchange rate is nothing more than appalling. Where is Indonesia's pride? Surely if true to yourself you should transact in the rupiah and not US dollars.\nPacray\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nRelated Articles\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nFree trade deals increase Indonesian imports more than exports\nIndonesia’s tourist sector: A new era of innovation and growth\nPresident Prabowo should make Indonesia a global champion of democracy\nNew mosque in Nusantara to replace Istiqlal as state mosque\nRelated Article\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nFree trade deals increase Indonesian imports more than exports\nIndonesia’s tourist sector: A new era of innovation and growth\nPresident Prabowo should make Indonesia a global champion of democracy\nNew mosque in Nusantara to replace Istiqlal as state mosque\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nMore in News\nView more\nOpinion\nAnalysis: Govt adopts mandatory B35 biodiesel program as CPO prices tumble\nBusiness\nGlobal chip crunch stunts Indonesia car sales recovery\nBusiness\nXL profit falls in Q3 as tower sale income dries\nHighlight\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEditorial\nNarrow margin\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nThe Latest\nView more\nEconomy\nRI identifies 29 potential nuclear power plant sites\nEconomy\nChinese authorities are considering a weaker yuan as Trump trade risks loom, sources say\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia commences evacuation of 37 citizens in Damascus\nTech\nUS finalizes $6.1 billion Micron chip-making subsidy\nArchipelago\nTwo foreign visitors killed in tree collapse in Monkey Forest\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEconomy\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources\nRegulations\nBullion bank to launch in first half of next year, Airlangga says"

Northern Australia can breed and grow cattle at a lower cost compared to livestock farmers in Indonesia, while Indonesian feedlots can fatten Australian cattle at a lower cost than in Northern Australia. Indonesia can also slaughter Northern Australian cattle at a much lower cost than in Australia.\nWhen Australian cattle are slaughtered in Indonesia, the entire animal is used for productive purposes ' for example, skin for leather (Bandung ' shoes), provides significant 'added value' and employment to Indonesia. Indonesia's Agriculture Ministry's policy of 'self-sufficiency', with its quota system, has only led to 'rent seeking', as we have seen recently.\nAn Indonesian policy based on the principles of 'food security' would be more appropriate. This would involve the import of livestock/beef from Australia while seeking to make Indonesian domestic producers more competitive. The problem, as always, is to find the right balance between the interests of Indonesian producers and consumers.\nAccording to an article published in The Jakarta Post on July 20, the Indonesian Trade Ministry said that 'Indonesia will remove import quotas for beef and live cattle to stabilize domestic prices and curb inflation'. The proposed scheme, where parity or 'normal' prices are used to assess the need for imports, makes more sense than the quota system applied by the Agriculture Ministry.\nSuch a scheme is more in line with the concept of food security, as advocated by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and would probably be more acceptable to trading partners in the World Trade Organization.\nUnfortunately, much damage has already been done to Indonesian-Australian livestock trade, to the detriment of both Australian and Indonesian producers, as well as consumers. Irrespective of which party wins the next election in Australia (September 2013), the Australian government will likely restrict live cattle trade to Indonesia until more humane slaughter practices are in place.\nAll parties should be aware that the concept of halal slaughter is not limited to the method of slaughter alone, but more generally to the humane treatment of animals, as advocated by Prophet Muhammad (Hadiths). Australian abattoirs adhere to these halal practices ' Indonesia should adopt them also.\nThe bottom line is that Australia and Indonesia need to establish reliable, long-term relations in beef trade that respect the interests of both countries. My concern is that, if the Australian and Indonesia governments do not focus on 'reliable, long-term trade relations' in this sector, the Australian beef industry will establish longer-term trade relations with other more reliable trading partners in the Asian region.

He denies the charges.\nNevertheless, Bashir received a warm greeting from Xi, who told him he \"welcomes Sudan's participation in the Belt and Road\" and \"opposes foreign interference in Sudan's internal affairs\", the official Xinhua news service reported Sunday.\nChina has provided aid to Africa since the Cold War, but Beijing's presence in the region has grown exponentially with its emergence as a global trading power.\nChinese state-owned companies have aggressively pursued large investments in Africa, whose vast resources have helped fuel China's transformation into an economic powerhouse.\nWhile relations between China and African nations are broadly positive, concerns have intensified about the impact of some of China's deals in the region.\nDjibouti has become heavily dependent on Chinese financing after China opened its first overseas military base in the Horn of Africa country last year, a powerful signal of the continent's strategic importance to Beijing.\nLocals in other countries have complained about the practice of using Chinese labour for building projects and what are perceived as sweetheart deals for Chinese companies.\nThe concerns are likely to grow as countries in other parts of the world -- especially Southeast Asia -- begin to question whether Chinese aid comes at too high a price, prompting Malaysia, for instance, to cancel a $20-billion rail project last month.\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nRelated Articles\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources\nChina lifts final bans on Australian red meat as trade row nears end\nSilk Road of Art: Chinese cultural treasures from Shanghai to Jakarta\nIndonesia-Africa Forum: RI hopes for deals on energy, health\nTeam denies Prabowo's recent speech critical of Jokowi\nRelated Article\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources\nChina lifts final bans on Australian red meat as trade row nears end\nSilk Road of Art: Chinese cultural treasures from Shanghai to Jakarta\nIndonesia-Africa Forum: RI hopes for deals on energy, health\nTeam denies Prabowo's recent speech critical of Jokowi\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nMore in News\nView more\nOpinion\nAnalysis: Govt adopts mandatory B35 biodiesel program as CPO prices tumble\nBusiness\nGlobal chip crunch stunts Indonesia car sales recovery\nBusiness\nXL profit falls in Q3 as tower sale income dries\nHighlight\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEditorial\nNarrow margin\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nThe Latest\nView more\nPolitics\nGovt to make KPK sole graft-fighting agency\nEconomy\nRI identifies 29 potential nuclear power plant sites\nEconomy\nChinese authorities are considering a weaker yuan as Trump trade risks loom, sources say\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia commences evacuation of 37 citizens in Damascus\nTech\nUS finalizes $6.1 billion Micron chip-making subsidy\nArchipelago\nTwo foreign visitors killed in tree collapse in Monkey Forest\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEconomy\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources"

But he foreshadowed a \"brutal, bloody couple of weeks\" since Russian leader Vladimir Putin had \"everything at stake now [and] it's hard to see an elegant, or inelegant, dismount\".\nThe Kremlin describes its actions as a \"special operation\" to disarm Ukraine and unseat leaders it calls neo-Nazis. Ukraine and Western allies call this a baseless pretext for a war of choice that has raised fears of wider conflict in Europe.\n&nbsp;\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nRelated Articles\nChina to curbs exports of key chipmaking components to US\nTaiwan's Lai kicks off Marshall Islands visit as China fumes\nIs Beijing undermining Indonesia’s free and active foreign policy?\nIndonesia’s Delta Dunia to acquire Australian coal mines for $455m\nThe European Union and Prabowo's Indonesia: What’s changed?\nRelated Article\nChina to curbs exports of key chipmaking components to US\nTaiwan's Lai kicks off Marshall Islands visit as China fumes\nIs Beijing undermining Indonesia’s free and active foreign policy?\nIndonesia’s Delta Dunia to acquire Australian coal mines for $455m\nThe European Union and Prabowo's Indonesia: What’s changed?\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nMore in Paper\nView more\nOpinion\nAnalysis: Govt adopts mandatory B35 biodiesel program as CPO prices tumble\nBusiness\nGlobal chip crunch stunts Indonesia car sales recovery\nBusiness\nXL profit falls in Q3 as tower sale income dries\nHighlight\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEditorial\nNarrow margin\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nThe Latest\nView more\nPolitics\nGovt to make KPK sole graft-fighting agency\nEconomy\nRI identifies 29 potential nuclear power plant sites\nEconomy\nChinese authorities are considering a weaker yuan as Trump trade risks loom, sources say\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia commences evacuation of 37 citizens in Damascus\nTech\nUS finalizes $6.1 billion Micron chip-making subsidy\nArchipelago\nTwo foreign visitors killed in tree collapse in Monkey Forest\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEconomy\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources"

The armed conflict has intensified since the military coup started three years ago on Feb. 1, 2021. (AFP)\nT\nhree years after Myanmar’s military seized power from a democratically elected government, the armed conflict in the country might appear intractable.\nThe consequences have indeed been horrific: Tens of thousands of pro-democracy advocates have been killed, imprisoned or forced to flee their homeland. Villages have been decimated by the military’s aerial assaults on civilian populations. Escalating violence has fueled a humanitarian disaster, with over two and a half million people displaced and one in three in need of assistance, with the highest poverty rate in 15 years.\nIt would be a grave mistake – and a missed opportunity – for the international community to dismiss the Myanmar crisis as too difficult to resolve. The post-coup period has demonstrated that people in Myanmar will neither give in to fear or repression nor give up their struggle to freely choose their political leaders.\nThe regime’s divide and conquer tactics have failed.\nThose striving for democracy are stronger than ever. Anti-regime groups in different parts of the country have mounted, to date, the fiercest armed resistance to military rule. These developments have sharpened the choice for the regime: either risk more political and territorial losses or pursue an inclusive dialogue with all parties.\nTo pressure the military regime toward the path of peace and democracy, the United States has rolled out a series of targeted financial sanctions.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nLast June, we imposed sanctions against the regime-controlled Myanmar Foreign Trade Bank and Myanmar Investment Commercial Bank, a move that undercut the military’s ability to obtain foreign currency and purchase weapons from abroad.\nIn October, the US sanctioned the Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprise, the regime’s most lucrative state-owned company, curtailing a key source of US dollar revenues.\nThe US Congress did its part by passing the Myanmar Act, which supports additional steps to promote accountability for the regime’s abuses.\nThese actions, along with those of our European and Asian allies, have disrupted the Myanmar military’s ability to carry out atrocities and provided a powerful incentive for its leaders to change course.\nAt the same time, we are supporting the diverse coalition of ethnic, religious and political leaders working to build a federal democracy in Myanmar. The US has provided nearly US$400 million to help pro-democracy entities improve their governance capacity, develop local health and education policies, and refine plans for a political transition to civilian governance.\nIn my conversations with the pro-democracy National Unity Government and other actors in the opposition movement, it is clear they have come a long way toward agreeing on a shared vision for the future.\nSince the coup, the US has provided over $317 million in lifesaving assistance to people across Myanmar, through both international organizations and local partners. Our assistance has repaired hospitals and homes, evacuated injured civilians from conflict zones, supplied medicine and clean water, and fed children suffering from malnourishment.\nMuch of this assistance has reached those in ethnic areas along Myanmar’s borders, including those affected by the military’s ethnic cleansing against the Rohingya minority.\nMore must be done, and we urge the international community to press Myanmar’s military regime to allow unhindered access by humanitarian actors and build pathways across borders, so aid flows to those who need it most.\nLooking forward, we will continue to urge partners in the Indo-Pacific, particularly those in ASEAN, to redouble their efforts for a transition to an inclusive democracy and make progress on the ASEAN Five Point Consensus.\nWe will continue to encourage the United Nations Security Council, which adopted its first-ever resolution on the situation in Myanmar in December 2022, to use all tools at its disposal to support ASEAN’s efforts. This is what the people of Myanmar deserve, and it matters to the future of the entire region.\nThe destabilizing impact of the military regime has long been felt in Myanmar, but the consequences are increasingly affecting the broader region and the world. Conflict has turned Myanmar into the world’s largest opium producer, a hub of cyber scamming that uses forced labor to steal billions of dollars from foreign citizens and a driver of irregular migration flows that put migrants at risk.\nDespite the tragic events that unfold every day in Myanmar, we still envision a better future. We will still pursue an inclusive, democratically elected civilian government capable of delivering economic growth and promoting equality and justice under the law.\nWorking alongside our allies and partners, the United States will continue to help realize these possibilities and help fulfill Myanmar’s promise to become an inclusive, prosperous and democratic nation.\n***\nThe writer is the counselor of the United States Department of State.\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nRelated Articles\nPresident Prabowo should make Indonesia a global champion of democracy\nThe fall and rise of American democracy\nVietnam to build $67 billion high-speed railway\n12% VAT: A Fiscal solution or an economic burden on the middle class?\nPinning hopes on Danantara\nRelated Article\nPresident Prabowo should make Indonesia a global champion of democracy\nThe fall and rise of American democracy\nVietnam to build $67 billion high-speed railway\n12% VAT: A Fiscal solution or an economic burden on the middle class?\nPinning hopes on Danantara\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nMore in Opinion\nView more\nAcademia\nThe bottom-up wave of democratic rejuvenation\nAcademia\nPolice brutality: Fundamental problems in the institution\nAcademia\nFree trade deals increase Indonesian imports more than exports\nHighlight\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEditorial\nNarrow margin\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nThe Latest\nView more\nPolitics\nGovt to make KPK sole graft-fighting agency\nEconomy\nRI identifies 29 potential nuclear power plant sites\nEconomy\nChinese authorities are considering a weaker yuan as Trump trade risks loom, sources say\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia commences evacuation of 37 citizens in Damascus\nTech\nUS finalizes $6.1 billion Micron chip-making subsidy\nArchipelago\nTwo foreign visitors killed in tree collapse in Monkey Forest\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEconomy\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources"

The Philippines on the other hand has thrown its weight behind the new plan.\nOn Tuesday, Wang Yi said the AUKUS security pact brought hidden dangers to regional peace, stability and the international order.\nWang made the comments as he cochaired the latest round of the high-level strategic dialogue between China and the European Union alongside EU foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell, according to a statement from the Chinese foreign ministry, Reuters reported.\nCoordinating Maritime Affairs and Investment Minister Luhut Pandjaitan meanwhile called for deeper cooperation between the two countries, which he described as \"resilient\", especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\"The dynamics of the international situation nowadays have created multifaceted challenges that require stronger cooperation [...] The cooperation in mitigating the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is a testament to that resilience,\" Luhut said in his speech during the same event.\nLuhut also said that China and Indonesia could take the current relationship to a new height especially next year when Indonesia took over as chair of the Group of 20 leading economies.\nThe senior minister expected that President Xi could join the summit in person in Bali and take a tour around the country to see the progress in some of the infrastructure projects that are part of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).\n\"Next year when Indonesia holds the presidency of the G20, President Xi will be able to witness the implementation of several of our strategic projects. These projects started in 2014 when President Joko Widodo proposed his vision of a global maritime fulcrum, which relates profoundly to the concept of the Belt and Road Initiative, designed by China in 2013,\" Luhut said.

(JP/Wienda Parwitasari)\nT\nhe Finance Ministry has announced a plan to inject Rp 4.3 trillion (US$300.1 million) from the state budget into the Jakarta-Bandung high-speed railway project, so that construction of the infrastructure can continue.\nFinance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati told lawmakers on Monday that the funds were to cover capital that the consortium of four state-owned enterprises comprising the Indonesian side had failed to put up at the beginning of the project in 2015.\nThe largest equity commitment was from state-owned plantation company PTPN VIII with Rp 3.1 trillion, followed by state-owned toll road operator Jasa Marga with Rp 540 billion, state-owned railway company PT Kereta Api Indonesia (KAI) with Rp 440 billion and state-owned construction company Wijaya Karya with Rp 240 billion.\n“At the time, these four SOEs were confident that they could provide the required base equity. In reality, they were unable to deposit it,” Sri Mulyani said during a hearing at the House of Representatives, adding that it was actually their responsibility, as the project was a business-to-business (B2B) scheme.\nRead also:\nJakarta-Bandung high-speed train gets bigger govt backing after cost overrun\nSri Mulyani said this base equity was vital for the China Development Bank (CDB), acting as lender to the project, to disburse the required loan to proceed with the construction.\nThe project has been at the mercy of the CDB, which at one point decided it could no longer provide the necessary funding because of the missing equity.\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nRelated Articles\nAnalysis: SOEs superholding Danantara launch delayed, uncertainty looms\nHouse drafts bill to put Finance Ministry in charge of SOE dividends\nSOEs Ministry installs Prabowo’s protégé as Pertamina CEO\nChina’s diplomacy: Building a community with a shared future for mankind\nWhoosh prices to fluctuate with customer demand\nRelated Article\nAnalysis: SOEs superholding Danantara launch delayed, uncertainty looms\nHouse drafts bill to put Finance Ministry in charge of SOE dividends\nSOEs Ministry installs Prabowo’s protégé as Pertamina CEO\nChina’s diplomacy: Building a community with a shared future for mankind\nWhoosh prices to fluctuate with customer demand\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nMore in News\nView more\nOpinion\nAnalysis: Govt adopts mandatory B35 biodiesel program as CPO prices tumble\nBusiness\nGlobal chip crunch stunts Indonesia car sales recovery\nBusiness\nXL profit falls in Q3 as tower sale income dries\nHighlight\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEditorial\nNarrow margin\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nThe Latest\nView more\nEconomy\nRI identifies 29 potential nuclear power plant sites\nEconomy\nChinese authorities are considering a weaker yuan as Trump trade risks loom, sources say\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia commences evacuation of 37 citizens in Damascus\nTech\nUS finalizes $6.1 billion Micron chip-making subsidy\nArchipelago\nTwo foreign visitors killed in tree collapse in Monkey Forest\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEconomy\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources\nRegulations\nBullion bank to launch in first half of next year, Airlangga says"

Initiated by China, it was meant to assist developing countries in need of building infrastructure, which needs much funding and investment. But since its inception, the BRI has undergone changes to become a common endeavor of many countries and international organizations for joint cooperation in infrastructure projects.\nImmediately after its inception, it was recognized that the BRI should be broadened beyond infrastructure development, and include cooperation on trade, finance and people-to-people relations to get off the ground effectively. As the program has become very big and all-encompassing, it has become a global effort.\nAt the Second BRI Forum held on April 24 to 26 in Beijing, 126 countries and 29 international organizations signed BRI cooperation agreements. This, indeed, marked an important development\nMeanwhile, with the participation of countries, including think tanks and research institutions, both national and international, much feedback and intellectual support has been received by the Chinese government and other institutions through the efforts of the Development Research Center of the State Council (DRC), which oversees the cooperation of think tanks, called the Silk Road Think Tank Network (SiLKS) set up in 2017.\nSince then the Chinese government has welcomed more feedback and input on the BRI, and acknowledged that BRI cooperation should be open, transparent, zero-tolerance for corruption and a green initiative of its programs with sustainability in mind. Through these efforts, the DRC and Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) Indonesia conducted joint research on Indonesia’s participation in the BRI and what it means for Indonesia’s economic development.\nThe study has been delivered to both governments as important feedback and for Indonesia it has become input for building public awareness. At the beginning, the BRI idea was skeptically received by the public, but following dissemination of the study and the improved programs, public opinion has turned around.\nIn this context, the efforts taken in creating wider networking and cooperation among think tanks as initiated by the Xinhua Institute were welcomed by all invited think tanks and their readiness to participate in this new initiative, the Belt and Road Studies Network (BRSN).\nIf and when some emerging economies do not have enough capacity to conduct their own studies for their participation in the BRI, the BRSN can provide assistance and support.\nIn light of United States President Donald Trump’s initiative for “America First” principles in US foreign policy, which rejects multilateralism, and to put its own economy first, it is imperative for others to cooperate closer in order to fill in the gaps or lacuna in the global economic order created by such a unilateralist policy. One of form of cooperation is the BRI strategy as initiated by China but which is meant for the international community as a whole.\nThe participation of more countries and institutions in the BRI has improved the idea for open, transparent, zero tolerance for corruption, green and sustainable cooperation. For this purpose, the BRI also invited developed countries to join, so the BRI could really serve as a force for global cooperation and integration, and to maintain the global system as best as possible. The alignment of the BRI with 29 international cooperation agreements is of critical importance to its functioning as reinforcement of international order.\nWhat is most important in China’s effort through the BRI, under its theme of “Building a community with a shared future for mankind”, is access to market and technologies. In summary, China will have to engage in benefaction in order to secure strong support from other economies. Sharing the Chinese market and technology resources particularly with developing BRI economies is apparently a very good strategy.\nMeeting the challenges of inclusive and sustainable development is a herculean task to perform irrespective of the levels of policy-making one talks about. In theory, the best approach to such development is well-shared, distributed technology progress in all areas of application: information and communication technologies (ICT), genetic engineering, artificial intelligence and technology-enhanced culture.\nWith ICT, farmers can trade with far-away places at reduced transaction costs. With genome engineering, agricultural and animal husbandry productivity can be raised multiplicatively, health care can be improved and the burden of diseases reduced. Digitalization of culture such as augmented reality raises the tradability of culture within and across borders. In all these new technologies, China is one of the recognized leaders.\nChina should leverage that technology leadership to advance the BRI. “Techno BRI” with diverse windows of cooperation should be made an important block of the BRI. Each window would be opened to participation to all countries on carefully negotiated terms and conditions of participation.\nIn designing and implementing “Techno BRI”, lessons can be drawn from European Union technology programs and enriched with Chinese experiences with the ideation, research and development, prototyping, acquisition of intellectual property, incubation and start-up and up-scaling. Success in “Techno BRI” will contribute to sustainable catching up, allowing developing economies to grow at higher added value and technology leaders to reap greater benefits from their hard-earned technological advantage.\n***\nThe writer is the vice chair, board of trustees, CSIS Foundation.\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nRelated Articles\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nIndonesia should think twice about joining BRICS and OECD\nChina to curbs exports of key chipmaking components to US\nChina lifts final bans on Australian red meat as trade row nears end\nHarnessing historical narratives for national pride, unity\nRelated Article\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nIndonesia should think twice about joining BRICS and OECD\nChina to curbs exports of key chipmaking components to US\nChina lifts final bans on Australian red meat as trade row nears end\nHarnessing historical narratives for national pride, unity\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nMore in Academia\nView more\nAcademia\nThe bottom-up wave of democratic rejuvenation\nAcademia\nPolice brutality: Fundamental problems in the institution\nAcademia\nFree trade deals increase Indonesian imports more than exports\nHighlight\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEditorial\nNarrow margin\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nThe Latest\nView more\nPolitics\nGovt to make KPK sole graft-fighting agency\nEconomy\nRI identifies 29 potential nuclear power plant sites\nEconomy\nChinese authorities are considering a weaker yuan as Trump trade risks loom, sources say\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia commences evacuation of 37 citizens in Damascus\nTech\nUS finalizes $6.1 billion Micron chip-making subsidy\nArchipelago\nTwo foreign visitors killed in tree collapse in Monkey Forest\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEconomy\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources"

The third debate covered issues of international relations, defense and security. (Antara/Aditya Pradana Putra)\nThe recent presidential debate, centered around the Indonesia’s position in international affairs, may not have captivated the public, who often prioritize issues like the economy and corruption. However, the candidates' views on foreign policy offer a profound insight into their broader vision for Indonesia's role on the world stage.\nWorldviews in international relations typically fall within two major spectra: Hobbesian and Grotian. The Hobbesian perspective, rooted in realism, perceives the state position at the global level through the lenses of military and economic might. It is a self-help system where states prioritize their own survival and interests, measuring their influence by material capabilities.\nFor middle powers, this translates into an influence shaped by military strength and economic resources in an environment rife with inevitable conflict. This also implies an influence directly proportional to their military prowess and economic clout.\nIn such a competitive arena, a middle power like Indonesia is compelled to continuously expand its economic and military capabilities. This relentless pursuit of growth and strength is perceived as the only route for a middle power to garner respect and assert its presence internationally.\nContrastingly, the Grotian perspective emphasizes legal norms and institutions. It highlights how the state can wield significant influence beyond mere material power. This approach underscores the power of diplomatic engagement, coalition-building and active participation in shaping international norms and leading initiatives in human rights and environmental stewardship.\nPower here is not just about material capabilities but also the capacity to shape ideas and lead in the global community. For a middle power, this means actively engaging in regional and global agenda-setting, becoming a norm entrepreneur and fostering solidarity that resonates with other nations. In this context, the power of ideas and diplomatic finesse is deemed crucial for gaining respect and influence at the global level.\nPresidential candidate\nAnies Baswedan\naligns with the Grotian worldview. His approach to power is multifaceted, extending beyond traditional domains to include cultural influence. He champions the concept of soft power, where influence is exerted through cultural appeal, political values and foreign policy.\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nRelated Articles\nReengineering culture to sustain Prabowo’s leadership\nForeign policy will support domestic agenda: Minister\nASEAN in the global economy: A half-century journey\nMass casualty attacks in China put focus on mental health as economy slows\nIndonesia touts China sea deal without concession\nRelated Article\nReengineering culture to sustain Prabowo’s leadership\nForeign policy will support domestic agenda: Minister\nASEAN in the global economy: A half-century journey\nMass casualty attacks in China put focus on mental health as economy slows\nIndonesia touts China sea deal without concession\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nMore in Opinion\nView more\nAcademia\nThe bottom-up wave of democratic rejuvenation\nAcademia\nPolice brutality: Fundamental problems in the institution\nAcademia\nFree trade deals increase Indonesian imports more than exports\nHighlight\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEditorial\nNarrow margin\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nThe Latest\nView more\nEconomy\nChinese authorities are considering a weaker yuan as Trump trade risks loom, sources say\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia commences evacuation of 37 citizens in Damascus\nTech\nUS finalizes $6.1 billion Micron chip-making subsidy\nArchipelago\nTwo foreign visitors killed in tree collapse in Monkey Forest\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEconomy\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources\nRegulations\nBullion bank to launch in first half of next year, Airlangga says\nMiddle East and Africa\nAirline pilots, crews voice concerns about Middle East routes"

Jayakumar, Thailand’s Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva, Vietnam’s Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung, President of the Republic of Indonesia Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, Prime Minister of Cambodia Hun Sen, Brunei Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah, Prime Minister of Laos Thongsing Thammavong, Prime Minister of Malaysia Najib Razak, and President of Myanmar Thein Sein pose for a photograph at the opening of the 18th ASEAN Summit at the Jakarta Convention Center, on May 7, 2011. JP/Ricky Yudhistira\nThe Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or ASEAN, was established on Aug. 8, 1967 in Bangkok, Thailand, with the signing of the ASEAN Declaration (Bangkok Declaration) by the founding fathers of ASEAN, namely Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore and Thailand.\nBrunei Darussalam then joined on Jan. 7, 1984, Vietnam on July 28, 1995, Laos and Myanmar on July 23, 1997, and Cambodia on April 30, 1999, making up what is today the 10 member states of ASEAN.\nThe ASEAN Vision 2020, adopted by the ASEAN Leaders on the 30th Anniversary of ASEAN, agreed on a shared vision of ASEAN as a concert of Southeast Asian nations, outward looking, living in peace, stability and prosperity, bonded together in partnership in dynamic development and in a caring community.\nWhen the group was founded in 1967, it was a loose regional organization. In its journey after four decades, ASEAN now has a complete charter, which gives it a legal entity, and a grand design to build an ASEAN Community that is a caring and sharing society.\nAt the 9th ASEAN Summit in 2003, ASEAN Leaders resolved that an ASEAN Community shall be established to create a stronger ASEAN to accomplish this mission and bring peace and prosperity to its 600 million people.\nAll the members agreed to build the community with three pillars — ASEAN Political-Security Community (APSC), ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) and ASEAN Socio-Cultural Community (ASCC) — by 2015.\nEach pillar has its own blueprint, and, together with the Initiative for ASEAN Integration (IAI) Strategic Framework and IAI Work Plan Phase II (2009-2015), they form the Roadmap for and ASEAN Community 2009-2015.\nAt the 12th ASEAN Summit in January 2007, the Leaders affirmed their strong commitment to accelerate the establishment of an ASEAN Community by 2015 and signed the Cebu Declaration on the Acceleration of the Establishment of an ASEAN Community by 2015.\nSimultaneously, ASEAN is creating a common political platform to formulate a common perception regarding global issues. Indonesia put forward a new initiative for the 2011 ASEAN chairmanship, the ASEAN Community in a Global Community of Nations. It is an appropriate move and a first step in the right direction, especially to address the challenges that will emerge after 2015.\nAccording to CSIS executive director Rizal Sukma, ASEAN must introduce a sanctions mechanism in implementing the ASEAN agenda.\n“Member states must change the ASEAN Charter to include a sanctions mechanism. Then and only then will ASEAN progress. Currently it is voluntary to implement ASEAN agreements,” Rizal said.\nASEAN’s main weakness as well as strength is its diversity. There is a huge difference among member countries in terms of incomes, human capital, political systems, institutions and infrastructure etc.\nThe biggest challenge for ASEAN is how to involve people in the core processes of ASEAN. There is no representation of “the people”. There is a notion that it is an organization of officials. Indonesia, the current chair of ASEAN, wants to change this perception and to give more say to the people in ASEAN affairs.\n“We want ASEAN to be a people-centered, people-oriented and people-driven organization. People should benefit from ASEAN, then and only then is it meaningful,” Foreign Ministry’s director-general of ASEAN Cooperation Djauhari Oratmangun said.\nAs the 2011 global financial and fiscal crises in Europe and America continue to afflict countries and economies across all regions in all continents, the crises have led to growing perceptions in Asia that the distribution of power in global political, economic and security circles is leading to important alignments between the Atlantic and East Asia, said Juwono Sudarsono, professor of international relations and geopolitics at the University of Indonesia.\n“As the meeting point of the Northeast Asia and Southeast Asia nexus, the upcoming ASEAN Summit in Bali presents a strategic opportunity for countries in the region to co-determine the terms and conditions of these ongoing power shifts. Now, more than ever before, hard military power depends on smart fiscal soundness, financial strength, market performance and political resilience.”\n“ASEAN leaders in government, business and the defense-security services have vital roles in preparing next generation political, business and security leaders able to map out networks of collaboration throughout Southeast Asia. Foreign, home, trade and finance ministry officials need to hone their knowledge and gut instincts to enhance leadership skills combining political, economic and military “situational awareness” with higher levels of “professional competence”.\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nRelated Articles\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nFree trade deals increase Indonesian imports more than exports\nIndonesia’s tourist sector: A new era of innovation and growth\nPresident Prabowo should make Indonesia a global champion of democracy\nNew mosque in Nusantara to replace Istiqlal as state mosque\nRelated Article\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nFree trade deals increase Indonesian imports more than exports\nIndonesia’s tourist sector: A new era of innovation and growth\nPresident Prabowo should make Indonesia a global champion of democracy\nNew mosque in Nusantara to replace Istiqlal as state mosque\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nMore in News\nView more\nOpinion\nAnalysis: Govt adopts mandatory B35 biodiesel program as CPO prices tumble\nBusiness\nGlobal chip crunch stunts Indonesia car sales recovery\nBusiness\nXL profit falls in Q3 as tower sale income dries\nHighlight\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEditorial\nNarrow margin\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nThe Latest\nView more\nPolitics\nGovt to make KPK sole graft-fighting agency\nEconomy\nRI identifies 29 potential nuclear power plant sites\nEconomy\nChinese authorities are considering a weaker yuan as Trump trade risks loom, sources say\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia commences evacuation of 37 citizens in Damascus\nTech\nUS finalizes $6.1 billion Micron chip-making subsidy\nArchipelago\nTwo foreign visitors killed in tree collapse in Monkey Forest\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEconomy\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources"

This is an enormous opportunity as our market is projected to double to US$2 trillion by 2030.\nThe council endorsed working toward carbon neutrality, including growing industries in the green, blue and circular economy. We are working on positioning the region as a global electric vehicle production hub and enhancing environmental management.\nPlus, in response to the global crisis, we advanced strengthening food security and nutrition.\nDeepening regional and global market integration, and strengthening efforts toward a single, seamless market by 2045, continue to be our overarching focus. To this end, we are investing in education, skills and healthy innovation systems, removing non-tariff barriers to trade, and promoting cross-border technology-led investment.\nThis will enable our industries and businesses to be more integrated and make higher value-added contributions to global value chains. By doing so, we can boost incomes and revenues throughout the region, and achieve our goal of becoming highly competitive, with equitable, cohesive and resilient economic development.\nAs we near the end of the ASEAN 2025 Blueprint, the council emphasized that we can no longer continue with business as usual. To strengthen competitiveness and productivity, member states need to accelerate the pace and scale of domestic policy reform.\nOur community must work harder to close the development gaps between member states and sub-national regions so that we move forward together. Furthermore, we are determined to work diligently to ensure our cooperation modalities are fit for purpose and that we have the necessary tools to future-proof our region.\nWe are now charting a path to develop the ASEAN Post-2025 Vision, which will guide the region's economic development for decades to come. With the global trade system at a standstill and concerns about de-risking value chains, ASEAN will explore new approaches.\nWe must continue strengthening our trade architecture, not only to increase our resilience but to reinforce more inclusive globalization.\nIt is crucial to have a strong and united ASEAN Economic Community for the stability and prosperity of our region in the long term.\nAs we move forward together, we should strive to protect our traditional strengths while adapting to the changing strategic landscape. ASEAN centrality and connectivity are essential, especially for safeguarding the region’s strategic independence.\nI am confident that ASEAN is transforming into a global engine of growth, which reflects Indonesia’s chairing theme “ASEAN Matters: Epicentrum of Growth”.\nHowever, we must take proactive measures to shape a future where Southeast Asia is recognized for its agility, innovation, people-centred approach and ability to deliver inclusive and sustainable economic growth while maintaining resilience.\n&nbsp;***\nThe writer is chair of\nthe\nASEAN Economic Community Council and Indonesian&nbsp;\nc\noordinating economic minister.\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nRelated Articles\nConsumers upbeat on RI economy in November, but spending boost unlikely\nEurope’s economy is stalling out\nActivists protest rejection of dog and cat meat trade ban\nIndonesia urges countries to halt economic activities with Israel\nXi, Biden attend APEC summit, prepare to meet\nRelated Article\nConsumers upbeat on RI economy in November, but spending boost unlikely\nEurope’s economy is stalling out\nActivists protest rejection of dog and cat meat trade ban\nIndonesia urges countries to halt economic activities with Israel\nXi, Biden attend APEC summit, prepare to meet\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nMore in Opinion\nView more\nAcademia\nThe bottom-up wave of democratic rejuvenation\nAcademia\nPolice brutality: Fundamental problems in the institution\nAcademia\nFree trade deals increase Indonesian imports more than exports\nHighlight\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEditorial\nNarrow margin\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nThe Latest\nView more\nPolitics\nGovt to make KPK sole graft-fighting agency\nEconomy\nRI identifies 29 potential nuclear power plant sites\nEconomy\nChinese authorities are considering a weaker yuan as Trump trade risks loom, sources say\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia commences evacuation of 37 citizens in Damascus\nTech\nUS finalizes $6.1 billion Micron chip-making subsidy\nArchipelago\nTwo foreign visitors killed in tree collapse in Monkey Forest\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEconomy\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources"

(AFP/Rahmat Mirza)\nT\nwelve refugees have committed suicide in the past two years. Dozens of other are on the edge of suicide as hundreds of mental health cases become active monthly across refugee communities.\nThe latest suicide took place last March in Tanjung Pinang refugee community. Three months later, it was followed by another unsuccessful attempt. Many have linked the incidents to the recent lockdown we faced due to the high number of COVID-19 cases—nearly 200 out of 400 refugees were infected, all confined to live in a 500-square-meter area.\nWhat underlies suicide attempts among refugees is far more profound and complicated than the pandemic alone. COVID-19 may strike refugees in a suicidal mood, but the actual roots of the suicide include living for years with an obscure future, chronic distress over the debilitating situation of their families in conflict areas back in their countries of origin, and being ostracized from the normal way of living in the host community.\nIndonesia is increasingly becoming a graveyard for refugees who are taking their lives because of prolonged statelessness. According to a recent report from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, 13,497 refugees live in Indonesia, and the majority sought asylum in 2013 and 2014. Each year, fewer than 5 percent of refugees get resettled to a third country.\nThat small likelihood of success distances the refugees from their future. As human beings, we live our present time with the perception of the future in mind and experience of the past in our behavior. Imagine, going to sleep each night with the thoughts that you cannot return to your origin country — facing the threat of guns, nor look toward a promising future, resettlement.\nLiving at peace in the presence of your family seems more unattainable with every day that passes. For 365 days, those thoughts might be upsetting and increasingly lead to despair. After 1,000 days, those thoughts move beyond upset and despair to depression—and from there finding relief in a rope around one’s neck, which is why refugees begin to take their lives after three to four years trapped in statelessness.\nIf 1,000 days turn into 2,500 days, you may ask why all refugees have not hanged themselves rather than questioning why a refugee attempts suicide.\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nRelated Articles\nIndonesia’s tourist sector: A new era of innovation and growth\n20 years of the Aceh tsunami: From ‘megathrust’ threat to disaster mitigation\nAuthorities to relocate thousands around Lewotobi after eruptions\nBroadening the prospects for shared future of China-ASEAN community\n‘Bullied’ medical resident at Diponegoro University commits suicide\nRelated Article\nIndonesia’s tourist sector: A new era of innovation and growth\n20 years of the Aceh tsunami: From ‘megathrust’ threat to disaster mitigation\nAuthorities to relocate thousands around Lewotobi after eruptions\nBroadening the prospects for shared future of China-ASEAN community\n‘Bullied’ medical resident at Diponegoro University commits suicide\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nMore in Academia\nView more\nAcademia\nThe bottom-up wave of democratic rejuvenation\nAcademia\nPolice brutality: Fundamental problems in the institution\nAcademia\nFree trade deals increase Indonesian imports more than exports\nHighlight\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEditorial\nNarrow margin\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nThe Latest\nView more\nPolitics\nGovt to make KPK sole graft-fighting agency\nEconomy\nRI identifies 29 potential nuclear power plant sites\nEconomy\nChinese authorities are considering a weaker yuan as Trump trade risks loom, sources say\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia commences evacuation of 37 citizens in Damascus\nTech\nUS finalizes $6.1 billion Micron chip-making subsidy\nArchipelago\nTwo foreign visitors killed in tree collapse in Monkey Forest\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEconomy\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources"

He said that what China had to avoid was embarking on an old strategy that was no longer valid for the future, such as happened in Europe at the end of the 19th century, which resulted in the outbreak of World War I. China had to remain free of power politics, the Cold War and hegemonic competition.\nAs we are experiencing today, elements of competition exist, but so do elements of cooperation and coordination in big-power relations, making the idea of hegemonic competition almost impossible.\nEconomic interdependence and, to a certain extent, global and regional integration have prevented that from happening. In addition, developing nations have developed and modernized, becoming an important part of the world and making hegemonic economic dominance impossible for the last half decade.\nFor China, which might become the world’s biggest economy by GDP in the next 10 years or so, its biggest challenges will be how to behave and how its role should be formulated as a big economic power. &nbsp;\nIn this effort, China must also take huge domestic problems into consideration, as well as its dependence on natural resources, energy and advanced technology.\nChina has no ambitions to become a global superpower, because it recognizes its limitations and willingness to run other parts of the world.&nbsp; This has never been an ambition of China throughout history. China has always been big. Its ambition is mainly to be recognized by others, and not to run over or to subdue others.\nAdmittedly, Southeast Asia or ASEAN’s member nations have their differences in their respective policies toward China. However, in general, the region accepts that China is an important and strategic partner and that economically China is and will become more important. Historically, China has always been accepted and recognized as an important country in the region, and the region has to pay attention to the nation. &nbsp;\nIf hegemony is almost impossible, then China’s peaceful rise has to be taken as the best strategy for China and for the region. A peaceful rise in connection with regional institutions might be just the right strategy for China and the East Asian region, because they share common interests, although strengthening bilateral relations is also of paramount importance.\nIn concrete terms, the first step needed to solidify the common interests of ASEAN and China is the creation of a Code of Conduct (CoC) on the South China Sea based on the accepted Declaration of Conduct (DoC) of the South China Sea. The idea is to establish a regional mechanism to prevent conflict or to overcome or manage conflicts if they arise. This CoC is not intended to resolve overlapping claims, but to create an atmosphere for stability and peace, and in doing so make it easier to find a solution in the future. &nbsp;\nAchieving such results in the South China Sea would have a good follow-on effect on the East China Sea problems of the Daiyou/Senkaku Islands claimed by both China and Japan. Those two nations should be encouraged to engage in joint cooperation as was promised before but never implemented.&nbsp; Here, China should be more moderate and nuanced in its actions and reactions, while Japan must accept that these problems are historical and related to the end of World War II. It is important to encourage centrist-oriented policies on World War II legacy issues. Otherwise, it will make resolving the issues more complicated for the whole East Asia region.\nChina and Japan have to establish direct lines of communications between their leaders, political and military, and put in place arrangements to prevent incidents that could develop into conflicts or wars in the future. Trust, in the end, has to be established by both sides. &nbsp;\nThe US role and policies should also be commensurate with the nuances of the region. The US pivot toward East Asia was not a thought-out policy, but instead is the result of a wrong gut reaction that was obviously misinterpreted by the Chinese, as the pivot started with US security increases in the region. The US should have well-rounded presence in the region, especially in economic terms.\nRegional common interests also cover the economic field.&nbsp; In trade, both the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) and Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) can be complementary, if the US is willing to lower the TPP threshold, while the RCEP should raise its threshold to become more meaningful for the region to participate. Only then the most maximum results can be achieved for the benefit of the region. Neither China nor the US should exclude anyone.\nIf the aforementioned policy changes can be adjusted, then there is no reason why China’s strategy for a peaceful rise based on shared common interests can be carried out and well accepted.\nThe writer is vice chairman of the board of trustees at the Centre for the Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) Foundation.\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nRelated Articles\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nFree trade deals increase Indonesian imports more than exports\nIndonesia’s tourist sector: A new era of innovation and growth\nPresident Prabowo should make Indonesia a global champion of democracy\nNew mosque in Nusantara to replace Istiqlal as state mosque\nRelated Article\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nFree trade deals increase Indonesian imports more than exports\nIndonesia’s tourist sector: A new era of innovation and growth\nPresident Prabowo should make Indonesia a global champion of democracy\nNew mosque in Nusantara to replace Istiqlal as state mosque\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nMore in News\nView more\nOpinion\nAnalysis: Govt adopts mandatory B35 biodiesel program as CPO prices tumble\nBusiness\nGlobal chip crunch stunts Indonesia car sales recovery\nBusiness\nXL profit falls in Q3 as tower sale income dries\nHighlight\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEditorial\nNarrow margin\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nThe Latest\nView more\nPolitics\nGovt to make KPK sole graft-fighting agency\nEconomy\nRI identifies 29 potential nuclear power plant sites\nEconomy\nChinese authorities are considering a weaker yuan as Trump trade risks loom, sources say\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia commences evacuation of 37 citizens in Damascus\nTech\nUS finalizes $6.1 billion Micron chip-making subsidy\nArchipelago\nTwo foreign visitors killed in tree collapse in Monkey Forest\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEconomy\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources"

The government has accelerated vaccination programs ahead of Idul Fitri in May, when many people leave the capital and return back to their hometowns. (AFP/Adek Berry)\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has taught us many things about ourselves and the world, but one of the clearest, most important lessons is that the world can and must be better prepared for future pandemic threats.&nbsp;\nSolidarity, multilateralism, shared knowledge and technological strength are essential elements as we seek to emerge from COVID-19 and to build a world capable of protecting itself from another pandemic.\nIndonesia and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness (CEPI) have a shared vision for a new global health architecture that can prepare the world to face future pandemic threats. That vision is centered on minimizing and ultimately ending pandemic threats, and it is built on of the need for greater global resilience, greater and more accessible financing, greater commitment to technology and scientific capacity, and above all, greater international collaboration.&nbsp;\nIndonesia and CEPI share the goal of fostering an international approach to the scientific research and development work needed to create tools that can significantly reduce future epidemic and pandemic risks.\nBuilding this new and dynamic system will require the commitment of every government in every region of the world, and Indonesia is leading those efforts through its Group of 20 presidency. As president of the G20 during 2022, Indonesia has been instrumental in the creation of the new Financial Intermediary Fund (FIF) for Pandemic Prevention, Preparedness and Response (PPR), which has now raised more than US$1 billion from a number of far-sighted national and institutional donors.&nbsp;\nThe creation of the FIF, which has CEPI as one of its implementing partners along with the Global Fund and Gavi, represents a vital and concrete step in the building of a more resilient, more prepared global health system.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nThe FIF will provide a dedicated stream of additional, long-term financing for PPR as well as a critical platform for coordination. The money in this fund will also, in part, be used to support fair, equitable and swift access to medical countermeasures such as vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics in the event of a looming pandemic threat.&nbsp;\nTo secure that equitable access, governments and the private sector must cooperate to ensure that capabilities to develop and produce countermeasure are widely distributed, robust, and scalable in the event of a public health emergency. This will require significant expansion and geographical diversification of global manufacturing and research capabilities in all regions.\nThrough its G20 presidency, Indonesia envisions would like to see greater standardization or regionalization of manufacturing and research hubs, not just in the Global North, but also in the Global South. Vaccine equity has proved an elusive goal throughout the COVID-19 pandemic and will remain so until we create sustainable research and vaccine manufacturing facilities in lower- and middle-income countries across the world.\nAs it prepares to hold its annual board meeting in Bali during Indonesia’s G20 presidency, CEPI is uniquely placed to help governments alike and international organizations work together to strengthen the world’s defenses against disease threats. And together we are urging governments and financing bodies to collaborate on mobilizing the investments needed in national health systems, in capacity expansion for vaccines, diagnostics and other medical defenses, and in outbreak response plans.\nDeeper cooperation is needed, too, in the fields of surveillance, data sharing and standards. Indonesia, as G20 president, is actively encouraging the development of virus-related data sharing collaborations between countries&nbsp;through the G20 Forum. Laboratory expertise such as the identification, characterization and genetic sequencing of new, emerging and mutating pathogens must also be integrated and shared around the world.&nbsp;\nProgress against these goals will be necessary if we are to meaningfully accelerate the development of countermeasures in the future and CEPI applauds Indonesia’s leadership and wholeheartedly supports Indonesia’s efforts in these regards.\nTo be leaders in health security and play their part in the global community, countries need to strengthen cooperation and learn the lessons of the COVID-19 pandemic. Indonesia and CEPI are committed to helping nations come together for peaceful cooperation that extends beyond the COVID-19 crisis, building global capacity and systems and ensuring sustained political, financial, and societal commitment over years and decades to come.\nOnly by investing in what matters will the world bolster global health security and protect itself and its people against future pandemics.\n&nbsp;***\nBudi Gunadi Sadikin is Indonesian health minister.

It is also encouraging that the MSG will go on a fact-finding mission to West Papua. The media can play a role in this by hopefully being allowed by the authorities to accompany the fact-finding mission as a way of showing the openness of the process.

The institutional category is meant to denote water services provided by ordinary water utilities (PDAM) whereas the “community-based” category is meant to denote water services provided by local community associations.\nThe community category is predominantly found in rural Indonesia, although in some cases it is also applicable in urban settings untouched by PDAM services. According to some sources, while the majority of PDAM are currently ailing and in financial trouble, the community category has been very successful and now constitutes more than half of Indonesia’s total water services.\nIn many ways, the community category — supported by the 2003 policy — has been a successful endeavour of the government, local communities and donors. Nevertheless, there are problems with both the concept and implementation of the community-based system that threatens its sustainability.\nAlthough cited in various documents by donor institutions, the typology made by the 2003 policy, which categorizes water services into “institutional” and “community” categories, is flawed.\nThis is because the community is also a form of institution and delivers water services through formal organisations.\nThe second problem is the term “community” itself. What do we mean by it? Perhaps the term community is used to distinguish from other entities such as corporations. But what if, for example, a particular local community owned shares in a water corporation? Could we not say that the corporation was community-based?\nThe third problem is the notion of community ownership. Many donors and water activists assume that community ownership is self-explanatory in practice.\nThe assumption is that when a donor institution disburses funds to build water service infrastructure in remote villages, the community will “own” that infrastructure. This is incorrect.\nThe truth is that the so called “community” in the context of water services cannot be legally identified. Therefore, water services assets can only be owned by a legal entity and not directly by the individuals of\nthe community.\nFor example, an individual in a village does not directly own a communal toilet. He or she can “own” a toilet via the entity that owns it, such as a cooperative, a foundation or an association that has been\naccorded legal entity status, or even a corporation.\nThus, the notion of community ownership is flawed, for it is not the community that owns water services assets, but the legal entity in which the individuals of the community can be members.\nIn this respect, the key issue is whether the legal entity owning the water assets is sufficiently democratic in terms of its decision making process.\nThe questions that donor institutions should ask are whether women are adequately represented and whether marginal groups’ access to water is guaranteed.\nActivists need to be wary of power politics and whether patriarchal relations are embodied into legal entities. This is done by evaluating the entity’s articles of association and its application.\nThe fourth problem is with respect to its assets. I said earlier that a community can only “own” water services assets through a legal entity. Under the Indonesian legal system, the process of forming a legal entity is very cumbersome and can take up to more than a year.\nVillage communities often do not have means at their disposal to handle this. In one research project, I found no clarity as to who owned the infrastructure assets built by donor funds.\nThe fifth problem relates to the fourth, namely, its operation and maintenance. Without clarity on asset ownership, no one is responsible for maintenance.\nIn turn, assets will be abandoned by the population due to a lack of maintenance. Ownerless assets also mean that they are vulnerable to confiscation or expropriation from third parties, like developers or powerful village figures.\nThe sixth problem relates to incoherencies in the national legal framework. Due to (unproductive) debates on water privatization, the government prioritises PDAM to provide water services in Indonesia and leaves the community and private sector only a secondary role. As a result, there is a lack of recognition and standards for non-PDAM services in national law.\nThe trend now is for some regions to enact regional bylaws on community-based water services and due to problems number three and four above, resort to village government to own and maintain assets.\nHowever, the bylaw is often inconsistent with national legislation and often there are areas of overlap and even clashes between PDAM and community-based water services.\nFurthermore, resorting to villages — which in a way, are state instruments — means that we are moving away from community-based water and back toward traditional state provision.\nThe community-based water system has (so far) been a tremendous success in improving access to water in Indonesia and the credit goes partially to donor funds.\nBut without a clear conceptual framework, without clarity on who owns and who is able to own assets and without support from national legislation, the sustainability of community-based water services is of great concern.\nThe writer, who obtained a PhD from the University of Dundee, lectures at Ibn Khaldun University’s school of law in Bogor, West Java.

(asean.org/-)\nI\nn the past five years, the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) has become a global public good with vitality and creativity. To date, more than 150 countries and international organizations have signed BRI cooperation agreements with China.\nUnder the BRI, 82 overseas economic cooperation zones have been set up in the participating countries in a short period. Trade between China and BRI partner countries has exceeded US$6 trillion. The more than $80 billion in Chinese investment in these countries has created 240,000 local jobs.\nWhy has the BRI been so popular and won so much support? To sum up, first, it follows the principle of equality and mutual benefits. Second, it aims for a win-win outcome. Third, it is open and inclusive. Fourth, it synergizes development strategies. Fifth, it is based on rules and the rule of law.\nASEAN is the key direction and important participant in the BRI. In the past five years, a large number of cooperation projects between China and ASEAN countries have been incorporated into the BRI cooperation framework. More and more practical cooperation plans are being actively explored.\nThere are advantages of China and ASEAN’s cooperation under the BRI. First is political advantage. The Belt and Road cooperation requires solid political mutual trust. The political relationship between China and ASEAN is very strong, evident in the fact that China is the first dialogue partner of ASEAN to accede to the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation in Southeast Asia and to forge a strategic partnership with ASEAN.\nLast year, both sides issued the China-ASEAN Strategic Partnership Vision 2030, which laid out a medium-and long-term blueprint.\nLeaders from China and ASEAN countries have maintained close exchanges. At the annual China-ASEAN Summit, the leaders will hold candid discussions on common concerns and make political decisions to ensure that bilateral cooperation proceeds on the right path. Strengthening synergy between the ASEAN development strategy and the BRI has become the consensus of leaders of both sides.\nSecond is institutional system advantage. Under the China-ASEAN cooperation mechanism, the two sides have developed effective cooperation in over 20 fields, such as connectivity, finance, agriculture, information and communication technology, human resources development, investment, energy, culture, tourism, public health, environment and subregional development. China and ASEAN should strengthen BRI cooperation to bring these dialogue mechanisms into full play.\nChina has established a mechanism of dialogue at the vice-premier level or at the ministerial level with several ASEAN countries. Any bilateral cooperation under the BRI can be fully coordinated and promoted through intergovernmental dialogue.\nChina has also signed bilateral investment agreements with several ASEAN countries. There are insurance mechanisms for bilateral cooperation, without “traps” as claimed by the West. Everything runs under the sun; conspiracy theory is untenable.\nThird is geographical advantage. China and ASEAN countries are close neighbors linked by mountains, rivers and seas. We are a community with a shared future and share weal and woe on the road to common development and prosperity. This has been fully verified by the handling of the two financial crises in 1997 and 2008 with the joint efforts of China and ASEAN.\nAmid rising unilateralism and trade protectionism, China and ASEAN need to work together to seek common development. It is of overriding importance for us to seek self-development, mutually beneficial cooperation and maintain regional sustainable development and prosperity. The BRI cooperation has built a new platform and points to a new direction for China-ASEAN future comprehensive and pragmatic cooperation.\nASEAN is committed to promoting the implementation of the Master Plan on ASEAN Connectivity 2025, which is consistent with the BRI goal to promote regional connectivity. If the two initiatives are successfully synergized, the ASEAN connectivity project will get more support from China and the rest of the world, which will improve its commercial value and meet its long-term development goals.\nFourth is market advantage. China and ASEAN together are a big market with over 2 billion people. Annual trade between them nears $600 billion and total mutual investment has exceeded $200 billion. The financial cooperation, including currency swap arrangements, has also achieved remarkable results.\nPeople-to-people exchange has exceeded 50 million per year, a huge improvement from the past. But it may be just the beginning for the market potentials.\nIn the next 15 years, China’s imports of goods and services are expected to exceed $30 trillion and $10 trillion, respectively. For ASEAN, the next 15 years will also be an important opportunity to expand cooperation with China and accelerate its own development.\nThe Belt and Road cooperation provides a viable opportunity for the integration of the two markets. The two sides have the ability and conditions to tap market potential, mobilize various resources, expand cooperation in various fields and implement mutually beneficial measures to strengthen the win-win situation.\nFifth is people-to-people exchange advantage. China and ASEAN countries have a history of people-to-people exchange. The two sides share similar cultures and customs. The Belt and Road cooperation will help improve infrastructure, expand trade exports, improve people’s employment and living standards, and will certainly gain the understanding and support of people on both sides.\nNearly 30 million Chinese tourists visit Southeast Asia every year. This number will rise with improved infrastructure connectivity. The number of ASEAN tourists visiting China will also increase quickly. The youth are the future and hope for China-ASEAN relations. About 200,000 Chinese and ASEAN students study in each other’s home countries. They are valuable treasures and will surely become the backbone of the BRI.\nChina and ASEAN deserve all the advantages from jointly building the Belt and Road, and will also work together to write a brand new chapter for win-win cooperation in the future.\n***\nThe writer is vice president of the China Public Diplomacy Association\n.\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nRelated Articles\nPrabowo’s great power politics pivot takes center stage\nASEAN, Canada work together for health security\nCampaign #ForABetterWorld recognized as awe-inspiring #MadeinIndonesia app by Google Play\nWong’s ASEAN consolidation\nIndonesia named BRICS partner as Prabowo’s top diplomat makes overseas debut\nRelated Article\nPrabowo’s great power politics pivot takes center stage\nASEAN, Canada work together for health security\nCampaign #ForABetterWorld recognized as awe-inspiring #MadeinIndonesia app by Google Play\nWong’s ASEAN consolidation\nIndonesia named BRICS partner as Prabowo’s top diplomat makes overseas debut\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nMore in Academia\nView more\nAcademia\nThe bottom-up wave of democratic rejuvenation\nAcademia\nPolice brutality: Fundamental problems in the institution\nAcademia\nFree trade deals increase Indonesian imports more than exports\nHighlight\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEditorial\nNarrow margin\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nThe Latest\nView more\nPolitics\nGovt to make KPK sole graft-fighting agency\nEconomy\nRI identifies 29 potential nuclear power plant sites\nEconomy\nChinese authorities are considering a weaker yuan as Trump trade risks loom, sources say\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia commences evacuation of 37 citizens in Damascus\nTech\nUS finalizes $6.1 billion Micron chip-making subsidy\nArchipelago\nTwo foreign visitors killed in tree collapse in Monkey Forest\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEconomy\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources"

(asean.org/-)\nT\nhe latest data from China’s Customs Administration shows two-way trade between China and ASEAN grew by 14.1 percent to a record US$587.87 billion in 2018, compared to 2017. China has been ASEAN’s top trading partner for 10 consecutive years, while ASEAN has been China’s third largest trading partner, after the European Union and the United States, for eight years in a row.\nASEAN, among China’s top seven trading partners in 2018, and China experienced the fastest growth rate of trade last year. Against the slowdown of global economic growth and the prevalence of trade protectionism, the two-way trade between the two parties continues to maintain a sound momentum and it stands head and shoulders above other major trade relations.\nWe also note that the gap between China-ASEAN trade volumes and China-US trade volumes narrowed significantly by about 33 percent from $68.9 billion in 2017 to $457 billion in 2018. This only confirms the huge potential and “late-starting advantage” of China-ASEAN trade.\nAt the same time, as ASEAN’s premier power Indonesia has had increasingly closer trade relations with China. In 2018, Indonesia’s trade with China grew by 22.2 percent to $77.4 billion, the fastest of the 10 ASEAN member states. In particular, sales in China of imports from Indonesia grew significantly to 19.6 percent, a rate only second to the sales in China of imports from Vietnam.&nbsp;\nAccording to the data of China’s Ministry of Commerce, mutual investments continued to increase. In 2018, China’s direct investment flows to ASEAN’s non-financial sectors totaled $9.95 billion, with a year-on-year growth of 5.1 percent, which was faster than the 1.7 percent increase in the previous year. ASEAN investment flows to China were worth $5.72 billion, with a year-on-year growth of 12.5 percent, well above the growth rate of 3.88 percent seen in the previous year.&nbsp;\nBy the end of 2018, China invested $89.01 billion in ASEAN and ASEAN invested $116.7 billion in China, a 22-fold increase in two-way investment in 15 years, especially as China’s investment in ASEAN accelerated.\nThe aforementioned data shows that China and ASEAN are not only good neighbors and good friends. China is also one of ASEAN’s most important trade and investment partners and vice versa. China-ASEAN trade relations are in complete harmony.&nbsp;\nIn 2018, they celebrated the 15th anniversary of the establishment of a strategic partnership. China and ASEAN have joined hands in a new era of greater progress and the relations have developed from a growth stage into a mature stage.\nAs for the next 15 years, President Xi Jinping has proposed to forge a higher level of China-ASEAN strategic partnership and move toward a closer China-ASEAN community with a shared future, pointing out the main direction for the development of bilateral relations. At the 21st China-ASEAN Summit in November last year the two sides issued the China-ASEAN Strategic Partnership Vision 2030, which laid out medium- and long-term plans for future cooperation.&nbsp;\nAs Premier Li Keqiang pointed out during the summit, so long as we firmly confirm our confidence in each other’s development, in bilateral cooperation and in the future of East Asia and work closely together to forge ahead, China-ASEAN relations would surely make greater achievements in the next 15 years and benefit the people of all countries in the region.\nThe rapid development of China-ASEAN economic and trade relations is the result of the joint efforts of governments, enterprises and people from both sides. It can be said our trade relations have got all the advantages.\nIn 2018, the growth rate of China’s total imports and exports along the “Belt and Road” countries was 13.3 percent, which was higher than that of the China’s overall global trade by 3.6 percent. In the same period, the non-financial direct investment of Chinese enterprises along the “Belt and Road” countries was worth $15.64 billion, with a year-on-year growth rate of 8.9 percent, which is 8.6 percent higher than China’s global investment growth rate.&nbsp;\nASEAN is a key area for jointly building the “Belt and Road” and it was in Indonesia that President Xi proposed the important initiative to build the “21st Century Maritime Silk Road” in 2013. As more and more “Belt and Road” cooperation projects are steadily advancing and bearing fruit in ASEAN countries, the potential of trade cooperation between China and ASEAN under the “Belt and Road” framework would continue to be realized.&nbsp;\nIt would be a strong impetus for trade and investment on both sides and would benefit more and more enterprises and people in this region in the future. China is going to hold the Second Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation this year.\nLast November, China hosted the first China International Import Expo (CIIE), where President Xi delivered the keynote speech during the opening ceremony. All ASEAN countries sent high-ranking delegations and high-quality companies to attend the expo.\nBeing the world’s first national-level expo solely for imports, the CIIE demonstrates China’s determination to further open its market to the world. It has also opened a new door for the world’s high-quality goods to enter China’s huge market. It is believed that as the CIIE would be held continually in the future, more and more ASEAN companies would benefit from it.&nbsp;\nIn addition, multilateral and bilateral free trade arrangements have also boosted China-ASEAN economic and trade exchanges. The upgraded protocol of China-ASEAN Free Trade Agreement took effect on Jan. 1. The new rules of origin are more flexible and convenient in the determination of the origin, which would help companies from both sides enjoy more tariff preferences and promote trade between the two sides.&nbsp;\nThe negotiations for the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement, joined by both China and ASEAN, are also expected to conclude in 2019. It is believed that the agreement would be a new booster for the development of China-ASEAN economic and trade relations to leap forward.\nChina is going to hold the second Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation this year. The Belt and Road Initiative was proposed by China and the results of cooperation are benefiting the whole world.&nbsp;\nIn the process of promoting international cooperation in the future, we are willing to strengthen strategic synergy with ASEAN on the basis of the following principles: to seek shared benefits through consultation and collaboration; to ensure transparency, openness and tolerance and abide by international laws and international norms, to promote cooperation projects adhering to high standards, high quality and high levels and to establish financial, environmental and ecological sustainability.&nbsp;\nIt is believed that cooperation between the two sides would continue to deepen and bear more fruit, while the sustainability of development would be enhanced.\n***\nThe writer is Chinese ambassador to ASEAN.\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nRelated Articles\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nVietnam's soaring US trade surplus stokes new fears of tariffs\nChina to curbs exports of key chipmaking components to US\nTaiwan's Lai kicks off Marshall Islands visit as China fumes\nICC’s arrest warrant for Myanmar junta chief is a critical step forward\nRelated Article\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nVietnam's soaring US trade surplus stokes new fears of tariffs\nChina to curbs exports of key chipmaking components to US\nTaiwan's Lai kicks off Marshall Islands visit as China fumes\nICC’s arrest warrant for Myanmar junta chief is a critical step forward\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nMore in Academia\nView more\nAcademia\nThe bottom-up wave of democratic rejuvenation\nAcademia\nPolice brutality: Fundamental problems in the institution\nAcademia\nFree trade deals increase Indonesian imports more than exports\nHighlight\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEditorial\nNarrow margin\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nThe Latest\nView more\nPolitics\nGovt to make KPK sole graft-fighting agency\nEconomy\nRI identifies 29 potential nuclear power plant sites\nEconomy\nChinese authorities are considering a weaker yuan as Trump trade risks loom, sources say\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia commences evacuation of 37 citizens in Damascus\nTech\nUS finalizes $6.1 billion Micron chip-making subsidy\nArchipelago\nTwo foreign visitors killed in tree collapse in Monkey Forest\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEconomy\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources"

Women's empowerment and the next generation are keys to sustainable community improvement and the future of cocoa farming.\nCourtesy of Mondelez International\nBy engaging multiple partners in its Cocoa Life program, Mondelez International supports farming communities in finding real solutions that lead to transformation and sustainability.\nA corporate approach allowing farmers to share their problems has become increasingly popular these days as companies want to make their community assistance programs run effectively.\nThrough shared problems, such as infertile land, low yields and poor access to a market, for example, companies can design a program that meets the farmers' needs, which they commonly undertake under their respective sustainability initiatives.\nMany companies, however, are apt to focus on one or two areas in regard to the relevant aid they give through an average three-year project. Its has led to the frequently raised question as to whether a program has a significant impact on the farming communities in the context of sustainability.\nGiven the increasingly varied and complex issues facing farming communities, the right strategies and approach are therefore needed by companies to significantly contribute to a long-term impact on sustainable farming.\nThis explains why global chocolate company, Mondelez International, is currently running Cocoa Life in six cocoa-producing countries, including Indonesia, with a holistic approach being adopted to support sustainable cocoa supply. Under the holistic approach, a range of concerns facing farming communities are handled through a focus on five pillars: farming, community, livelihood, youth and environment.\nCocoa Life is a holistic sustainability program that reinforces the future of cocoa by empowering today's farming communities and inspiring tomorrow's cocoa generations. Globally, it started three years ago and in Indonesia, it kicked off in September 2013, with the program aimed at cocoa'farming communities in Sumatra, Sulawesi and Papua.\nCocoa Life is part of the Call for Well-Being strategy - a platform that Mondelez International uses as a reference in running their business and ensuring environmental safety.\n'Call for Well-Being is the company's commitment to marrying sustainability with company growth. This strategy helps Mondelez operate a more sustainable business, not only for us but also for the environment in countries where we operate,' said Mondelez Indonesia's managing director Jiri Hejl.\n'As the world's largest chocolate company, we are committed to supporting the success of Cocoa Life and helping ensure a qualified and sustainable cocoa supply.'\nMondelez International's Cocoa Program Development Manager for Southeast Asia, Andi Sitti Asmayanti (Yanti), explained that Cocoa Life aimed to strengthen and develop cocoa farmers in Indonesia and ensure sustainable cocoa by embracing young generations around farming sites to become the next farming generation.\nThe 10-year program will run until 2022, targeting more than 200,000 farmers in the six countries, with more than 40,000 farmers in Indonesia.\nTo reach the goal, Cocoa Life works based on three principles: holistic farmer centric, partnership and sourcing alignment.\n&nbsp;'Whatever we do with Cocoa Life is intended for farmers and should be seen from the standpoint of farmers, what they really want, so we do not apply top-down but a bottom-up approach in this regard,' said Yanti.\nAccording to Yanti, Mondelez, through its partners, is frequently engaged in a discussion with farmers and local governments in the respective provinces to learn their perspectives on what value Cocoa Life will have for farmers, and 'certainly from our side what benefits farmers will reap from this program. From the standpoint of productivity, the farmers can adopt the knowledge they have gained to boost their output. We also provide much-needed fertilizer and other plant materials, etc.'\nWith the current insignificant role of women in the life of farming communities, efforts should be made to empower women because they have a vital role in developing the next cocoa-farming generation. While, with regard to the environment, 'the challenge is how to boost production without causing damage to the environment,' she said, adding that each pillar was interrelated.\nMulti-partners\nIn implementing the program, Mondelez engages many partners to enable the program to develop and scale up sustainable cocoa supply so as to meet the objectives. Each pillar entails relevant expertise from the respective partners, which include local and international NGOs.\nBy creating partnerships with communities, governments, national and international NGOs and supply-chain partners, 'we can support Cocoa Life communities in finding real solutions that lead to measurable transformation,' the company says.\n'Partnerships are vital for best practice, sustainability, synergy and scale ' they bring competence related to the program objectives ' institutions and connectivity with our supply chain. We believe partnership is the key to lasting change,' it says.\nApart from partners representing experts in the respective five pillars, the program is also being run in partnership with government bodies including the Ministry of Agriculture, Coordinating Economic Ministry and Indonesian Coffee and Cocoa Research Institute.\nYanti emphasized the importance of transparency in the program in the sense that the partners with their respective fields of expertise work to take a look at the existing issues based on their respective areas.\n'For example, at the level of adoption. They have to find out how the farmers do the farming and find the best ways of farming,' she said.\nShe described farmers' various problems and challenges in each targeted province following an assessment by its partner, CARE Indonesia, an international NGO whose key programmatic area of focus includes economic empowerment.\nWhen Cocoa Life entered Lampung, local cocoa farmers had abandoned their land, which they considered unproductive following the last yields of their cocoa trees that have a life span of between 25 and 30 years, but after receiving education under the Cocoa Life program, they began to realize that the area had more choices in terms of land for cocoa farming.\n'Based on input that they gave, they have frequently received training and so we assess the extent of the level of knowledge they have and we adjust our training to this level,' she said. 'The biggest challenge in this regard is to invite them to join the program and see how the program can give added value to them.'\nWhile in Sulawesi, most farmers are already knowledgeable about cocoa agriculture and so 'our great challenge is how to conduct training and at the same time adopt theory into practice on the ground. Room training is conducted for approximately seven days and the rest is direct training in the cocoa farms.'\nEach area is similar in terms of measuring activities through the key performance indicators (KPI) and the difference rests on the program focus, which will depend on the stakeholders, according to Yanti.\nVerification\nTo ensure that Mondelez runs the program in a correct way, the program is subject to verification by an independent party after three years, apart from internal monitoring and annual evaluation.\n'A Harvard University team conducts research on the program to verify the program itself, whether it has an impact or not, without Mondelez's intervention,' said Yanti, adding that they could publish their research results without Mondelez's approval.\nAccording to CARE International Indonesia's Country Director, Helen Vanwell, the independent verification of the program supports Cocoa Life's commitment to the objectives and the KPI that have been set-out.\n'Verifying Cocoa Life's impact on the lives of cocoa farmers and their communities, especially women and youth will build greater confidence to increase participation in the program and benefit more communities to join,' she pointed out.\nOn the role that CARE Indonesia plays in the program, Vanwell said that while CARE looked at farming issues in the assessment, 'our key focus was on communities including women and youth. Mondelez through its Cocoa Life program and CARE know that enabling resilient, thriving communities are essential foundations for sustainable cocoa thus benefiting all stakeholders including communities and providing shared value for all.\n'If for example there are no opportunities for youth in cocoa-livelihood opportunities, and to assist a cocoa community they leave, then cocoa farming will not survive,' she said.\n'Cocoa Life aims to identify livelihood opportunities and to assist cocoa communities in building communities that are desirable places to live including for young families.'\n'The Cocoa Life program is a good example of how global corporations like Mondelez can transform a business challenge around sustainability of their cocoa supply to provide development solutions that positively impact the lives of thousands of cocoa farmers in their supply chain,' she added.\n_________________________\nPartners for Change\nThis page is produced by\nThe Jakarta Post\nin cooperation with Company-Community Partnerships for Health in Indonesia (CCPHI).

Yudo Margono (front left), former commander of Joint Defense Regional Command I, inspects Indonesian troops on Jan. 3, 2020, at a military base in Natuna Islands regency, the Riau Islands, in this handout photo provided by the Indonesian Military (TNI). (AFP/Handout)\nO\nn Sunday, several Indonesian and foreign diplomats texted me to express their shock over the 14-point joint statement, especially point 9, issued after the summit between Chinese President Xi Jinping and visiting President\nPrabowo Subianto\nin Beijing on Saturday. They were curious if Prabowo would reverse Indonesia’s long-standing position on China’s nine-dash line in the South China Sea, or if it was simply a show of negligence from our side.\nA veteran Indonesian diplomat asked, “Could this be interpreted as Indonesia recognizing China's nine-dash line and undermining its own sovereignty, or just going it alone?” He continued, “Joint development cooperation in the overlapping waters claimed by the two countries [makes it] seem like we are giving legitimacy to PRC maritime claims.”\nA senior journalist deems that the Foreign Ministry’s long-standing position on the South China Sea and Natuna waters must change in line with the vision of Prabowo, a former Army general.\n“Watch out for more changes in long time foreign policy positions under Prabowo. Diplomats and military see things differently,” he said in a WhatsApp group conversation.\nThe joint statement is called the “Joint Statement Between the People's Republic of China and the Republic of Indonesia on Advancing the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership and the China-Indonesia Community with a Shared Future”.\nOn point 9, the two leaders do not explicitly refer to the tensions between the two countries in the North Natuna waters. The 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) grants Indonesia the sovereign right to exploit resources in the waters as its exclusive economic zone (EEZ), but China claims that the area has been the fishing ground of its seafarers for thousands of years.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nAccording to the joint statement: “Both sides emphasized maritime cooperation as an important component of the comprehensive strategic cooperation between China and Indonesia.

(AFP/Patrick Semansky)\nT\nhis week the United States will be hosting an online “Summit for Democracy”, which is claimed to “focus on challenges and opportunities facing democracies” and to “defend democracy and human rights at home and abroad”.\nUnfortunately, it might turn out to be nothing but an attempt to divide the world into opposing political camps and advance the US’ own strategic agenda with democracy as an excuse. If so, the meeting couldn’t be further away from the spirit of democracy.\nChina firmly opposes the move by the US, one that is dominated by the Cold War mentality and which seeks to incite ideological confrontation and risks creating new dividing lines in the international community.\nWith this summit, the US seeks to empower itself to determine who is democratic and who is not based on its own liking and measure the merits of other countries’ democracy with its own yardstick. This is, in fact, privatization and labeling of democracy and will make the “Summit for Democracy” itself undemocratic.\nThe world today is facing pressing global challenges such as an ongoing pandemic and climate change, and some countries, including the US, are troubled by a worsening democracy and many domestic problems. Under such circumstances, countries have every reason to prioritize the needs of the people, advocate unity and cooperation, and strive for development and progress.\nPerhaps the last thing a responsible major country should do is to turn a blind eye to its own problems and scapegoat others politically. Ironically, it is the people who have to pay the price at the end of the day.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nWhile upholding democracy at home, countries should also support greater democracy in international relations, uphold the UN-centered international system and the international order based on international law. Efforts are also urgently needed to practice true multilateralism and make global governance more inclusive. These are the shared aspirations of the international community and meet the trend of our times. Unfortunately, the upcoming summit in the US will in no way advance these goals, except for making itself a disruptive factor.\nChina believes that democracy means, in essence, that people are the masters of the country. Democracy is practiced to meet people’s needs, bringing the people a decent and happy life and progress for the country and beyond.\nHaving seen a number of successful and failed cases of democracy worldwide, countries across the world must have come to realize one thing, that is, true democracy will only dawn when it is deeply rooted in a country and fits well with its own national conditions and stage of development.\nEfforts to mechanically copy the political systems and democratic models of others have never worked and never will. Neither do attempts to impose one’s own political will on others.\nWhen it comes to China’s case, the Chinese people have followed the political development path with Chinese characteristics and created the model of whole-process people’s democracy. The people enjoy the right to democratic elections, decision-making, management and supervision in accordance with the law.\nAnd the fundamental principle of putting people at the center is well applied to every policy and measure that will affect people’s daily lives. This specific model of democracy works well in China, as it has been proven to be capable of solving China’s problems and thus greatly supported by the Chinese people.\nWhen it comes to the international arena, China proposes to forge a new type of international relations featuring mutual respect, fairness, justice and win-win cooperation, building a global community with a shared future for mankind and striving for greater democracy in international relations.\nUnfortunately, regarding the US, it has continued to claim that it is a “beacon of democracy” and “model of democracy” over the years, despite the structural flaws and problematic practices of its democratic system. It is the American people who are paying the heavy price for its rampant racial discrimination, enlarging social divide and widening wealth gap at home.\nHowever, none of these have discouraged the US from interfering in other countries’ internal affairs, waging war under the guise of “democracy”, lecturing others on democracy in a condescending manner and creating regional turbulence and humanitarian disasters.\nThe US hosting of the “Summit for Democracy” follows the same logic behind the formation of some new regional groupings, including the Quad and AUKUS. With these moves, one thing is for sure: the US is still deeply obsessed with the Cold War mentality.\nAmid attempts to provoke confrontation or division in the region and beyond, China will work with other countries in the world to champion mutual respect, promote win-win cooperation and pursue peaceful coexistence and shared prosperity of nations, regardless of differences in social systems, ideologies, histories, cultures and stages of development.\n&nbsp;***\nThe writer is the Chinese ambassador to ASEAN.\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nRelated Articles\nTrump says anyone investing $1 billion in US will receive expedited permits\nHow Syria rebels' stars aligned for Assad's ouster\nIndonesia should think twice about joining BRICS and OECD\nDevelopments of Indonesia’s OECD accession journey\nIndonesia urges countries to halt economic activities with Israel\nRelated Article\nTrump says anyone investing $1 billion in US will receive expedited permits\nHow Syria rebels' stars aligned for Assad's ouster\nIndonesia should think twice about joining BRICS and OECD\nDevelopments of Indonesia’s OECD accession journey\nIndonesia urges countries to halt economic activities with Israel\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nMore in Opinion\nView more\nAcademia\nThe bottom-up wave of democratic rejuvenation\nAcademia\nPolice brutality: Fundamental problems in the institution\nAcademia\nFree trade deals increase Indonesian imports more than exports\nHighlight\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEditorial\nNarrow margin\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nThe Latest\nView more\nPolitics\nGovt to make KPK sole graft-fighting agency\nEconomy\nRI identifies 29 potential nuclear power plant sites\nEconomy\nChinese authorities are considering a weaker yuan as Trump trade risks loom, sources say\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia commences evacuation of 37 citizens in Damascus\nTech\nUS finalizes $6.1 billion Micron chip-making subsidy\nArchipelago\nTwo foreign visitors killed in tree collapse in Monkey Forest\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEconomy\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources"

(Reuters/Soe Zeya Tun)\nT\nhe 22nd ASEAN-China Summit is to be held in Thailand on Sunday. Amid the profound and complex changes in the international and regional landscape, the following questions raise increasing attention in the East Asian community and beyond: How is the ASEAN-China relationship doing? What will the Summit do to ASEAN-China relationship and regional cooperation?\nA review of history unveils the extraordinary journey of cooperation and development between ASEAN and China since the establishment of our dialogue relationship 28 years ago and our strategic partnership 16 years ago. As Chinese President Xi Jinping pointed out in his congratulatory letter to the opening ceremony of the Year of ASEAN-China Media Exchanges last February, ASEAN-China relations have entered a new stage of all-round development.\nOur relationship is forging ahead on a clearer path and with ever-growing strategic mutual trust. Leaders of both sides have been charting the course, for instance, President Xi’s proposal of building a closer-knit ASEAN-China community with a shared future.\nOur two sides enjoy frequent high-level bilateral visits. And a highlight moment came when leaders of all ASEAN countries and the ASEAN Secretariat attended the Second Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation last April. Their collective attendance spoke volume of our deep mutual trust at the highest official level.\nEconomic and trade cooperation between our two sides has grown steadily. When global economic growth slowed down and trade protectionism gained track in 2018, the ASEAN-China trade volume reached a record high of US$587.8 billion, a year-on-year increase of 14.1 percent. In the first half of 2019, ASEAN overtook the United States to become China’s second-largest trading partner for the first time, and our trade volume of the whole year is expected to reach $600 billion.\nFriendly people-to-people exchanges are getting ever more prosperous. Last year saw a total of 57 million mutual visits and nearly 4,000 flights every week between our two sides. China is the largest source of tourists for ASEAN countries, and more people from ASEAN countries come to work or study in China.\nConcrete steps have also been taken by China and ASEAN countries to enhance trust and manage differences in the South China Sea.\n&nbsp;\nThe two sides will declare the year 2020 as the Year of ASEAN-China Digital Economic Cooperation.\n&nbsp;\nWe have been actively advancing the consultations on the Code of Conduct in the South China Sea (COC) and completed the first reading of the single draft text ahead of schedule.\nThis is the latest major progress in the COC consultations and an important step toward the vision to conclude the consultations in three years.\nASEAN and China are working closely on international affairs. We have been jointly moving forward the negotiations on the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (RCEP) — one of many efforts to uphold the rules-based multilateral trading system and oppose protectionism and unilateralism.\nWe stay true to our common values of openness, inclusiveness and mutual learning between civilizations. We step up communication to address hot spot issues and maintain regional peace and stability. We are also joining hands at the subregional level to advance Lancang-Mekong cooperation and the cooperation between China and the Brunei-Indonesia-Malaysia-Philippines — East ASEAN Growth Area.\nThe ASEAN-China Summit will contribute significantly to our strategic relationship, in the following five aspects in particular.\nFirst, greater synergy between our development plans will be created. The ASEAN-China Strategic Partnership Vision 2030 adopted at the ASEAN-China Summit last year unfolded a blueprint for the mid- and long-term development of our ties.\nUnder its guidance, both sides are making great strides in the synergy and cooperation of the Belt and Road Initiative and the Master Plan on ASEAN Connectivity 2025.\nSecond, new growth areas for cooperation will be cultivated. The two sides will declare the year 2020 as the Year of ASEAN-China Digital Economic Cooperation. It offers opportunities to expand cooperation in the emerging industries, such as the digital economy, e-commerce, smart cities and 5G. The two sides are exploring a blue economy partnership, with an aim to strengthening cooperation on marine environmental protection, scientific research, shipping and disaster relief. Cooperation in sustainable maritime development will also be a focus in the future.\nThird, the momentum of people-to-people exchanges will sustain. A strong ASEAN-China relationship boils down to closer people-to-people ties. The ASEAN-China Young Leaders Scholarship established months ago is a flagship project run by the two sides, with support from the newly established ASEAN-China Cooperation Fund Management Team in the ASEAN Secretariat.\nFourth, determination to maintain regional peace and stability will be cemented. This is the common aspiration and a shared responsibility of ASEAN and China. China and ASEAN countries are committed to the COC consultations and the formulation of regional maritime rules.\nFifth, commitment to uphold multilateralism will be strengthened. In a world of rising uncertainties, protectionism and unilateralism, regional hot-spot issues have brought unprecedented challenges to this region.\nChampioning multilateralism, openness, inclusiveness and win-win results is in the best interests of both ASEAN and China. Our two sides would make full use of the regional cooperation platforms to upgrade the free trade agreement protocol, conclude the RCEP negotiation as early as possible and facilitate free trade.\nToward an era of stronger cooperation, China is ready to work with ASEAN to develop an even-closer partnership of development, win-win results, innovation and mutual understanding and deliver more benefits to the peoples of both sides.\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nRelated Articles\nIndonesia should think twice about joining BRICS and OECD\nChina's Xi calls for more free trade\nBiden to meet Prabowo, Israeli president on Tuesday\nPresidential candidates set to spar on foreign, defense policies\nTop regional lender China struggling with development commitments, study finds\nRelated Article\nIndonesia should think twice about joining BRICS and OECD\nChina's Xi calls for more free trade\nBiden to meet Prabowo, Israeli president on Tuesday\nPresidential candidates set to spar on foreign, defense policies\nTop regional lender China struggling with development commitments, study finds\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nMore in Academia\nView more\nAcademia\nThe bottom-up wave of democratic rejuvenation\nAcademia\nPolice brutality: Fundamental problems in the institution\nAcademia\nFree trade deals increase Indonesian imports more than exports\nHighlight\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEditorial\nNarrow margin\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nThe Latest\nView more\nPolitics\nGovt to make KPK sole graft-fighting agency\nEconomy\nRI identifies 29 potential nuclear power plant sites\nEconomy\nChinese authorities are considering a weaker yuan as Trump trade risks loom, sources say\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia commences evacuation of 37 citizens in Damascus\nTech\nUS finalizes $6.1 billion Micron chip-making subsidy\nArchipelago\nTwo foreign visitors killed in tree collapse in Monkey Forest\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEconomy\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources"

(AFP/Jose Luis Magana)\nI\nn 1979, then United States secretary of state Cyrus Vance traveled to Indonesia to attend a meeting of ASEAN, which was formed just 12 years earlier. The historic meeting was the first of its kind, and it laid the foundation for the US-ASEAN Strategic Partnership that we enjoy today – a relationship central to the US approach to the region and our shared goals of peace and prosperity.\nBack then, few imagined the successes the coming decades would bring. Today, the US-ASEAN Strategic Partnership underscores our vitally important cooperation on everything from public health and human capital development to economic recovery and maritime security.\nAs we prepare for the US-ASEAN Summit and the East Asia Summit at the end of this month, it is important to remain focused on the tremendous strengths in the partnerships between the United States and countries in Southeast Asia.\nI am traveling in Southeast Asia this week to strengthen these partnerships across the board, and to work together with ASEAN nations to support a peaceful return to democracy in Myanmar. The international community must take bold action to address the deteriorating political, economic, and humanitarian crises in Myanmar and the threat they pose to regional stability.&nbsp;\nThe US applauds the principled stand of the ASEAN foreign ministers on Myanmar’s representation at the upcoming ASEAN summit, in light of the lack of progress by the military regime on the ASEAN five-point consensus. As the military regime continues its campaign of violent repression, the US will join with the international community to press the military regime to return Myanmar to its democratic path, allow for unimpeded humanitarian access, release unjustly detained individuals, cease all violence, and implement the five-point consensus that ASEAN — and the regime itself — agreed to in April. That includes immediately allowing the ASEAN special envoy, Brunei’s Foreign Minister Erywan Yusof, to visit Myanmar and meet with all stakeholders without conditions.\nBeyond addressing the crisis in Myanmar, America’s goals in the region are clear: we seek a region stable, prosperous, and at peace, where freedom—of the seas, of commerce, of each individual—and a commitment to the rules-based, ASEAN-led regional order ensure that power is subject to law and stability and prosperity prevail for generations to come.\nTo advance these objectives, the US will continue to deepen our alliances and partnerships in Southeast Asia and work closely with ASEAN and its members to address the most pressing challenges facing the region.\nFirst, we are committed to reflecting the centrality of ASEAN and Southeast Asia in our diplomacy. We know that ASEAN plays a critical role in ensuring regional stability, including in the maritime domain, as well as economic opportunity, people-to-people connectivity, and the rules-based international order – and we recognize the importance of elevated engagement with ASEAN.\nAlready this year, Secretary of State Antony Blinken has attended five ASEAN-led ministerial meetings, and Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm convened the first-ever US-ASEAN energy ministerial. The Vice President, secretary of defense, US ambassador to the UN, and deputy secretary of state have traveled to Southeast Asia to consult with partners on critically important challenges and opportunities.&nbsp; The US will continue to support the ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific, and US strategy will similarly continue to reflect Southeast Asia’s importance, and ASEAN’s critical role in determining the region’s future.\nThe US is further committed to reinforcing ASEAN centrality through innovative, results-oriented partnerships with allies and partners across the Indo-Pacific. Our five regional treaty alliances and this deep, growing network of bilateral and multilateral partnerships, including the Mekong-US Partnership, will help us advance our positive vision for the Indo-Pacific, for the collective benefit of all countries. The Quad, with its focus on climate, health, and technology, has demonstrated the benefits of such coordination – as just one example, the Quad vaccine initiative is enabling the production of one billion lifesaving COVID-19 vaccines.\nSecond, our top priority must be to stop the spread of COVID-19 by vaccinating as many people as possible in short order, while continuing to provide life-saving assistance for infected individuals. The US has made available more than US$200 million in assistance and 42 million vaccine doses in emergency health and humanitarian assistance to ASEAN member states to fight COVID-19. The US commends ASEAN’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic and we will continue to support ASEAN’s efforts to end this pandemic and prepare for the next.\nThird, our economic relations in Southeast Asia will remain critical. The flows of people, services, investment, and goods across the Indo-Pacific have connected our dynamic and growing markets for decades. Southeast Asian nations collectively represent the US’ fourth largest trading partner and support over 600,000 U. jobs. We must continue to deepen these connections.\nFourth, climate change has wreaked havoc in the region. Tackling this threat with seriousness and urgency represents an opportunity to build more resilient economies and create millions of jobs, while protecting our national security and preserving our collective environmental inheritance. The US will continue to partner with ASEAN countries, and we hope ASEAN members will enhance their respective commitments and announce ambitious climate targets in the lead up to the UN climate conference (COP26) in Glasgow in November.\nWhen Vice President Harris visited Singapore in August, she expressed her hope that, decades from now, we look back on this moment as “when our region joined together to realize a better future; when we took action to improve the lives of all people.”\nWhat we can accomplish through the deep partnerships between our countries will determine whether we turn that inspiring hope into an enduring reality. We are committed to doing just that.&nbsp;\n&nbsp;***\nThe writer is counselor of the United States Department of State.\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nRelated Articles\nHow Syria rebels' stars aligned for Assad's ouster\nVietnam's soaring US trade surplus stokes new fears of tariffs\nIndonesia has not surrendered sovereign rights in the North Natuna Sea\nASEAN, Canada work together for health security\nTrump at 201 electoral votes, Harris at 91: US media\nRelated Article\nHow Syria rebels' stars aligned for Assad's ouster\nVietnam's soaring US trade surplus stokes new fears of tariffs\nIndonesia has not surrendered sovereign rights in the North Natuna Sea\nASEAN, Canada work together for health security\nTrump at 201 electoral votes, Harris at 91: US media\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nMore in Academia\nView more\nAcademia\nThe bottom-up wave of democratic rejuvenation\nAcademia\nPolice brutality: Fundamental problems in the institution\nAcademia\nFree trade deals increase Indonesian imports more than exports\nHighlight\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEditorial\nNarrow margin\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nThe Latest\nView more\nPolitics\nGovt to make KPK sole graft-fighting agency\nEconomy\nRI identifies 29 potential nuclear power plant sites\nEconomy\nChinese authorities are considering a weaker yuan as Trump trade risks loom, sources say\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia commences evacuation of 37 citizens in Damascus\nTech\nUS finalizes $6.1 billion Micron chip-making subsidy\nArchipelago\nTwo foreign visitors killed in tree collapse in Monkey Forest\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEconomy\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources"

Further efforts to exploit much the same feebleness are the primary factor why passengers can no longer take any more than tiny amounts of liquid on board flights and, in some parts of the world, are required to have their footwear searched before being permitted to enter the plane.\n&nbsp;Essentially, passengers withstand these strictures with a weary compliance, conforming to it and recognizing it as much a part of contemporary aviation as jetlag ' the price of remaining safe.\nAnd when the news that MH370 had gone missing first appeared, a large number of regular passengers, including myself, would have expected the flight's progress to have been carefully tracked in order for the passengers to be accurately located. We would also have never doubted that no traveler would have got on board without having his or her identification verified and passport checked.\nAll this provides an explanation of why it was very disturbing to hear that little tracking was conducted, leaving the aviation investigation team to be dubious about whether the plane might have crashed in the South China Sea, the Gulf of Thailand, or even, as some predict, the Malacca Strait, creating a gigantic search area.\nThat response was aggravated by the recent stories that two of the travelers on board had Austrian and Italian passports that had been apparently stolen long before, but the validity of which were not verified during the routine check-in procedure in Kuala Lumpur.\nWhen all the questions surrounding MH370 are answered, many lessons need to be learnt to avoid repeating the same\nmistake.\nMuhammad Zulfikar Rakhmat\nDoha, Qatar\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nRelated Articles\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nFree trade deals increase Indonesian imports more than exports\nIndonesia’s tourist sector: A new era of innovation and growth\nPresident Prabowo should make Indonesia a global champion of democracy\nNew mosque in Nusantara to replace Istiqlal as state mosque\nRelated Article\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nFree trade deals increase Indonesian imports more than exports\nIndonesia’s tourist sector: A new era of innovation and growth\nPresident Prabowo should make Indonesia a global champion of democracy\nNew mosque in Nusantara to replace Istiqlal as state mosque\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nMore in News\nView more\nOpinion\nAnalysis: Govt adopts mandatory B35 biodiesel program as CPO prices tumble\nBusiness\nGlobal chip crunch stunts Indonesia car sales recovery\nBusiness\nXL profit falls in Q3 as tower sale income dries\nHighlight\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEditorial\nNarrow margin\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nThe Latest\nView more\nPolitics\nGovt to make KPK sole graft-fighting agency\nEconomy\nRI identifies 29 potential nuclear power plant sites\nEconomy\nChinese authorities are considering a weaker yuan as Trump trade risks loom, sources say\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia commences evacuation of 37 citizens in Damascus\nTech\nUS finalizes $6.1 billion Micron chip-making subsidy\nArchipelago\nTwo foreign visitors killed in tree collapse in Monkey Forest\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEconomy\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources"

Additionally, anemia among teenage girls aged 15-24 years has reached 15.5 percent. These issues pose significant challenges, impacting productivity and long-term health, making the preparation for a Golden Generation a national priority.\n&nbsp;\nIn support of meeting this challenge, Danone Indonesia continues the GESID (Generasi Sehat Indonesia) program in collaboration with AIESEC in Indonesia. This program focuses on empowering teenagers to prevent anemia and stunting through various educational activities. A key initiative of GESID involves ambassadors from various regions conducting peer-to-peer nutrition education. By 2024, the program has engaged over 6,000 ambassadors in 400 schools across cities such as Tangerang, Medan, Padang, Lampung, Bandung, Semarang, Sleman, Bantul, Surabaya and Sidoarjo.\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\nAs a form of appreciation for their commitment, dedication and contributions, GESID hosted the National Gathering 2024. This hybrid event, centered in Surakarta, involved ambassadors from 13 regions across Indonesia. Held at SMK 8 Surakarta, the event was attended by notable representatives including Nopian Andusti, deputy for family welfare and empowerment at the National Population and Family Planning Board (BKKBN) Central Java; Catur Budi Santosa, of the Elementary and Secondary Education Ministry and general directorate PAUD partner lead for the Sekolah Sehat; and Rizki Yusrini Pohan, health and nutrition senior manager at Danone Indonesia.\n&nbsp;\nNopian Andusti, deputy for family welfare and empowerment at the BKKBN, emphasized the critical impact of stunting on human resource quality, noting that it affects cognitive abilities and increases the risk of non-communicable disease.\n“Adolescence is a critical period in human development, including marriage, pregnancy and childbirth. Therefore, accelerating the reduction of stunting is a development priority. To tackle it, collaboration among parties is essential. Currently GESID supports four provinces which are among the 12 priorities by BKKBN”, said Nopian.\nParticipants also gained valuable insights from Ray Wagiu Basrowi, medical and science director at Danone Indonesia, who discussed anemia and mental health, as well as Dwi Hastuti, a lecturer in the department of family and consumer sciences at IPB University, Bogor, who presented on parenting patterns in school environments.\nEvery effort made by the ambassadors brings a positive influence and contributes to realizing Indonesia's Golden Generation in 2045. This event also served as a gathering, creating a platform for ambassadors to inspire one another and strengthen their commitment to nutrition and health education.\nThe event was further enlivened by various competitions designed to raise awareness about the importance of a healthy lifesty gole. In the speaker competition, the top two finalists, Grace Asima from Budi Murni 2 Senior High School in Medan, North Sumatra, and Ratu Farah from 4 Junior High School in Tangerang, Banten, were crowned winners and had the opportunity to present their materials at the national gathering.\nRizki Pohan, health and nutrition senior manager at Danone Indonesia, explained that “Danone Indonesia is committed to bringing health to as many people as possible through its products. This commitment applies globally, including in Indonesia. In line with the government’s focus on addressing anemia, which is closely related to stunting, we have the Danone Impact Journey. It consists of three pillars: Health, environment, and people/community, with the GESID program falling under the health category. We hope that GESID can contribute to the prevention of anemia and stunting from adolescence, and that the ambassadors will be prepared to become future leaders by 2045.”\nNiswatul, an ambassador from Sidoarjo regency, shared her experience, saying, \"There were many things I didn't know about teenage health.

The unprecedented show pinned enthusiastic audiences to their seats from beginning to end.\nThe performances on November 25, 26, and 28 showcased the students’ multiple talents as they delivered dialogue while singing and dancing, entertaining their audience of all ages.\nDuring one scene, the audience spontaneously stomped and clapped rhythmically while singing along to Queen’s iconic number from which the show takes its name. An image of one of Queen’s live performances in the 1970s, with a massive audience turnout, was visible on a large screen as the backdrop, effectively boosting the energy of the audience and creating an exciting and unifying atmosphere.\nThe audience also delightfully participated in singing “We Are the Champions”, reflecting a shared sense of fulfilment while following the story of “WWRY”, which expresses the victory of rebels led by a group known as the Bohemians whose aim is to revive the spirit of rock music.\nWhile everyone may have his/her interpretation of Queen’s lyrics to “WWRY”, the rhythm of the number is what drives the energy of the song, creating loud, exciting and powerful music.\nAt its core, the song is about triumph achieved through adversity, encouraging people to work hard and never give up hope when things get tough. During the BSJ performance, bright lights and fireworks were presented to celebrate victory, delighting and exciting the audience.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n“WWRY” and “We Are the Champions” were just two of the 23 Queen songs presented by BSJ students during the musical, with live music played by BSJ students from backstage.\nPlot-wise, “WWRY” is set in a dystopian future where individuality and live music are banned. It tells the story of how the all-powerful Global Soft Corporation, led by the ruthless Killer Queen, controls society, forcing its people to conform. However, a group of rebels called the Bohemians believe in the power of rock and roll and seek to revive real live music. They dream of a hero who will find the lost guitar of the legendary rock band Queen and bring back freedom and self-expression.\nEnter Galileo (played by Zane) and Scaramouche (played by Anissa), two unlikely rebels who feel out of place in this world of restriction and control. Together they embark on a journey to discover their identities and bring rock and roll back to life through Queen’s hits in a celebration of rebellion and a quest for freedom.\nAt one point, a 3D image of blowing fire which slowly engulfs Khashoggi (played by Finnley) and the Killer Queen (played by Amanda) was visible on the large screen, vividly depicting how the two figures who controlled the society and banned rock music eventually encountered death.\nCollaborations\nBSJ students’ collaboration with various parties was key to the success of their performance.\nAccording to BSJ, esteemed professionals Noel Sullivan, a former member of the chart-topping pop group Hear’Say, and James Bennett, celebrated for his choreography in “Strictly Come Dancing” and “Rocketman”, were involved in the production of “WWRY” as mentors.\nStudents said Noel brought valuable insights into vocal performance and stage presence, while Bennett empowered BSJ’s cast to explore and push boundaries in dance.\n“Working with Noel and James goes beyond mastering technical skills; it fosters a love for the performing arts, discipline and collaboration. Their mentorship nurtured resilience, confidence and adaptability, which are qualities that enhance students’ performance and equip them with skills for the future,” said Waltho, who helped produce the musical.\n“At its core, ‘WWRY’ celebrates individuality, resilience and the power of music, which are values that resonate deeply within our community. Over months of preparation, our students have grown as performers, young artists and team members, showcasing remarkable collaboration, discipline and self-expression,” she said.\n“Everything we do, we do for students. We want to give them the best life skills, not only related to academic accomplishment but also other practical skills for their future. We want to give them life experience. Someday, they may work in the United States or European countries. They get life experience here in Indonesia,” she said.\nMusic Director, Stephen Tomlinson expressed that great care is given to student’s potential development, which is why music, theatre, dance and other arts lessons are included in the BSJ curriculum.\n“What we do is to support students’ talent development. A musical is part of how students put arts theory into practice,” he said, adding that the school has musical concerts regularly.\nThe performance of “WWRY” involved more than 40 students aged 13 to 18.\nZane, Anissa, Amanda and Zack, four talented performers, acknowledged the demanding challenge of performing “WWRY” but said that their commitment, dedication and passion for the show enabled them to continue from start to finish.\n“I enjoyed the musical, ‘We Will Rock You’ because I have a passion for acting and singing,” said Zane, adding that studying acting at a university was one of his future possibilities.\nSharing how to keep energetic and enthusiastic during the show, Anissa said that it was like doing a math test: “In taking the test, you don’t want to stop until you finish. That’s what has kept me going,” she said.\nShe took her mom’s advice to maintain her voice quality before performing. “I chew\nkencur\n(aromatic ginger/galangal) and apple,” she said.\n“WWRY” director Jessica Yadav said she highly cherished ideas and input from all players.&nbsp;\nShe said that directing is about collaboration and that “everything you see in this production is a culmination of all of our ideas coming to life.”\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get ‘closer to the people’: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Article\nCollaboration paves the way for BSJ students’ success in performing ‘We Will Rock You’\nDeputy Minister Taufik: SSEAYP a symbol of youth solidarity and collaboration\nPhilanthropy a catalyst for the funds needed to tackle climate crisis\nCollaboration to sustain a favorable investment climate in Banten\nTukad Mati Lestari Badung and SRC collaborate to plant mangroves in Badung\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get ‘closer to the people’: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nMore in Culture\nView more\nHealth\nGESID National Gathering 2024 for the Zero Anemia Initiative\nArt &amp; Culture\nA Tribute to Giacomo Puccini: Celebrating 75 years of Italy-Indonesia relations\nEntertainment\nJay-Z accused in lawsuit of raping 13-year-old girl\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo’s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?\nAcademia\nStop with the LGBTQ scapegoating\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nAcademia\nNavigating Indonesia-US relations amid global and domestic changes"

(AFP/Luis Tata)\nI\nn today’s shifting geopolitical landscape, few multilateral alliances are as steadfast, or as essential, as the Group of 77 (G77). Since its founding in 1964, the bloc has expanded to include 134 countries from Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean, collectively representing 80 percent of the world’s population and two-thirds of the United Nations’ member states.\nBut the G77 has struggled to define its role in a rapidly changing world. This was evident at the group’s recent policy forum in New York, the United States, commemorating its 60th anniversary. I had the privilege of speaking at this event, hosted by its Ugandan chair, which highlighted the G77’s long-term challenges while showcasing its immense potential and growing global influence.\nFormed as a coalition of the world’s poorest countries, the G77 was conceived as a “weapon of the weak,” initially seeking to leverage its large membership to amplify the Global South’s voice in multilateral institutions. Yet, despite its size, the group has been unable to reshape the Westphalian state system and US-dominated postwar economic order, structures established long before many developing countries gained their independence.\nThe G77’s origins can be traced to the inaugural session of the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) in 1964. From the outset, the bloc has sought to challenge US-designed institutions like the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and its successor, the World Trade Organization, and promote a more equitable international order. At its first ministerial summit in October 1967, the group adopted the Algiers Charter, which called for sweeping reforms to address the hardships faced by developing countries in a global economic system heavily skewed in favor of the West.\nThe Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), established in 1961, emerged as a natural ally to the G77, with many overlapping members and shared objectives. Both groups drove transformative advances in international law, championing the principle of self-determination, especially in Palestine and Western Sahara, while affirming the legitimacy of decolonization and armed resistance in Algeria, Mozambique, South Africa and Vietnam. They denounced South Africa’s apartheid system as a “crime against humanity”.\nThese efforts were inspired by the 1960 Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, a landmark UN resolution that became a cornerstone of the decolonization movement. During this period, an unspoken Afro-Arab alliance emerged, as African countries supported the Palestinian struggle for statehood and Arab governments backed black South Africans in their fight against white settler rule.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nIn its quest to challenge Western-dominated systems, the G77 has also cultivated a unique and enduring alliance with China. This relationship, shaped by heated North-South debates in the UN General Assembly, deepened after the G77 played a pivotal role in Taiwan’s 1971 expulsion from the UN, clearing the way for the People’s Republic to take its seat. Although not formally part of the G77, China remains the only permanent member of the Security Council to be regularly invited to its meetings.\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get ‘closer to the people’: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nActivists call for accountability in a year filled with police brutality\nRelated Article\nStop with the LGBTQ scapegoating\nAgainst the tide: Defending human rights and civic freedoms in Southeast Asia\nAssad's fall in Syria exposes limits of China's Middle East diplomacy\nWith Assad gone, Middle East battle lines are redrawn\nPrabowo's maiden overseas trip indicative of RI's active global role\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get ‘closer to the people’: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nActivists call for accountability in a year filled with police brutality\nMore in Opinion\nView more\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo’s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?\nAcademia\nStop with the LGBTQ scapegoating\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nAcademia\nNavigating Indonesia-US relations amid global and domestic changes"

They were curious if Prabowo would reverse Indonesia’s long-standing position on China’s nine-dash line in the South China Sea, or if it was simply a show of negligence from our side.\nA veteran Indonesian diplomat asked, “Could this be interpreted as Indonesia recognizing China's nine-dash line and undermining its own sovereignty, or just going it alone?” He continued, “Joint development cooperation in the overlapping waters claimed by the two countries [makes it] seem like we are giving legitimacy to PRC maritime claims.”\nA senior journalist deems that the Foreign Ministry’s long-standing position on the South China Sea and Natuna waters must change in line with the vision of Prabowo, a former Army general.\n“Watch out for more changes in long time foreign policy positions under Prabowo. Diplomats and military see things differently,” he said in a WhatsApp group conversation.\nThe joint statement is called the “Joint Statement Between the People's Republic of China and the Republic of Indonesia on Advancing the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership and the China-Indonesia Community with a Shared Future”.\nOn point 9, the two leaders do not explicitly refer to the tensions between the two countries in the North Natuna waters. The 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) grants Indonesia the sovereign right to exploit resources in the waters as its exclusive economic zone (EEZ), but China claims that the area has been the fishing ground of its seafarers for thousands of years.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nAccording to the joint statement: “Both sides emphasized maritime cooperation as an important component of the comprehensive strategic cooperation between China and Indonesia.

(Reuters/Florence Lo)\nP\nresident\nPrabowo Subianto\n’s inaugural visit to China underscores a pivot toward great power diplomacy, a strategic approach that may mark a significant departure from Indonesia’s traditional stance more closely resembling what is now referred to and discussed as “middle power diplomacy.”\nOver the weekend, Prabowo met with key Chinese leaders, including Zhao Leji, chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Premier Li Qiang, and finally, President Xi Jinping. The visit yielded several notable agreements, such as a US$10 billion investment pledge between the countries and several memorandums of understanding related to water conservation, the blue economy and maritime resources, and mining.\nThe joint statement issued by the leaders, titled “Promoting Comprehensive Strategic Partnership and Building a China-Indonesia Community with a Shared Future”, reflects Prabowo’s strategic framing of China as an essential partner.\nFrom the various statements expressed by Prabowo, we can take a glimpse of how he stressed a multipolar world order, guided by principles like strategic autonomy, mutual trust, fairness and win-win cooperation.\nSuch a worldview indeed reflects the argument of the erosion of moral leadership by the very pole that has led the current global order, the United States, from unilateral protectionist policies, lack of appetite for all things multilateral, all the way to the moral quandary in the conflict in the Middle East.\nYet one aspect of this trip has raised concerns both domestically and internationally.

(Courtsey: iCIO Community)\nT\nhe iCIO Community, a network of information technology leaders in Indonesia, hosted its annual event, the iCIO Executive Leadership Forum, alongside the 2024 iCIO Awards. Held at the Thamrin Nine Ballroom, this event served as a key highlight in the iCIO Community's calendar, offering a platform for IT leaders and industry executives to engage in meaningful discussions.\nThis year's forum was themed \"Adapting to Uncertainty: Empowering Business Resilience in a Dynamic Era,\" which addressed the pressing challenges and uncertainties faced by businesses in today’s rapidly evolving landscape. IT leaders were invited to explore adaptive and innovative strategies that enhance their organizations’ resilience.\nThe event kicked off with a keynote session from Accenture senior managing director and Southeast Asia market unit lead Ng Wee Wei. Ng emphasized the critical role of resilience in the artificial intelligence-driven business environment, citing Accenture’s research on how resilience drives long-term revenue growth and profitability. She identified three key pillars for business resilience, a reinvention-ready digital core to enable agility, a workforce equipped with adaptive skills and resilient leadership capable of navigating challenges. According to Ng, in an era shaped by AI, these components are essential for sustaining growth and maintaining competitive advantage.\nJoining the conversation were Amazon Web Services (AWS) Indonesia country managing director Anthony Amni and Newgen business consulting vice president Ritesh Varma, who shared insights on data, cloud computing and AI implementation as critical enablers of business resilience.\nThe forum also featured a panel discussion with experts, including Boston Consulting Group principal Sugar Chan, Bank Mega information technology director YB Hariantono and Hewlett Packard Enterprise Indonesia managing director Meygin Agustina. Moderated by Coca-Cola Bottling Investment Group chief information officer Debbie Nova, the panel discussed strategies for cultivating a culture of resilience, addressing challenges like cybersecurity threats and regulatory changes and leveraging emerging technologies like AI to strengthen organizational resilience.\nIn addition to the discussions, the iCIO Awards were presented to recognize CIOs and CEOs who have successfully led digital transformation efforts within their organizations. These awards acknowledge individuals whose contributions have significantly supported growth and adaptation in an era of constant digital disruption.\nThrough this forum, the iCIO Community reinforced its commitment to fostering collaboration and sharing innovative solutions that strengthen Indonesia’s business resilience. “In a rapidly changing world, business resilience is not only about adaptation, but also about readiness to embrace the future through innovation and collaboration. The iCIO Community encourages cross-industry cooperation to exchange knowledge, harness new technologies and build a more resilient future,” said iCIO Community chairwoman Yessie Yosetya.\nThe iCIO Community is a community of CIOs and executives of companies and organizations in in the ICT sector in Indonesia designed as a platform for sharing practices and leadership in the ICT field.

(Antara/Bayu Pratama S.)\nT\nhe relentless pace of technological advancement is nothing short of breathtaking. Quantum computers, soon to compute 47 years faster than today’s supercomputers, are nearly a reality.\nChatGPT, once a novelty, has seamlessly integrated into daily life. Drones now traverse the skies, delivering food, medicine and disaster relief to the most remote corners of the globe. Satellites illuminate Himalayan villages with internet connectivity.\nMeanwhile, digital technologies have given rise to breakthroughs in biotechnology, robotics, nanotechnology, environmental science and medical research, heralding transformative solutions for humanity and our planet. Indeed, the sky is no longer the limit.\nYet, amid these marvels, a stark reality casts a shadow. The United Nations, striving to achieve the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030, finds itself lamentably behind schedule. Despite our technological strides, progress remains frustratingly sluggish, particularly in the Asia-Pacific, where climate action is alarmingly retrogressing.\nDigital technologies offer a lifeline. They hold the promise of being transformative in achieving the SDGs, especially for women entrepreneurs and youth, fostering inclusivity. However, to unlock this immense potential, we must first ensure robust connectivity, cultivate requisite skills, enact appropriate legislation and secure financing.\nConnectivity is key and critical to inclusive and sustainable development, especially among least developing countries, landlocked developing countries and small island developing states.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nPersistent power shortages and unstable grids, especially in rural areas, hinder necessary infrastructure.\nIn 2023, 33 percent of the global population remained offline, with 73 percent of these individuals in low-income countries, according to ITU statistics.\nThe high cost of digital devices further widens this gap. Equally critical is the development of digital skills. Large parts of the population in developing nations, particularly in the least developed countries of the Asia-Pacific, lack the skills to engage with the digital economy. This deficit is exacerbated by poor-quality education, especially in rural areas.\nAn effective legal and regulatory environment is indispensable. Many Asia-Pacific countries lack overarching e-commerce regulations, leaving significant gaps in areas such as online contracts, e-signatures, consumer protection, cybersecurity, taxation and data privacy.\nOnly 37 percent of small island developing states and 48 percent of least developed countries have enacted data protection laws. Financing is another critical factor.\nAccess to capital, especially for women and youth entrepreneurs, is vital for digital sector growth. Around 40 percent of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in developing countries face a US$5 trillion financing gap, with women-owned businesses receiving just 3 percent of venture capital funding.\nThe international community's role in galvanizing digital transformation in the Asia-Pacific is pivotal. While initiatives like Aid for Trade have seen an uptick in information and communication technology-related commitments, rising from $1.5 billion in 2019 to $2.2 billion in 2021, these investments account for a mere 4.1 percent of total allocations. There is a pressing demand for substantially increased financial backing.\nEffective reform hinges on collaboration among national governments, the private sector and other stakeholders, as well as development partners. Digital technologies are pivotal in addressing SDG challenges in the Asia-Pacific.\nIn India, drones delivering medical supplies to remote areas drastically improve health outcomes by ensuring timely access to essential medicines and vaccines. In the Philippines, telemedicine bridges healthcare gaps, connecting underserved patients with professionals.\nSatellite technology in Indonesia revolutionizes education by bringing internet access to rural communities, enabling virtual classrooms and remote learning, equipping youth with essential skills.\nMoreover, digital platforms can spur economic growth by fostering digital entrepreneurship and e-commerce, empowering small businesses, particularly those owned by women and youth, to expand their reach and stimulate economic development. Biotechnology innovations strengthen food security by developing resilient crops, while precision agriculture boosts yield and reduces waste. Environmental monitoring provides critical data, helping governments track deforestation, monitor pollution and predict natural disasters.\nAdditionally, digital payment systems and mobile banking enhance financial inclusion, offering underserved populations access to essential financial services. This empowers individuals, especially women, to save, invest and build businesses, contributing to poverty reduction and economic stability.\nWe stand amid a digital revolution, where the urgency for decisive, unified action has never been greater. To tackle the formidable challenges ahead, we must leverage our collective knowledge, skills and expertise.\nThe international community must rise to the occasion, ensuring that no one is left behind. By prioritizing connectivity, skill development, robust legislation and sustainable financing, we can unlock the transformative potential of digital technologies. Though our future may be precarious, it holds the promise of a more inclusive and sustainable world—if we unite in a global endeavour to embrace this digital metamorphosis.\nThe time for rhetoric has passed; now, we must escalate our global commitment to ensure the dividends of digital progress are shared by all, leaving no region or community in the shadows. The moment to act is now, to ensure the benefits of this digital era reach everyone, everywhere.\n***\nAtsuko Okuda is director of International Telecommunication Union (ITU) regional office for Asia and the Pacific.

(Courtesy of Communi &amp; Co)\nT\nhe Investment Ministry/Investment Coordinating Board (BKPM) has urged the Banten provincial government to maintain a conducive and healthy investment climate, ensuring investors feel comfortable and do not withdraw. This follows complaints from investors about frequent requests for donations or other contributions from certain groups.\nBKPM deputy for investment promotion Nurul Ichwan highlighted that investor discomfort could negatively impact the business environment, potentially leading to rising unemployment. He noted that the presence of companies drives job creation and employment opportunities, including for local communities.\n\"Once again, I emphasize that the local community must understand that business is business. Therefore, please foster empathy toward those who work there so that they, and their families in need of food and education, can benefit from the investment,\" Ichwan told the Banten Investment Forum 2024, held at the JHL Solitaire Hotel in Gading Serpong, Tangerang, on Oct. 29.\nIchwan emphasized the importance of collective responsibility in protecting the investment climate. Without a shared commitment, the province's economic conditions could deteriorate. \"We must prevent any harm to the favorable investment climate. If investors feel disturbed, they may choose to leave Banten, undermining employment efforts,\" he cautioned.\nMeanwhile, Virgojanti, head of the Banten Provincial Investment and Integrated Services Agency (DPMPTSP), called on Banten residents to be more open to investment. She stressed that if all stakeholders work together, Banten could become a prime investment destination, greatly benefiting the local economy and communities.\nVirgojanti added that the Banten government would maintain good communication with the business sector to ensure a healthy investment environment. \"If issues arise, we will facilitate solutions for investors and encourage businesses to engage with local communities, ensuring they share the benefits of investment,\" she said.\nThe Banten Investment Forum 2024 aimed to bring together business players, prospective investors, financial institutions, local government and the community, welcoming input from economic stakeholders on investment opportunities and recommendations to enhance Banten’s investment services.\nThe event spotlighted discussions on investment opportunities, upcoming economic challenges and green economy initiatives.

Virgojanti reiterated, \"Investment realization is only achievable through collaboration.\"\nThe forum also featured memorandums of understanding between large corporations and several MSMEs in Banten, along with the introduction of the investment brand “Banten Gold.” Virgojanti explained that Banten Gold represents Banten’s vast, yet under-recognized, investment potential.\nThe event concluded with the issuance of business registration numbers (NIB) to MSMEs and in-depth discussions for investors on opportunities in Banten’s investment landscape, including the Tanjung Lesung Special Economic Zone (SEZ), the PIK 2 National Strategic Project and the BSD City Integrated SEZ. “Investment potential in Banten remains substantial.

(Antara/Vice Presidential Secretariat )\nA\nt the time of writing, the Middle East is ablaze with conflict, threatening to spiral into a full-scale regional war. This crisis, compounded by the ongoing devastation of the Russia-Ukraine war and the escalating strategic competition between the United States and China, is sending shockwaves through global supply chains, destabilizing energy markets and intensifying protectionist tendencies.\nIn this fraught landscape, the world also faces the combined challenges of slowing economic growth, financial turbulence, as well as climate disasters and health crises. These converging forces have raised urgent concerns about long-term economic resilience for the global economy. In such precarious times, the need for collaborative action to safeguard stability and strengthen the ability to withstand and rebound from economic disruptions has never been more critical.\nWith its strategic location, abundant natural resources, and a dynamic, youthful workforce, Indonesia is uniquely poised to drive ASEAN’s future growth and enhance the region’s economic resilience.\nAs the largest economy in the region, Indonesia has been playing a pivotal role in shaping ASEAN’s economic agenda with a consistent track record. It has led major regional initiatives that have shaped the trajectory of economic cooperation in Southeast Asia. For example, Indonesia was instrumental in developing the 2003 Bali Concord II, which laid the groundwork for the eventual establishment of the ASEAN Economic Community.\nThroughout its chairmanship last year, Indonesia championed priorities that echoed its own national agenda, spearheading post-pandemic recovery through digital transformation and sustainable development. These efforts, including a strong focus on digitization and emerging industries like electric vehicles, reflect Indonesia's commitment to forging a resilient, future-ready economy for the country and the broader ASEAN Community.\nImportant milestones during Indonesia’s 2023 chairmanship include, among others, the convening of the ASEAN Indo-Pacific Forum and the launch of negotiations on the Digital Economy Framework Agreement (DEFA). Once finalized, DEFA will become the world’s first regional digital economy agreement.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nIndonesia is also actively seeking to reduce barriers to prosperity within its society, understanding that resilience must be cultivated from the ground up. Through targeted social programs, support for micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs), digital inclusion, and infrastructure development that connects remote areas to economic hubs, Indonesia is strengthening local economies and addressing internal disparities.\nThis focus on inclusive growth has also shaped Indonesia’s economic leadership within ASEAN. Through the ASEAN Comprehensive Recovery Framework, Indonesia emphasized the critical role of supporting MSMEs to drive economic vitality and reduce inequalities, creating a foundation for equitable growth and shared prosperity, which is the prerequisite for long-term resilience.\nGiven the profound integration of our economies within global supply chains and the critical role of international trade in driving our economic growth, advancing an open trade agenda through a robust network of ASEAN free trade agreements with key partners is essential. Indonesia has played a pivotal role in these initiatives, notably the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), the world’s largest free trade agreement, which came into effect in 2022.\nIndonesia’s active role will continue to be crucial in ensuring that ASEAN remains a key player in the global supply chains.\nThis proactive approach aligns seamlessly with Lao PDR’s ASEAN chairmanship this year, which features the theme “Enhancing Connectivity and Resilience”. The recent ASEAN Summit in Vientiane reaffirmed ASEAN’s resolve to strengthen its collective resilience and regional integration to withstand and address emerging global challenges, from geoeconomic geopolitical tensions to the increasing fragmentation of the global economy.\nAs the world’s fifth-largest economy and third-largest global trading power, ASEAN must enhance its ability to navigate an increasingly fragmented global order, especially given its reliance on open economic regionalism. Deepening intra-ASEAN economic integration while strengthening external economic relations will be essential for ensuring resilience in the face of global challenges. Furthermore, ASEAN must prioritize several strategic initiatives and priorities that reinforce resilience while promoting sustainable and inclusive growth throughout the region.\nFirst, strengthening intra-ASEAN trade and investment is essential. While trade with major economies like the US, China and the European Union remains vital, ASEAN's resilience hinges on boosting intra-regional trade, capitalizing on the region's promising growth prospects.\nIn 2023, intra-ASEAN trade reached US$758.9 billion, accounting for 21 percent of total trade, a significant contribution given that ASEAN's total trade of $3.5 trillion is nearly on par with its GDP of $3.8 trillion.\nTo accelerate growth, ASEAN must focus on reducing non-tariff barriers, harmonizing standards and enhancing digital trade and customs processes. The ongoing upgrade of the ASEAN Trade in Goods Agreement (ATIGA) addresses both traditional trade issues and emerging challenges such as supply chain connectivity and food security. This initiative also explores innovative dispute resolution mechanisms and integrates circular economy principles, reinforcing ASEAN’s role in sustainable global supply chains.\nIntra-ASEAN investment, valued at $21.8 billion (9.5 percent of ASEAN’s total in 2023), also presents significant growth potential. The signing of the Fifth Protocol of the ASEAN Comprehensive Investment Agreement (ACIA) this year marks a critical step in modernizing ASEAN’s investment framework.\nIt is essential to enhance the business environment by promoting regulatory transparency, advancing infrastructure development and ensuring seamless mobility of goods, services and people across the region. These initiatives will not only foster a more attractive investment climate but also strengthen the overall economic integration within ASEAN, paving the way for sustainable growth and resilience.\nSecond, ASEAN must maintain open regionalism and diversify its supply chains. As multinational corporations increasingly seek to reduce dependency on single countries or regions, ASEAN is strategically positioned to seize this opportunity, thanks to its extensive network of free trade agreements with major global economies.\nWith Indonesia’s leadership, ASEAN is implementing the RCEP, upgrading free trade agreements with major economies like China and India, and negotiating a new agreement with Canada, while continuously exploring new markets with vast growth potential.\nThird, embracing the digital and sustainable economy is crucial. Driven by rapid technological adoption, e-commerce and digital finance, ASEAN’s digital economy is projected to be worth $1 trillion by 2030, with the potential to double through ambitious negotiations on the DEFA.\nBeyond digitalization, sustainability and environmental resilience have become central to global economic discussions, especially in the face of climate change. Under Indonesia’s chairmanship last year, ASEAN adopted the ASEAN Strategy for Carbon Neutrality and the ASEAN Blue Economy Framework, reinforcing commitments to decarbonization and sustainable growth at both the regional and national levels.\nLastly, ASEAN must preserve its centrality and engage constructively with all major powers. Amid rising geopolitical tensions, maintaining ASEAN's centrality by strengthening regional institutions and promoting multilateralism is essential. Constructive engagement with major powers, while avoiding entanglement in rivalries, will be crucial for ASEAN’s future.\nLooking ahead, under the leadership of President\nPrabowo Subianto\n, we look forward to Indonesia’s continued proactive role in navigating ASEAN through the complexities of a fragmented global economy. By leveraging Indonesia’s economic strengths and strategic position, ASEAN will be well positioned to secure its prosperity in the post-2025 landscape and chart a bold path toward the ASEAN Vision 2045, aligning seamlessly with the Golden Indonesia 2045 vision.\nForging a more integrated and resilient ASEAN, where national and regional strength reinforce each other in a virtuous circle, is the best way forward in our collective pursuit of resilience, innovation and shared prosperity.\n***\nThe writer is secretary-general of ASEAN.\n&nbsp;\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get ‘closer to the people’: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nActivists call for accountability in a year filled with police brutality\nRelated Article\nIs Southeast Asia the next frontier for AI?\nTaiwan's Lai kicks off Marshall Islands visit as China fumes\nPhilippine president says Russian submarine in South China Sea 'worrisome'\nASEAN in the global economy: A half-century journey\nLeveraging technologies for youth and female entrepreneurship\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get ‘closer to the people’: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nActivists call for accountability in a year filled with police brutality\nMore in Opinion\nView more\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo’s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?\nAcademia\nStop with the LGBTQ scapegoating\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nAcademia\nNavigating Indonesia-US relations amid global and domestic changes"

This cannot be separated from the policies and programs designed by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Research, and Technology, which aim to ensure fairness, equity, and improved access to comprehensive education. The positive impacts of these policies have been felt not only by students but also by educators, education personnel, and the wider community.&nbsp;\nVivi Andriani, Head of the Planning Bureau at the Ministry of Education, Culture, Research, and Technology, emphasized the importance of efforts to enhance fairness, equity, and expand access to education. She stated that several policies have been implemented by the ministry, including educational assistance programs such as the Indonesia Smart Program and Affirmation of Secondary and Higher Education.&nbsp;\n“There are still many children who do not have adequate access to education, and some have not attended school at all. Therefore, these policies must be ensured to work,” said Vivi during the *Merdeka Belajar* (Freedom to Learn) webinar broadcast on the Ministry of Education, Culture, Research, and Technology’s YouTube channel on Thursday (October 17).&nbsp;\nShe added that over the last five years, the Ministry of Education, Culture, Research, and Technology has implemented several key policies through the *Merdeka Belajar* program. These efforts aim to ensure that learning in schools is more student-centered and aligned with the potential and capacity of each educational institution. This is also supported by balanced funding, such as the distribution of Educational Operational Assistance (BOS) funds, allocated differently based on region and the needs of each educational institution, such as for special education schools (SLB) and vocational schools (SMK).&nbsp;\nVivi explained that, aside from improving student learning outcomes, the *Merdeka Belajar* program has also had a positive impact on education as a whole. Teachers are now encouraged to continuously learn and develop themselves through training available on the *Merdeka Mengajar* (Freedom to Teach) Platform (PMM). “Educational transformation is not only aimed at students but also at teaching staff. Teachers are now more prepared and competent to teach using more effective methods,” she said.&nbsp;\nIn the same seminar, Fitriana, the National Coordinator of the *Kami Pengajar* (We Educators) Community, shared her perspective as a teacher on the impact of *Merdeka Belajar*. According to her, the program has spurred transformation in various areas, including educational technology, policy, leadership, and curriculum.&nbsp;\n“Merdeka Belajar has motivated teachers to continue learning. In addition to enhancing teachers' competencies, the program also improves educational facilities and ensures that teachers work in safe and comfortable environments,” Fitriana said.&nbsp;\nSusi Sukaesih, Chair of the *Sidina/Ibu Penggerak* (Sidina/Mother Movers) Community, stated that more than 200 facilitators are ready to help socialize *Merdeka Belajar* from the perspective of parents.&nbsp;\n“We help with socialization. Our audience consists of parents and students, with the most requested topic from students being awareness about bullying,” she said.&nbsp;\nSusi mentioned that parents are very pleased with the *Merdeka Belajar* program because it is highly relevant and in line with current developments. She also encouraged her peers to create the *Ibu Penggerak* movement.&nbsp;\n“I started this in 2022 and organized online training sessions on updates to *Merdeka Belajar* programs, such as the *Merdeka Curriculum*, the *Pancasila Student Profile*, and the *Prevention and Handling of Violence in Educational Institutions* (PPKSP),” she explained.&nbsp;\nSome of the *Merdeka Belajar* programs she appreciates include the policy for a smooth transition from early childhood education (PAUD) to elementary school (SD), the PPKSP program that provides a safe space for students, teachers, and principals, the *Indonesian Book Information System* (SIBI), and the *Merdeka Curriculum*.&nbsp;\n“With the *Merdeka Curriculum*, students now engage more in project-based learning, challenging them to be creative,” Susi added.&nbsp;\nMeanwhile, Almendo Imanuel, a student beneficiary of the *Merdeka Belajar Kampus Merdeka* (MBKM) program, praised the *Kampus Merdeka* program for having a tremendous and positive impact on him.&nbsp;\n“The program I participated in, *Merdeka Student Exchange*, has had a significant impact on me, bringing about many changes and improvements, such as fostering enthusiasm, self-confidence, and the ability to compete,” he said.&nbsp;\nAlmendo is a Physics Education student from the Faculty of Teacher Training and Education at Musamus University, Merauke. He participated in the *Merdeka Student Exchange* (PMM) Batch 4 and achieved the accolade of Best *PMM Inbound UI Tribal Leader* for Batch 4.&nbsp;\nThe government remains committed to continuing and developing existing educational policies to ensure the achievement of Indonesia’s 2045 Golden Vision. In this context, national educational development over the past ten years has been a significant milestone in the effort to create a generation that is not only academically smart but also prepared to face evolving global demands.&nbsp;&nbsp;\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get ‘closer to the people’: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Article\nNatural disasters damage 58 Cianjur schools\nAPRIL Group improves children’s health, education access in Riau for Human Rights Day\nGovt develops mechanism to help teachers obtain associate, bachelor's degrees\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nTime to regulate\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get ‘closer to the people’: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nMore in Front row\nView more\nFront Row\nThink Business, Think Hong Kong: Spotlighting Asia opportunities in Jakarta\nFront Row\nBPJS Kesehatan partners with stakeholders to build a fraud-free JKN ecosystem\nFront Row\nFore Coffee ends the year strong with hopeful prospects and locally focused products\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo’s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?\nAcademia\nStop with the LGBTQ scapegoating\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nAcademia\nNavigating Indonesia-US relations amid global and domestic changes"

Both of our regions are prone to earthquakes, floods and the consequences of climate change, increasingly so.\nEarly in September, I was shocked by the reports of the devastation caused by Typhoon Yagi across Southeast Asia. One of the strongest cyclones in the region in decades, Yagi left a deadly trail of destruction across Vietnam, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand and Cambodia.\nThe European Union, as a leading global humanitarian donor, stepped in to help. We released over 2 million euros (US$2.18 million) in emergency funding to support the victims.\nWhile people in Southeast Asia were coping with the impact of Yagi, more than 8,000 kilometers away, storm Boris was lashing central and eastern Europe. Nearly a dozen European countries were affected by floods.\nSuch extreme weather events that used to appear once in a lifetime are now happening almost annually. The global reality of climate breakdown is not sparing anyone. And make no mistake, these tragedies are not anomalies. They are fast becoming the norm for our shared future on this planet.&nbsp;\nThis is why disaster preparedness is a constant strand of the EU’s humanitarian funding across the world. In ASEAN countries, the EU has been supporting disaster preparedness efforts for nearly 20 years. Since 2020, we have invested nearly 87 million euros of EU funds for this purpose in Asia.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nThe EU also responds regularly to emergencies in the region, immediately once they occur, both through our humanitarian aid and civil protection tools. Such was the case 20 years ago, when a tsunami of unprecedented scale wreaked havoc across Southeast Asia, with northern Aceh bearing the brunt of the disaster. Then, European solidarity stepped in to help.\nThe EU, together with several of its members, was the largest contributor to the fund set up in the aftermath of the tragedy, to support the rehabilitation and reconstruction of the affected communities.\nThanks to this initiative, more than 20,000 homes were rebuilt, together with 670 schools, and hundreds of kilometers of roads and irrigation channels, among other key infrastructure. It represented a landmark for the partnership between the EU and Indonesia.\nWith the memory of that tragic moment still very present in our minds, the EU remains committed to supporting ASEAN countries to face the existing humanitarian crisis nowadays. For this purpose, I am happy to announce a new 21.5 million euro aid package to be used in Bangladesh, Myanmar, Malaysia and Indonesia.\nI am proud to be in Jakarta to endorse the new agreement with ASEAN’s Coordinating Centre for Humanitarian Assistance on Disaster Management (AHA).\nThis new agreement reached between the EU and the AHA center will allow us to strengthen our respective capacities to respond to disasters and to exchange expertise and good practices. As ASEAN’s countries have long experience to share in disaster response, I am convinced this will provide a great opportunity to learn from each other.\n***\nThe writer is EU commissioner for crisis management.

Themed “Adapting to Uncertainty: Empowering Business Resilience in a Dynamic Era”, the event featured parallel sessions on optimizing IT strategies and advancing cybersecurity innovations. (Courtesy of iCIO Community)\nT\nhe iCIO Community held a focus group discussion (FGD) with Indonesian IT leaders to discuss efforts to confront business uncertainty and cyber threats. The FGD is part of the iCIO Executive Leadership Forum and the iCIO Awards 2024 series, culminating on Nov. 6, 2024.\nWith the main theme of “Adapting to Uncertainty: Empowering Business Resilience in a Dynamic Era”, this series aims to provide in-depth insights and practical solutions for IT leaders in navigating business uncertainties in this dynamic era.\nThe FGD was conducted in two parallel sessions, each focusing on subtopics relevant to the challenges as well as the opportunities in the current world of information technology and cybersecurity. The first session explored the importance of optimizing IT strategies to navigate ever-changing business dynamics. The second session concentrated on the latest cybersecurity innovations, current challenges and the future direction of security measures.\nFirst session: Effective IT strategies to face business uncertainties\n&nbsp;\nIn the first session, the discussion delved deeper into how companies can align their IT strategies with constantly evolving business goals. Amid slowing economic growth and tight IT budgets, IT leaders shared their experiences in prioritizing projects based on impact as the best strategy to balance innovation, security and cost-efficiency. They also discussed leveraging cost-effective technologies such as cloud computing and automation, along with strengthening strategic partnerships and outsourcing.\nA key highlight of the session was a presentation from McKinsey, where their global survey revealed that over 90 percent of chief information officers (CIOs) were currently undergoing transformation by adopting technologies such as cloud storage, artificial intelligence and the internet of things (IoT). These technologies have become critical pillars to enhance companies’ productivity and efficiency.\nInterestingly, the survey also found that 58 percent of top-performing companies preferred developing internal talent over outsourcing, marking a significant shift in how organizations address their technology needs.\n“By building technological capabilities within the organization, they create more sustainable competitive advantage compared to relying on outsourcing,” said McKinsey &amp; Company associate partner Vivek Jha.\nDespite significant investments, 70 percent of IT transformations still fall short of expectations because of several factors, including limited funding and management bandwidth, partial implementation of transformations and failure to create a&nbsp;meaningful impact or deliver changes too late to make a difference.\nTo address these challenges, CIOs must ensure that transformations are guided by a clear vision and aligned with strategic business goals. It is crucial for CIOs to connect technology with business objectives considering the independencies between technology and operations, as well as build strong transformation capabilities within their organization.\nSecond session: Cybersecurity investment to tackle digital threats\nThe second session, meanwhile, focused on the critical need to build cybersecurity resilience in the face of rising global digital threats. It highlighted that increasing cyber-attacks, especially those targeting cloud technology, pose significant risks to organizations. Many still need to enhance their preparedness for these threats.\nKey challenges include budget constraints, limited resources, technological complexities and insufficient management support. As cyber threats evolve, organizations must continually strengthen their defenses to counter increasingly sophisticated attacks.\nPwC Indonesia risk assurance director Andrew Tirtadjaja presented findings from the\n2024 Digital Trust Insights – Asia Pacific\nreport, revealing that 51 percent of respondents viewed cloud-related attacks as their greatest concern. Additionally, over 40 percent of companies experienced data breaches resulting in losses exceeding $1 million in 2024, an increase from 31 percent the previous year.\nIndonesia has introduced several regulations to enhance cybersecurity, such as Presidential Regulation No. 82/2022 on critical information infrastructure protection, and Law No. 27/2022 on personal data protection. These initiatives underscore the government’s commitment to tackling complex cyber threats and safeguarding personal data.\nHowever, these regulations also challenge organizations to innovate continuously in their cybersecurity strategies. According to the PwC survey, the top three concerns for C-level executives are cloud-related attacks, attacks on connected devices (IoT), as well as hack and lead operations\nAs organizations shift from on-premises systems to the cloud, they become appealing targets for hackers, often underestimating their responsibility for security. Common pitfalls include inadequate access controls, neglecting the principle of least privilege, and inconsistent security standards.\n“Close collaboration between industry and regulators is key to minimizing digital risks in the future,” Andrew Tirtadjaja stated.\nThese topics of strategies to face business uncertainty and cyberattacks will be further explored at the iCIO Executive Leadership Forum and iCIO Awards 2024, where IT leaders will gain strategic insights through keynote presentations and panel discussions centered on “Adapting to Uncertainty: Empowering Business Resilience in a Dynamic Era”.\nThe iCIO Community is a network of chief information officers (ICOs) and executives in the ICT sector from companies and organizations in Indonesia, designed as a platform for sharing best practices and leadership in ICT.

(Antara/Bayu Pratama S)\nF\nrom the bustling urban centers of Jakarta and Surabaya to the lush rainforests of Sumatra, Indonesia has been deeply shaped by its geography and natural resources. Yet today, your country faces an existential crisis that demands immediate, collective action. Climate change is no longer a distant threat for Indonesia; it is a lived reality, with its impact growing more severe each year.\nAs Indonesia prepares to join the world stage at COP29 in Baku, it stands at a critical juncture. With a vast, vulnerable coastline, high population density and dependence on natural resources, Indonesia is particularly susceptible to climate change. Rising sea levels threaten low-lying coastal areas, while shifting rainfall patterns and increasing temperatures have disrupted agriculture and livelihoods.\nThis challenge is not Indonesia's alone. Many of the world’s most climate-vulnerable nations, including small island developing states (SIDS) and countries across the Global South, despite contributing the least to global warming, share similar struggles.\nWith Azerbaijan hosting COP29, I encourage Indonesia to use this year’s conference as a platform to advocate for your interests and strengthen your role in global climate action. As president-designate of COP29, I invite you to amplify the voices of your people and businesses, highlighting the shared need for a just transition that reflects the concerns of other developing nations.\nCOP29 is not just another international summit; it is a pivotal moment for Indonesia to play a role in shaping both regional and global climate policies. At the heart of our COP29 agenda is a commitment to elevating the voices of nations on the frontlines of climate change.\nWe understand your challenges. In Azerbaijan, like Indonesia, we face our own climate crises, from droughts and rising temperatures to the shrinking Caspian Sea. We recognize that the time to act is now, and that our vulnerability to climate change must be addressed without further delay.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nIndonesia’s vulnerability is undeniable. Extreme weather events, such as shifting rainfall patterns, are already affecting agriculture and food security for millions. Rising sea levels and coastal erosion threaten communities in low-lying areas, while cities like Jakarta, which is already sinking, face growing risks from more frequent and severe flooding. This is not just a future crisis; it is happening now.\nHowever, Indonesia is also home to vast tropical forests, particularly in Sumatra and Kalimantan, which serve as critical carbon sinks. Moreover, your country holds great potential for geothermal energy, providing a pathway to cleaner, sustainable development.\nYour rich biodiversity and economic promise offer opportunities to both mitigate climate change and build resilience. The world needs Indonesia to succeed in this green transition, and Indonesia needs global support to achieve it.\nA key focus of COP29 is amplifying the voices of vulnerable nations. While Indonesia is not a small island state, it shares common ground with many developing nations in the Global South. Climate change crosses borders but its impact is felt unevenly, with the developing world bearing the greatest burden.\nAt COP29, Azerbaijan will advocate for increased adaptation and mitigation finance, particularly for nations like Indonesia, which require support not only to reduce emissions but also to protect communities from climate impacts. The New Collective Quantified Goal (NCQG) for climate finance will be central to the discussions. This mechanism aims to mobilize greater financial resources to support developing nations like Indonesia in their adaptation and mitigation efforts.\nOne of COP29's key priorities will be implementing Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, which enables countries to collaborate on meeting their emission reduction targets. For Indonesia, this is an opportunity to leverage international carbon markets and secure funding to accelerate the shift to renewable energy, such as solar and wind.\nAt COP29, Indonesia has an opportunity to demonstrate leadership, not just as a country vulnerable to climate change, but as a nation committed to finding solutions.\nAs you are on track to become one of the world’s largest economies, your country is already making long-term investments in green technologies.\nYour potential in renewable energy is vast. The floating solar power plant in Purwakarta, West Java, the largest in Southeast Asia, exemplifies your country’s commitment to clean energy. Expanding such initiatives will not only enhance renewable capacity, but also attract investment in sustainable technologies.\nIndonesia’s manufacturing sector, a key driver of GDP, could also be central to this transition. The private sector stands to benefit from increasing global demand for clean energy and sustainably produced goods. Investments in renewable energy, sustainable infrastructure and climate-resilient supply chains would not only strengthen Indonesia’s long-term economic stability, but also contribute meaningfully to global climate objectives.\nAs the world convenes in Baku this November, Indonesia will be a key participant in the global climate dialogue. COP29 offers a platform not only to secure climate finance and negotiate emissions targets, but to demonstrate that developing nations are critical players in the fight against climate change.\nBy taking proactive steps, elevating the voices of its most vulnerable communities and leveraging its resources for sustainable development, Indonesia has the potential to help shape a future where all countries, regardless of size or wealth, have an equal voice at the table.\nAs COP29 approaches, I invite Indonesia’s government, business leaders and civil society to join us in Baku. Together, we can turn ambition into action and build a more resilient, sustainable future for Indonesia and the world.\n***\nThe writer is the COP29 president-designate and Azerbaijan’s minister of ecology and natural resources.\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get ‘closer to the people’: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nActivists call for accountability in a year filled with police brutality\nRelated Article\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nGlobal wine output to hit lowest level since 1961\nBusiness seeks details in face of mixed COP29 climate messages\nWhy corruption could derail Indonesia’s climate fight\nTalks on halting nature loss enter extra time in Colombia\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get ‘closer to the people’: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nActivists call for accountability in a year filled with police brutality\nMore in Opinion\nView more\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo’s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?\nAcademia\nStop with the LGBTQ scapegoating\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nAcademia\nNavigating Indonesia-US relations amid global and domestic changes"

(AFP/Pool/Jiji Press)\nA\nt the farewell Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad) summit hosted by United States President Joe Biden in Wilmington, Delaware, the Quad showed clear signs of consolidation. For Biden, it was a fitting tribute, because it was under his presidency that the Quad raised itself to a summit.\nNow it has met for the sixth time, twice virtually. Quad foreign ministers have met eight times over the last five years, and Quad commerce and industry ministers and development finance institutions are scheduled to start regular meetings too.\nThe most prominent message from the Quad summit, thus is that the Quad is here to stay, to undertake collaborative ventures for the public good. Through such functional cooperation, it will maintain a free and open Indo Pacific (FOIP) and challenge all efforts to seek hegemony in the region.\nAnchored by shared values, the Quad seeks to uphold the international order based on the rule of law. Respect for the leadership of regional institutions, including ASEAN is embedded in the preamble of the Wilmington Declaration.\nThe declaration clearly “reaffirms our consistent and unwavering support for ASEAN centrality and unity. We continue to support implementation of the ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific (AOIP) and are committed to ensuring the Quad’s work is aligned with ASEAN’s principles and priorities.”\n“We underscore ASEAN’s regional leadership role, including in the East Asia Summit, the region’s premier leader-led forum for strategic dialogue, and the ASEAN Regional Forum. As comprehensive strategic partners of ASEAN, our four countries intend to continue to strengthen our respective relationships with ASEAN and seek opportunities for greater Quad collaboration in support of the AOIP.”\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nThis is a resounding outreach to ASEAN’s basis and future.\nThe Quad, four leading maritime democracies in the Indo-Pacific, will engage with forms of functional, technological and related cooperation and engage countries and regional institutions, particularly ASEAN, the Pacific Islands Forum and the Indian Ocean Rim Association.\nThere are major thrust areas in which Quad consolidation is seen, which will benefit the region. The first of these is in the maritime domain. Given China's pressure on the Philippines, in the South China Sea, all Quad partners strengthened, individually, their relationship with the Philippines and have a common approach, which is not yet a formal Quad approach, but helps in building common understanding.\nAs many as 25 countries have benefited from the Indo-Pacific Partnership for Maritime Domain Awareness (IPMDA) related to dark vessel movements. They monitor activities in their exclusive economic zone (EEZ), with a particular focus on illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing. Most IUU fishing in the region is conducted by Chinese fishing boats guarded by the China Coast Guard, and this is a definite challenge.\nThis partnership is to encompass maritime security, to cover new technologies and data inflows. Three initiatives in this are now underway. For the first time, the Quad coast guards will launch a ship observer mission in 2025 to improve interoperability and coordination in the Indo-Pacific.\nA Quad Indo-Pacific logistics network pilot project is underway. This will seek a combined air lift capacity among Quad partners and leverage logistic strengths to provide high availability disaster recovery (HADR) in the region more effectively. HADR has been one of the cardinal principles since the 2004 tsunami in the region, which brought the Quad together.\nThis partnership came into play in May 2024, when landslides hit Papua New Guinea and Typhoon Yagi swept Vietnam, Myanmar and other ASEAN countries. For Myanmar, it is mainly an Indian effort, since other Quad members remain aloof from the Myanmar military junta.\nAnother important and clear challenge is the health partnership. By 2023 this had grown into the Quad Health Security Partnership, which looks at pandemic preparation. The current mpox outbreak is bringing together Quad efforts for equitable access to effective quality vaccines, which will include expanding vaccine manufacturing in developing countries.\nThe Quad Cancer Moonshot is another important initiative focusing on collaboration, including with private and civil society sectors, to reduce the incidence of suffering from cancer. Initially focusing on cervical cancer, it will work toward other forms.\nThe Quad countries will collaborate for further research and development to enhance the participation of the private and civil society sectors to reduce the incidence of cancer.\nThe Quad also wants to improve regional connectivity through quality infrastructure. New partnerships have been enunciated. This includes a partnership for ports of the future. The Quad infrastructure fellowships now cover 2,200 experts and works on disaster resilient infrastructure.\nThe Quad Partnership for Cable Connectivity and Resilience is providing quality undersea cable networks, which are free from domination. Australia has since July 2024 become a center for building human capacity, while Japan will provide technical cooperation for this, particularly in the South Pacific.\nThe US is expected to contribute training programs to support cable connectivity, which presently, is focusing on the Pacific Island countries and their requirements. India is working on the maintenance of such cables through harnessing Quad repair capabilities.\nFinally, the challenge of critical and emerging technologies is what the Quad is pursuing. The next real battle for the hearts and minds of all the countries in the Indo Pacific is over the access to transparently available and dependable technologies.\nEarlier, the open radio access network (RAN) in the Pacific was announced. Now this is being expanded to the ASEAN region, beginning with the Philippines. Japan and the US are supporting the global expansion of the RAN field trials and the Asia Open RAN Academy in the Philippines.\nQuad members consult frequently, exchange ideas to advance shared priorities and deliver benefits for partners across the Indo-Pacific.

The event features two exhibitions: Electric &amp; Power Indonesia and Water Indonesia, running until Saturday at the Jakarta International Expo (JIExpo) Kemayoran. The exhibition was officially inaugurated with presentations by Harris, S.T., M.T. (head of the Large Survey and Testing Center, Directorate General of New and Renewable Energy and Energy Conservation, Energy and Mineral Resources Ministry), Ir. Eddie Widiono S., M.Sc., M.M. (founder &amp; chief advisor of the Indonesia Smart Grid Initiative) and Lia Indriasari (country manager of Pamerindo Indonesia).\nThese two exhibitions will feature over 650 exhibitors from 44 countries in Halls A and D of JIExpo Kemayoran and will also host various seminars and discussions on multiple stages. The Water Indonesia exhibition will organize the Indonesia Water Forum, discussing \"The Transformation of Drinking Water Towards Golden Indonesia 2024\" in collaboration with the Indonesian Drinking Water Companies Association (PERPAMSI) and attended by representatives from various countries in the Southeast Asia Water Utilities Network (SEAWUN). Meanwhile, the Electric &amp; Power Indonesia exhibition will host various discussion sessions over four days in collaboration with the Indonesia Smart Grid Initiative (PJCI), the Indonesian Electricity Society (MKI), the National Battery Research Institute (NBRI) and the Asia Pacific Urban Energy Association (APUEA).\nPamerindo Indonesia, the organizer of the IEE Series 2024, expressed its vision to advance sustainable industry, particularly in the development of urban areas and sustainable cities. \"As the largest industrial platform in energy and engineering in Southeast Asia, IEE Series is committed to driving the nation's economy and providing a platform for business actors to meet and open cross-sector business opportunities, both nationally and internationally. Through this event, we also aim to support the government in achieving the renewable energy mix target of 23 percent by 2025. The collaboration and innovation realized here will be the driving force for advancing industry and sustainable development in Indonesia,\" said Lia Indriasari, country manager of Pamerindo Indonesia.\nIndonesia's renewable energy transition is expected to strengthen due to its substantial natural resources, supporting the shift from fossil energy to renewable energy, such as solar energy, geothermal, biomass, bioenergy and marine energy. Therefore, the Electric &amp; Power Indonesia exhibition specifically highlights \"The 22nd Series of Power Generation, Renewable Energy &amp; Electrical Equipment Exhibition\", showcasing two new areas: solar energy and batteries. In the solar energy sector, some exhibitors will showcase innovations in photovoltaic (PV) cell production equipment, solar cell application systems for various industrial needs such as air conditioning, street lights, solar cell raw materials and various supporting equipment, including software, storage technology and the solar panels themselves. In the storage or battery technology sector, various exhibitors will showcase the latest technology for charging and storing power for electronic devices, industrial equipment, renewable energy storage and electric vehicle charging technology.\nHarris, S.T., M.T., head of the Large Survey and Testing Center at the Directorate General of New and Renewable Energy and Energy Conservation at the Energy and Mineral Resources Ministry, stated during the opening ceremony of Energy Week - IEE Series 2024, \"Indonesia faces a significant challenge with 87 percent fossil energy use and LPG. The government has developed strategies to implement renewable energy and sustainability while boosting the economy and public welfare. Indonesia has substantial renewable energy potential, such as geothermal and various power plants from natural resources. However, the transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy requires involvement from the government, academia, state-owned enterprises, the private sector, media, financing institutions, industry, and others, enabling the government to act as a policy enabler. Thus, exhibitions like this are crucial to driving renewable energy targets by 2040.\"\nThe push for renewable energy aligns with the theme of Smart Urban Development &amp; Sustainable City. \"Fifty-two percent of Indonesia's 280 million population live in urban areas, and this number continues to increase. We need the development of smart cities, smart public services, comfortable infrastructure, integrated public transportation and various improvements. I appreciate this exhibition for accommodating our shared commitment to stepping toward the future and restoring the future of renewable energy. It can be a collaboration platform between academics, researchers, industry players and policymakers to promote the renewable energy ecosystem to reduce carbon emissions,\" said Ir. Eddie Widiono S., M.Sc., M.M., founder and chief advisor of PJCI.\nDuring IEE Series 2024 - Energy Week, various topics related to the energy industry and its issues will be widely discussed, involving industry players, association representatives, policymakers and the younger generation. Topics will vary across four stages, from discussions on hydrogen as an alternative clean energy source (Hydrogen as Clean Energy Source), the future road map for Indonesian electricity collaboration (Indonesian Electricity Collaboration Roadmap: Sustainable Energy Policies and Financing for Indonesia's Future) and water security,to Urban Energy Sessions and Power Talk to discuss the Nusantara Capital City (IKN) project as a smart city and various renewable energy alternatives and clean energy. In line with the vision of Energy Week, the Battery Show 2025, an initiative from the NBRI, will be launched at this exhibition, along with updates on various sustainability programs in Indonesia at Indonesia Sustainability Updates.\nEnsuring industrial sustainability in various SDG aspects\n&nbsp;Energy Week - IEE Series 2024 is expected to pioneer industrial sustainability by emphasizing the importance of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in various fields. Lia Indriasari, country manager of Pamerindo Indonesia, also emphasized in her speech that \"as part of our commitment to continually driving the sustainability agenda, we have undertaken many initiatives related to sustainability, reflected in every aspect we present in this exhibition, from energy management, waste management, carbon offset programs, inclusivity and diversity, to education and knowledge sharing. Last year, we successfully implemented 16 out of 17 SDG points.\" In the field of education and innovation, Pamerindo Indonesia presents the Connecting the Disconnected program, which aims to connect academics, researchers and students directly with industries and related associations. Some programs involve industry players and association representatives offering scholarships to students from three major universities in Indonesia, as well as a Student Visit program from various engineering study programs at universities during the 4-day Energy Week. On the final day of Energy Week, the SHARE-PIE program titled \"Innovation Opportunity In Indonesia Energy Sector\" will be held, which is a program awarding technology innovation by the younger generation to advance the energy sector.\nIn transportation and emissions reduction, Energy Week also collaborates with several parties to promote the transition to electric vehicles. Pamerindo collaborates with INVI and KALISTA (a member of Indika Energy Group) to provide electric vehicle charging infrastructure and free EV shuttle buses to and from departure points at Senayan City and Pondok Indah Mall to JIExpo. During Energy Week, several electric vehicle charging stations will be available through partnerships with SSKTama and Starvo.\nPamerindo also envisions educating the exhibition procurement or meetings, incentives, conferences and exhibitions (MICE) industry toward more sustainable practices through collaboration with several parties. In collaboration with Fairatmos, Pamerindo Indonesia will implement a Carbon Offset program during the IEE Series 2024 to balance the carbon emissions of visitors traveling to JIExpo with various land restoration and conservation projects, as well as geothermal energy conservation projects in several regions in Indonesia. Visitors are encouraged to calculate their carbon emissions during their journey to JIExpo by accessing\nhttp://bit.ly/carbonoffsetatIEE\n, and Pamerindo will offset these emissions through environmental sustainability projects.\nTo further educate visitors about sustainability aspects, the IEE Series will also highlight the Better Stand program, where Pamerindo Indonesia educates exhibitors to avoid using single-use stand construction materials and consistently apply sustainability aspects in their stands.\nThrough the Electric &amp; Power Indonesia and Water Indonesia exhibitions, IEE Series - Energy Week is expected to provide solutions for urban, city and exhibition industry sustainability. Visit\nbit.ly/PR_IEE24\nfor access and the latest information about seminars, exhibitions and other supporting events during Energy Week.

Through implementing health initiatives in companies, HR departments and leaders need to analyze employee needs to design appropriate programs.\nSteps that can be taken include providing facilities and education, as well as monitoring and evaluating results periodically. This ensures that wellness programs provide real benefits to employees and the company.\nIn addition, the summit emphasized the importance of creating a positive work culture by promoting open communication, encouraging team collaboration, providing recognition for achievements, building trust and engagement, and providing support for employee professional development.\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get ‘closer to the people’: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Article\nHealing our planet is now restoration, not just conservation\nPrabowo mulls extending tour to Middle East\nXi, Biden attend APEC summit, prepare to meet\nAPRIL Group underlines commitment to sustainable production, forest management at COP29\nRevisiting Indonesia’s surprising BRICS plan\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get ‘closer to the people’: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nMore in Front row\nView more\nFront Row\nThink Business, Think Hong Kong: Spotlighting Asia opportunities in Jakarta\nFront Row\nBPJS Kesehatan partners with stakeholders to build a fraud-free JKN ecosystem\nFront Row\nFore Coffee ends the year strong with hopeful prospects and locally focused products\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo’s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?\nAcademia\nStop with the LGBTQ scapegoating\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nAcademia\nNavigating Indonesia-US relations amid global and domestic changes"

A standout feature of the program was the collaborative facilitation by Australian and Indonesian educational experts, which secured a dynamic knowledge exchange and minimized linguistic obstacles, thus elevating its relevance and significance.\nAs Indonesia deals with the challenges of modern governance, it becomes crucial to adapt leadership training to the country's unique cultural, social and political contexts. The \"Bridging Continents: Education Leadership and Management Excellence for Indonesian Policymakers Program in Australia\" was recently initiated at the University of Canberra. Its success highlights the value of such specialized training.\nThis program, funded by the World Bank, equips Indonesian policymakers with global perspectives while ensuring the applicability of these insights within local contexts.\nLeadership training from developed countries often lacks the contextual depth and specificity necessary for Indonesian settings. The program exemplifies how to address these gaps by a deliberate co-design process and incorporating the cultural, social and political nuances of Indonesia into its curriculum.\nThis integration is achieved through continuous dialogue between the University of Canberra staff, the Religious Affairs Ministry and Indonesian education experts. This targeted and dialogic approach ensures that the perspectives, knowledge and skills obtained are directly applicable, enhancing the effectiveness of our policymakers in tackling local challenges.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nBy emphasizing cultural respect and relevance, the program ensures that educational advancements align with Indonesia's unique governance needs, enabling training to move beyond academic theory and achieve practical innovation.\nExposure to global perspectives fosters a broader understanding and innovative thinking among Indonesian policymakers. The true value of such a leadership development program in cross-cultural settings lies in its adaptation to the local context, drawing upon participants’ wealth of knowledge and experiences. &nbsp;\nThe \"Bridging Continents\" initiative serves as a model, showing how global best practices can be reshaped to fit Indonesia’s specific circumstances. This adaptation enhances the program’s relevance and effectiveness, positioning it as a vital resource for transformative leadership.\nBeyond immediate skills acquisition, the sustainability of leadership improvement is crucial. The program is intentionally crafted not only to impart knowledge but also to nurture sustainable capabilities that have a long-term impact on policy development. With ongoing support and mentoring, the initiative ensures that learning continues post-training, fostering a generation of leaders who are well-equipped to implement lasting changes in Indonesia.\nProfessional networking forms a core component of effective leadership training. By connecting Indonesian policymakers with international experts and fellow policymakers, programs like \"Bridging Continents\" facilitate rich exchanges of ideas and collaborative solutions to shared challenges. These networks are invaluable resources that enhance the policymaking process and support the development of consensus-driven and culturally informed policies.\nTargeted leadership development equips Indonesian policymakers with advanced decision-making skills essential for navigating the complex and rapidly evolving global landscape. The training sharpens their strategic thinking and improves the capacity to balance diverse stakeholder interests, ensuring decisions are both informed and inclusive.\nMoreover, this program offers a platform for educators from Australia and Indonesia to engage in meaningful intercultural exchanges, enhancing our collective insight and collaboration.\nTo further enhance an enduring impact, leadership training should be tailored not only to cultural contexts but also to specific policy domains such as education at different levels, including national, provincial, district and school levels. This specificity increases the relevance and applicability of training content, directly addressing the day-to-day challenges faced by policymakers in these fields.\nAnother distinctive feature of the leadership program was the series of visits to a variety of educational institutions, encompassing both religious and secular settings. These included public, private and independent schools, catering to students from elementary through to college levels, as well as a school that specializes in distance education. Participants provided highly positive feedback on their experiences, reflecting on the diverse educational environments they observed.\nFor example, participant 1 noted, \"The warmth in the interactions between teachers and students was truly inspiring.\" Participant 2 observed the meticulous attention to detail in educational practices, stating, \"Education management is incredibly thorough, right down to the size and colour of the text for distance education, reflecting a strong adherence to research outcomes.\"\nParticipant 3 commented on the professionalism within the schools: \"Educational practitioners appear highly professional.\" Echoing this sentiment, participant 4 added, \"Teachers are rigorously selected, displaying profound professionalism in classroom management.\"\nParticipant 5 admired the student engagement strategies, mentioning, \"Student work is prominently displayed on the walls as a form of appreciation.\" Participant 6 highlighted an often-overlooked aspect, saying, \"The cleanliness of the schools is paramount, contributing significantly to the learning environment.\"\nThese comments highlighted the comprehensive and effective educational practices observed during the visits.\nThe \"Bridging Continents\" initiative by the University of Canberra is a pioneering example of how leadership development programs can effectively bridge the gap between global insights and local applications. By focusing on cultural contextualization, sustainability and customization, such programs prepare Indonesian policymakers not just to meet the current demands of their roles but to excel in them, driving Indonesia forward in an increasingly complex world.\nAs we further refine and expand these models, the potential for significant and sustainable improvements in Indonesian governance becomes immense.\n***\nSitti Maesuri Patahuddin is an associate professor and the director of Indonesian Partnerships at the Faculty of Education, University of Canberra.

(Antara/Maria Cicilia)\nR\necent international projections have raised world growth expectations to 2.6 percent, with emerging and developing economies leading the rebound with an average of 4 percent. In contrast, advanced economies are forecast to expand more modestly, at 1.5 percent.\nChile is not separate from this trend. Estimations from the country’s Finance Ministry and central bank point to 2-3 percent economic growth in 2024, a figure backed by similar projections from international organizations such as the World Bank, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the International Monetary Fund.\nThe projections for international trade are equally optimistic. The IMF, the OECD and World Trade Organization (WTO) project an increase in trade flows of between 2.3 and 3 percent by 2024 and 3.3 percent by 2025. These numbers reflect a recovery in world trade driven by robust global economic growth.\nChile, recognized worldwide as a reliable and safe destination for investment, faces the crucial task of diversifying its trade partners and attracting more foreign direct investment (FDI).\nChile’s President Gabriel Boric announced that in 2023, we had achieved the highest FDI figure since 2015 with more than US$21.7 billion invested, which analysts have recognized. Promoting and strengthening our international ties to diversify our destination markets and investment sources is therefore vital to boost growth and productivity in Chile.\nFDI could support trade and integration into global value chains, encourage innovation and promote better-paid jobs and sustainable development.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nThrough President Boric's mandate, we will continue our firm commitment to opening new markets for our exporters and attracting diverse capital that promotes sustainable economies and improves the well-being of our societies.\nNonetheless, we cannot ignore the global geopolitical context in which we find ourselves, characterized by armed conflicts, a scarcity of natural resources, the climate crisis and the contentious trade relationship between great powers.\nThis situation poses a significant challenge to generating greater resilience in supply chains, fostering regional integration and strengthening ties with trading partners to mitigate risks.\nChile and Indonesia emerge as complementary partners in this complex panorama of international trade. Both countries are rich in natural resources (key to the global energy transition) and are actively seeking to expand their commercial horizons.\nIndonesia, one of the economies with higher growth in Southeast Asia, and Chile, a solid economy in Latin America, strengthened their complementarities by implementing the Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) in August 2019, initially focused on the exchange of goods.\nIn the almost five years since, the agreement has increased bilateral trade, with average annual growth of 11.2 percent. It is worth highlighting that Chilean exports to Indonesia include copper, wood and salmon, and imports from Indonesia include passenger cars, footwear and chemical products. This firm growth reflects the synergy between both nations and underlines the potential for further mutual economic development.\nTo continue strengthening our economic relationship with Indonesia, we have incorporated trade in services into our bilateral economic comprehensive agreement, allowing us to boost commercial exchange in this sector.\nAccording to data from the WTO, trade in services registered 9 percent growth globally in 2023. This advance, already approved by the National Congress of Chile, could increase access to professional services of various types (legal, architecture, engineering, medical and dental, informatics, research and development, cultural and transportation, among other areas), providing certainty and predictability in the exports of both countries.\nI recently visited Indonesia to advance the deepening of the CEPA, incorporating an investment chapter that will provide legal certainty and improve the regulatory capacity of our states. This visit reaffirms our commitment to diversifying and strengthening our commercial ties, thus promoting a future of growth and shared prosperity.\nWith the deepening of economic-trade relations, we hope that Indonesia can see our country as a platform for integration and rapprochement with Latin America, especially South America.\nFor Chile, Indonesia can be projected as a key market in its diversification strategy, both in its export basket and destinations, opening new opportunities to improve the quality of life in both countries.\n***\nThe writer is undersecretary of international economic relations of Chile.\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get ‘closer to the people’: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nActivists call for accountability in a year filled with police brutality\nRelated Article\nJapan seeks Indonesia’s help to solve labor crisis\nMission to Syria\nIndonesia’s drive for AI leadership in Southeast Asia\nGovt eyes $6 billion in forex revenue from solar power exports\nASEAN in the global economy: A half-century journey\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get ‘closer to the people’: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nActivists call for accountability in a year filled with police brutality\nMore in Opinion\nView more\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo’s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?\nAcademia\nStop with the LGBTQ scapegoating\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nAcademia\nNavigating Indonesia-US relations amid global and domestic changes"

(Reuters/Ajeng Dinar Ulfiana)\nT\nhe pandemic, while a distant memory for many of us, has left a lasting impact on healthcare systems worldwide, including in Indonesia. Driven by pent-up demand and increased health awareness, Indonesian healthcare spending has surged, with medical inflation reaching double digits and health insurance claims increasing by nearly 25 percent in 2024, outpacing the Asian average.\nA multitude of factors are driving this change — increase in input costs for drugs and consumables, exchange rate deterioration, greater awareness among patients, greater utilization of health resources and the ever-present fraud and abuse that plagues the industry.\nThese dynamics are making the economics unviable for participants across the healthcare ecosystem. As a result, several healthcare providers have had to respond by transferring elevated costs to patients and payers. Health payers are exploring avenues to refine claims process and improve the cost-effectiveness of treatments. Patients are having to postpone elective medical treatment or seek care at alternative locations.\nSolutions need to be found and will require stakeholders to work collaboratively to ensure the best interests of the patient and the nation are served, while ensuring individual motivations are not adversely impacted.\nHealthcare providers: Be lean yet innovative\nHealthcare providers are the primary touchpoint for patients. Their actions are therefore critical to ensuring cost management while delivering positive outcomes.\nProspects\nEvery Monday\nWith exclusive interviews and in-depth coverage of the region's most pressing business issues, \"Prospects\" is the go-to source for staying ahead of the curve in Indonesia's rapidly evolving business landscape.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nThere are three dimensions which providers need to look at. First, there is a need to apply the classic principles of lean day-to-day management of healthcare facilities — procurement excellence to maximize value in purchase of drugs and consumables, lean service operations to maximize clinician utilization and redesign of care delivery processes to improve throughput. Clinicians are the costliest and the scarcest resource in a hospital setting and driving their utilization and productivity is critical for optimal business economics.\nSecond, the Omnibus Health Law now provides private providers with the opportunity to deploy foreign medical talent. It is imperative that providers plan well and leverage this opportunity to mitigate crucial clinical talent challenges. Providers could proactively partner with international medical groups of repute to bring the much-needed talent, upskill local Indonesian talent and get access to clinical protocols to enable care delivery at cost.\nThird, there is a need to embrace alternative models of care — virtual, telehealth and ambulatory care. In most developed healthcare systems, alternative care models are gradually becoming the norm, rather than the exception, be it virtual wards in the United Kingdom’s NHS, or ambulatory surgical centres being piloted by several private providers in the region. With these models, providers have the opportunity to not just reduce cost, but also enhance patient experience.\nSustainable healthcare future. (BCG/-)\nHealth insurers: From payers to partners\nHealth insurers have traditionally been payers of care delivery. It is time for them to pivot from being mere “wallets” to becoming “activist partners” managing the health for their policyholders. They can do so by three key interventions.\nFirst and foremost, insurers need to intervene earlier in patient journeys through wellness, prevention and early detection programs. Early treatment costs are two to four times lower than late-stage treatments. Several insurers in ASEAN have taken steps in this direction, for example, incentivizing gym memberships and healthy food habits, or offering preventive health management services. In Singapore, with the advent of Healthier SG, the state itself has been leading the push.\nSecond, insurers need to establish primary-care-first, preferred healthcare provider networks. A primary-care-first network, in which general practitioners (GPs) and primary care providers act as the first point of contact, can help minimize the need for expensive tertiary care. This needs to be coupled with creating preferred partnerships and hybrid delivery models enabling care in lower acuity settings. Insurers could also incentivize treatment in lower-acuity settings, such as shifting from inpatient to day surgery, or from hospitals to community clinics.\nThird, insurers need to take control over the patient journey. Patients often lack adequate information to judge which care option is most appropriate. The choice of care then gets influenced by intermediaries, friends and family, or online reviews. Insurers have access to extensive data regarding clinical outcomes and care cost at individual providers, and are in a good position to guide their patients regarding choice of treatment and treatment provider. Hence, it is important that insurers implement interventions to proactively guide patients and steer them toward the most appropriate provider and care pathway.\nThe state: Powering up the ecosystem\nThe role of the state is equally essential. Important first steps have been taken regarding localization of medical devices and allowing foreign clinical talent to practice. A lot more can be done.\nFirst, there has been a commendable push toward indigenization. There is now a need to ensure locally manufactured drugs, consumables and devices are of excellent quality, which will give clinicians the confidence to use local products. Besides reducing costs, a “quality indigenous” product will also build self-reliance and shock-proof the local healthcare industry from supply chain and exchange rate fluctuations.\nSecond, there is a need for continued investment in the local clinician talent pool by expanding specialist training programs. While access to foreign doctors is an important immediate measure, building the pipeline for local specialists is equally essential to ensure a stronger future for Indonesia.\nThird, there is an opportunity to develop or bring in evidence-based clinical pathways with buy-in of local clinicians. This will not only drive improvements in quality of care, it will also help standardize and control costs. Several health systems in the United States, including Geisinger Health System's ProvenCare and Intermountain Healthcare's Heart Failure program, have shown significant benefits using this approach. Indonesia can benefit from adopting similar practices.\nShared steps for success\nIn many developed health systems, an inherent integration of payers and providers, alongside funding limits, serves as a natural force for the above actions. In Indonesia, however, payers, providers and individuals will need to drive concerted efforts to adapt their roles and practices.

(JP/Ni Komang Erviani)\nAs the World Water Forum unfolds in Bali, a critical issue takes center stage: Water scarcity.\nThis global event, convening water experts and decision-makers every three years, provides a unique platform to tackle this pressing challenge. Nowhere is this challenge more evident than on the very island hosting the forum,&nbsp;Bali, the “Island of the Gods.”\nDecades of tourism and unchecked development have strained Bali’s water resources to a critical point. The Ayung Watershed, a vital source of life for the island, exemplifies this crisis. Over-extraction of groundwater and deforestation have led to increased water runoff, jeopardizing the water security of communities and ecosystems.\nThe consequences are dire. Vulnerable communities, particularly those reliant on agriculture, are the first to suffer.\nWater scarcity can lead to poverty, food insecurity and displacement. The increased water runoff caused by deforestation weakens the soil, making it more susceptible to devastating landslides. Furthermore, saltwater intrusion becomes a growing threat as freshwater reserves dwindle, contaminating coastal aquifers and rendering them unusable for agriculture or drinking.\nHowever, a beacon of hope shines from the Ayung Watershed. A payment for ecosystem services (PES) scheme offers a promising approach to tackle this challenge, and is being presented as a case study at the World Water Forum.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nPES is a market-based solution where water users, such as businesses, provide financial support for sustainable land management practices by local communities. These practices include building infiltration wells to replenish groundwater reserves and implementing regenerative agroforestry techniques that improve water retention in the soil.\nA key aspect of the Ayung Watershed PES scheme is multi-stakeholder collaboration. It brings together government agencies, businesses, NGOs and local communities to achieve a common goal,&nbsp;improving Bali’s water security.\nThis initiative showcases the potential of PES as a tool for financing water resilience and promoting sustainable development, offering valuable insights for the global water community gathered at the World Water Forum.\nThis year's World Water Forum theme, \"Water for Shared Prosperity\", underscores the urgent need for innovative solutions like the Ayung Watershed PES scheme.\nThe global context for water scarcity is stark. Droughts plague many countries year after year. Nearly half of the world's water bodies are compromised by poor water quality.\nThe United Nations has estimated about half of the world's population, 4 billion people, face water shortages at least once a year. By 2025, 1.8 billion people will have to endure severe water shortages.\nClimate change and land-use practices are further degrading water resources, while demand for water is expected to surge by 20-30 percent by 2050, fueled by a growing global population.\nA leading challenge is balancing immediate human needs with the long-term health of freshwater ecosystems. The PES scheme offers a promising contribution to achieving this balance.\nBy financially incentivizing landowners to adopt sustainable land management practices, these programs can achieve a double win. Upstream communities benefit from financial rewards for their conservation efforts, while downstream users enjoy improved water security.\nThis approach, built on multi-stakeholder collaboration, protects vital water resources and reverses the degradation of ecosystems, contributing to a sustainable water future. The Ayung Watershed PES scheme, an example of effective collaboration, has the potential to be a replicable model for water-stressed regions around the world.\nThe World Water Forum presents an important platform to showcase this scheme as a promising model for water management, and stimulate discussions on how PES can contribute to global water security.\nBy working together, we can turn Bali’s experiment into a blueprint for a more sustainable water future, one where shared prosperity is built on a foundation of shared resources.\n***\nThe writer is managing director at Kopernik, an Indonesian-based research and development (R&amp;D) lab for social and environmental challenges.\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get ‘closer to the people’: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nActivists call for accountability in a year filled with police brutality\nRelated Article\nAustralia to charge tech companies for news content if they do not pay\nAn illuminated wonderland awaits at Sofitel Bali Nusa Dua Beach Resort\nAI Day drives Indonesia's AI sovereignty, with Indosat leading solutions and connectivity\nWhy we have to continuously update the poverty line\nMove smarter, breathe easier: Recipe for a global city\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get ‘closer to the people’: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nActivists call for accountability in a year filled with police brutality\nMore in Opinion\nView more\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo’s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?\nAcademia\nStop with the LGBTQ scapegoating\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nAcademia\nNavigating Indonesia-US relations amid global and domestic changes"

For example, solutions from Compal Electronics, IBASE Technology, Touché Solutions and Huen Chen Machinery, among others, are gaining favor among Indonesian buyers. Huen Chen Machinery, a first-time participant at the Taiwan Expo, is seeking distributors in Indonesia. Through the exhibition's business meeting sessions, the company not only met with qualified machinery distributors but also held discussions with numerous buyers regarding large riveting machines. The accuracy of the matchmaking has been praised by the company.\nIn Indonesia, where the climate is hot, Zirco Applied Materials' has a wide range of applications for thermal barrier films. This exhibition also attracted Indonesia’s real estate and channel partners for potential collaboration. A surveillance system manufacturer with its own sales channels and extensive connections is optimistic about the potential of the local market and wants to enter the field of building insulation, visited Zirco's booth three times during the exhibition and showed a high degree of willingness to cooperate.\nIn compliance with Indonesia’s targeted ban on single-use plastic bags and utensils, eco-friendly products from Taiwan gained the interest of buyers. Wonder Greener's straw products, made from papyrus plants have been attracting interest from hotels, restaurants and other related buyers in Indonesia. The company offers customers a comprehensive solution for recycling straw from planting to manufacturing, helping businesses enhance their ESG brand image.\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get ‘closer to the people’: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nActivists call for accountability in a year filled with police brutality\nRelated Article\nUS drawing up contingency plans for Taiwan emergency\nSustainable business innovations key to accelerating Indonesia’s NDC targets: APRIL Group\nHealing our planet is now restoration, not just conservation\nJapan PM expressed 'serious concerns' to Xi over South China Sea situation\nTaiwanese textile manufacturers keen to invest in RI, Airlangga says\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get ‘closer to the people’: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nActivists call for accountability in a year filled with police brutality\nMore in Front row\nView more\nFront Row\nThink Business, Think Hong Kong: Spotlighting Asia opportunities in Jakarta\nFront Row\nBPJS Kesehatan partners with stakeholders to build a fraud-free JKN ecosystem\nFront Row\nFore Coffee ends the year strong with hopeful prospects and locally focused products\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo’s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?\nAcademia\nStop with the LGBTQ scapegoating\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nAcademia\nNavigating Indonesia-US relations amid global and domestic changes"

It is a major point of concern for EV owners, and without proper maintenance, can significantly depreciate a car’s value.\nVinFast’s battery subscription program aims to tackle this issue by decoupling the price of batteries from the vehicles itself. The decoupling is claimed to significantly reduce the cost of battery replacements for EV owners and helps combat battery degradation. It also provides more affordability at different budget ranges, offering prospective EV drivers a multitude of entry points for purchasing a vehicle.\nAdditionally, VinFast’s subscription model ensures peak battery condition through free maintenance and replacement when battery health falls below 70 percent of original capacity. VinFast claims their new battery subscription plan will bring the operating costs down to a more competitive level in comparison to gas-powered vehicles.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\nAside from economic benefits for its customers, VinFast’s battery subscription policy will also positively impact the environment.\nProspects\nEvery Monday\nWith exclusive interviews and in-depth coverage of the region's most pressing business issues, \"Prospects\" is the go-to source for staying ahead of the curve in Indonesia's rapidly evolving business landscape.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nWith regular maintenance included in their innovative policy, VinFast’s EVs can have an extended battery life, which translates to fewer battery replacements overall and reduced environmental impact.\nThe battery subscription policy aligns with VinFast’s goals of pursuing a circular economic model. Its EV batteries are sourced from leading battery companies, which boast a 95 percent recyclability metric. And the replaced batteries from the subscription plan will be repurposed in energy storage units.\nFurthermore, VinFast has partnered with Canadian battery recycling company Li-Cycle to properly manage their battery repurposing processes. They have also established a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Japanese trading and investment conglomerate Marubeni Corporation to research potential secondary uses for EV batteries and further possibilities of establishing a circular economy model.\nBy prioritizing battery health, proper battery management and responsible recycling, VinFast aims to not only help reduce customers expenses, but to also positively impact the environment in Indonesia.\nWith a strong dedication to the goal of a circular economy, VinFast’s strategy in Indonesia is another example of its focus on sustainability and making a difference on a global scale.\nVinFast’s first dealership branch in Indonesia, located in Depok City\nLastly, VinFast is officially opening its first ever dealer store in Indonesia, with plans to expand across major Indonesian cities throughout 2024. Located in Depok City, just west of Jakarta, PT Gallerie Setia Utama’s VinFast store is fully equipped with a suite of services for their customers, ranging from professional consulting, sales, and customer care.

While AI can bring certain advantages when integrated into a company’s operations, key decision makers should be mindful of their AI solutions, in order to ensure that the practice is free from controversy.\nSheena Suparman\n(The Jakarta Post)\nJakarta\nWed, March 13, 2024\nShare this article\nFacebook\nWhatApp\nX\nLinkedIn\nTelegram\nEmail\nhttp://www.thejakartapost.com/business/2024/03/13/safeguarding-the-future-of-artificial-intelligence.html\nCopy Link\nGift Full Article\nChange text size\nA\nA\nA\nGift Full Article\nGift Premium Articles\nto Anyone\nShare the best of The Jakarta Post with friends, family, or colleagues. As a subscriber, you can gift 3 to 5 articles each month that anyone can read—no subscription needed!\nLog in\nSubscribe\n(Courtesy of IBM)\nO\nne of the problems that may arise is AI hallucination, which is a phenomenon wherein a large language model (LLM) perceives patterns or objects that are nonexistent or imperceptible, creating outputs that are nonsensical, inaccurate and are not based on training data.\nAI hallucinations have also led to headlines recently. One of the most famous stories include when an AI started a love story for the digital age when it admitted to falling in love with a user and even encouraged him to dissolve his marriage.\nWhen used irresponsibly, AI has the potential to erode trust, propagate inequality and create harm. Therefore, companies have to be able to prioritize ethical principles to integrate the new technological innovation in order to gain more trust, instead of dismantle it.\nA study by the Institute for Business Value found that of the 79 percent of executives believe AI ethics are important to their enterprise-wide approach, while fewer than 25 percent have operationalized ethics governance principles. AI governance is a critical element that needs to be prioritized for an AI system to truly benefit all stakeholders.\nThe ethics of it all\nFirst of all, users need to keep in mind the purpose of AI is to augment human intelligence, not replace it. The data and insights generated belong to a creator or a company.\nProspects\nEvery Monday\nWith exclusive interviews and in-depth coverage of the region's most pressing business issues, \"Prospects\" is the go-to source for staying ahead of the curve in Indonesia's rapidly evolving business landscape.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nMoreover, IBM has broken down principles as “pillars of trust,” which are explainability, fairness, robustness, transparency and privacy. The first basically means to ensure that users know the decision-making processes of the AI system, therefore they can comprehend and trust the results and output created by the algorithms.\nWhen properly regulated, AI can assist humans in making fairer choices. Since the system of AI is based on machine learning, at the end of the day, any bias in the output usually lies in statistical discrimination based off of its training data.\nThe AI system also has to be robust. Research has shown that even small, imperceptible variations in the input data may lead AI models into incorrect decisions. Therefore, the system needs to be designed and developed to be strong against real-world variations, as well as evaluated and optimized accordingly.\nTransparency is the key to trustworthiness. For it to be transparent, the capabilities and purpose of the algorithms must be openly and clearly communicated to relevant stakeholders.\nThe last pillar may be the focus of most conversations surrounding the disadvantage of AI. It is clear that AI systems must prioritize and safeguard consumers’ privacy and data rights.\nPwC’s 2024 Global Digital Trust Survey shows that mega breaches are increasing in number, scale and cost, with 36 percent of respondents revealing a cost of US$1 million or more for their worst breach in the past three years globally.\nHowever, steps can be taken to prevent data breaches. This includes incorporating privacy-enhancing technologies, anonymizing data, and adopting robust security measures.\nFurthermore, AI requires an open and diverse ecosystem, fostering a culture where diversity, inclusion and shared responsibility are imperative. This includes the datasets, practitioners and more.\nOffering solutions to the problems\nWith the vast growth of AI usage and networks all over the world, certain government agencies have come up with a set of regulations regarding the technology. Perhaps the most famous, the European Union-launched AI Act, the world’s first comprehensive AI law.\nFirst introduced in April 2021, the European Commission proposed the first EU regulatory framework for AI that states that systems that can be used in different applications are analyzed and classified according to the risk they pose to users. The different risk levels will mean more or less regulation.\nPreviously, in 2019, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Council adopted the Recommendations on Artificial Intelligence, entitled “OECD AI Principles.” The document includes five values-based principles and recommendations for OECD countries and adhering partner economies to promote responsible and trustworthy AI policies.\nHowever, most believe that the responsibility and ethical behavior should lie with the inventors themselves. This is a value that has been embedded in the vision and mission of IBM. Therefore, the company strongly supports the regulations set forth by the EU and OECD.\nAs one of the biggest technology companies in the world, IBM has been leading advances in innovations, including in AI. In order to ensure that the system created is responsible and more beneficial, IBM offers a “Precision Regulation for AI” that outlines a risk-based framework for industry and governments to work together in a system of co-regulation.\nWhile acknowledging that a “one-size-fit-all” policy is not a realistic approach based on the many unique characteristics of AI systems, IBM proposes three pillars of policy framework; accountability and transparency, as well as fairness and security.\nHowever, the company acknowledges that there needs to be an open collaboration between the government and the private sector. IBM’s framework is in line with the Communications and Information Ministry’s circular letter no. 9/2023 that emphasizes the values of inclusivity, accessibility, security, humanity, as well as credibility and accountability in the use of AI.\n“We believe in all the principles mentioned above and have implemented them. Because in the end, the benefits of AI stand to grow exponentially. But only if society trusts it. With trust as the cornerstone for AI innovation, businesses must leverage AI as a force for positive change. Remember, this is a marathon, not a sprint. And at this moment in the long arc of human progress, that matters not just for our company, but for our customers and society as a whole,” concluded Roy Kosasih, country manager of IBM Indonesia.\nThis article is published in collaboration with IBM\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get ‘closer to the people’: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Article\nRussia teams up with BRICS to create AI alliance\nIndonesia’s drive for AI leadership in Southeast Asia\nSingaporean ministers among over 100 victims of blackmail over deepfake images\nRise of the machine?

(Unsplash/Geri Mis) (Unsplash/Geri Mis)\nIn today’s interconnected world, empathy seems to be increasingly scarce. Statistics paint a concerning picture.\nIn Indonesia, a 2023 study by Yogyakarta-based Gadjah Mada University revealed a growing intergroup prejudice, particularly among the youth. Similarly, a 2022 report from the United Kingdom's Runnymede Trust highlighted enduring ethnic inequalities stemming from a deficit of understanding and empathy.\nThe challenge is evident: Bridging the gap with those who appear different.\nThese consequences extend widely, fueling societal polarization, stifling meaningful dialogue, and obstructing our capacity to address complex global challenges that require collaborative solutions. Whether addressing climate change or economic disparity, a dearth of empathy can exacerbate existing problems and prevent us from working together for a better future.\nSo, where lies the solution? While technology offers connectivity, genuine empathy requires more than a digital connection. It demands active participation, open hearts, and a willingness to step outside our comfort zones. This is where the transformative power of cross-cultural collaboration comes in.\nEngaging in collaborative artistic endeavors that transcend cultural and geographical barriers enables individuals to cultivate profound empathy, dismantle stereotypes, and build bridges of understanding, paving the way for a more compassionate, connected, peaceful, and prosperous world.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nThroughout history, art has catalyzed empathy, fostering understanding across cultures and generations. Artists have utilized art as a platform to advocate for peace, resonating across geographical and temporal divides.\nSimilarly, Beethoven's symphonies craft a universal language of joy and sorrow, uniting hearts despite linguistic differences. These are just a couple of examples to underscore art's enduring capacity to forge visceral connections.\nToday, the enduring legacy of fostering empathy thrives in collaborative art projects, where diverse voices and perspectives can intertwine. Take \"The School of Hope\" in Indonesia, which provides a platform for young individuals from various backgrounds to explore empathy through art creation, challenging stereotypes, and fostering connections through shared creativity. Similarly, \"Care Krisis\", a digital theatre collaboration between the UK and Indonesia, addressed the complex issue of aging populations, prompting global audiences to contemplate shared global challenges with empathetic eyes.\nNestled within the vibrant cultural landscape of Yogyakarta, \"The School of Hope'' embarked on its transformative journey, bringing together youth from the deaf community, Islamic boarding school students, and other marginalized backgrounds.\nThis unique project, spearheaded by PSBK (Indonesia) and The Paper Birds (UK), and supported by the British Council’s Connections Through Culture grants, embraced art as a catalyst for exploring empathy, not just as an emotion but as a multifaceted concept with personal and societal implications.\nThrough a structured series of \"5 lessons\", the workshops skillfully blended cognitive, intuitive, and creative pathways. Interactive exercises like \"empathy mapping\" challenged participants to empathize with others’ perspectives, while collaborative art-making provided a safe space for self-expression and shared experiences.\nOne young deaf participant noted how the program not only enhanced their communication skills but also deepened their understanding of other people’s emotions, effectively breaking down barriers and building bridges of empathy across seemingly disparate backgrounds.\nTestimonies from participants highlighted how art transcended language and cultural differences, fostering genuine connections and a shared sense of humanity among individuals who may have never interacted otherwise.\n\"Care Krisis\" stands as a testament to the transformative potential of digital theatre in igniting global conversations on intricate issues. This innovative project brought together theatre companies Zoo Co (UK) and Sakatoya (Indonesia) to delve into the interconnected challenges of aging populations and their impact on both environmental sustainability and social care needs.\nLive performances in each country, seamlessly intertwined with pre-recorded video backdrops, created a captivating hybrid experience. Actors grappled with these pressing issues, their diverse cultural perspectives enriching the narrative and sparking audience reflection.\nOne reviewer commented that \"Care Krisis\" transcended mere entertainment, prompting viewers to \"consider the future we're building, not just for ourselves, but for generations to come.\" This digital collaboration illustrates how art transcends physical boundaries, nurturing empathy toward shared global challenges, and inspiring collective action through creative storytelling.\nWhile the potential of cross-cultural art collaborations is undeniable, hurdles exist, including language barriers, navigating cultural sensitivities, and funding limitations. However, proactive planning, cultural awareness training, collaborative problem-solving, and the dedication of passionate individuals and organizations can overcome these challenges.\nThe fabric of humanity is beautifully intricate, woven from countless threads of diverse cultures and perspectives. Fostering empathy, understanding, and collaboration is crucial for building a just and compassionate world.\nLet's champion cross-cultural art initiatives, bridging divides and sparking meaningful conversations. Through the transformative power of art, we can weave a tapestry of empathy, one brushstroke, one melody, one shared experience at a time, celebrating differences and paving the way for a brighter future for all.\nThe canvas is set, and the paints await. Join hands, share stories, and let art ignite the spark of empathy. Support collaborations, participate in workshops, and become an agent of understanding.\nTogether, we can paint a world where differences are embraced, not feared, and empathy guides us toward a future woven with compassion.\n***\nThe writer is the country director for Indonesia and director Southeast Asia at British Council\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get ‘closer to the people’: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Article\nBNPT, PNM strengthen collaboration to combat radicalism through economic empowerment\nMemories of Aceh Chinese: We too remember, we too belong\n‘Wong urip urup’: Transforming collectivism into innovation\nMIT's blueprint and Indonesia's cultural challenges to achieve the 2045 vision\nPartnership for prosperity between Indonesia and Africa\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get ‘closer to the people’: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nMore in Opinion\nView more\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo’s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?\nAcademia\nStop with the LGBTQ scapegoating\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nAcademia\nNavigating Indonesia-US relations amid global and domestic changes"

(Antara/Rizka Khaerunnisa)\nF\nrom the inception of the aviation industry, the transportation of passengers and cargo by air has played a central role. Very few air passengers’ journeys begin and end at the airport. Rather, they start their journey at home, from a hotel or their office and want to end it somewhere similar, be it for business or pleasure.\nHowever, it can sometimes take longer to get to and from the airport than the actual duration of the flight. Further, many airports are underserved by public transportation and have disproportionate pricing options.\nExamples of this include high surcharges on tickets to the airport and expensive parking options. This adds a level of complexity to transportation.\nThis point is often overlooked by policymakers, who often focus on movement between transport hubs, be it airport to airport, port to port or station to station. Instead, the focus should be on mobility.\nSuch terminology means the ability to move by utilizing an integrated network of transportation modes. This involves traditional modes such as buses, bikes and cars, but also newer entrants like app-based ride-hailing services. This links also to the concept of “mobility-as-a-service”, which is a shift away from personal ownership of vehicles to the use of shared mobility solutions as services.\nEfficient and sustainable mobility is essential for the functioning and development of modern cities and regions. It enhances accessibility, reduces congestion, improves productivity, contributes to environmental protection and fosters economic growth. Additionally, mobility options and infrastructure should be designed to be inclusive, ensuring accessibility for people with disabilities and promoting equitable access for all.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nAs the world continues to evolve, mobility is also being influenced by technological advancements, such as autonomous vehicles, ride-hailing services and smart transportation systems. These innovations aim to enhance the efficiency, safety and sustainability of mobility while addressing challenges such as traffic congestion, environmental impact and limited infrastructure capacity.\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get ‘closer to the people’: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Article\nGaruda Indonesia plans to procure 15 to 20 new aircraft in 2025\nLion Air executive appointed as new Garuda Indonesia CEO\nPrabowo to cancel debts of millions of farmers, fishermen: Adviser\nPTDI hopes to develop own jet fighters with roles in KF-21 project, Rafale procurement\nHow to protect local cosmetics products from imports\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get ‘closer to the people’: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nMore in Opinion\nView more\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo’s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?\nAcademia\nStop with the LGBTQ scapegoating\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nAcademia\nNavigating Indonesia-US relations amid global and domestic changes"

(AFP/Giuseppe Cacace)\nI\nn a historic move, the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP28) last month finally made inclusivity the center of discussions related to climate change. For the first time inclusivity has been recognized as a critical enabler to ensure substantial and transformative advancement in tackling the climate agenda within the right time frame; triple renewable energy and double energy efficiency globally by 2030.\nSherry Arnstein's Citizen Participation Model (1969) suggests that the highest inclusivity ladder is when participation transitions into delegated power and citizen control. This means citizens, whether through delegated power structures or citizen control scenarios where community organizations govern programs, hold pivotal cards in shaping policies and managing institutions. Inclusivity fosters true accountability and negotiated decision-making, ensuring that public institutions willingly relinquish some control, decision-making authority or funding to citizens.\nCOP28 strove to achieve inclusivity by convening diverse groups at the forefront of climate change, including women, youth, indigenous peoples and multilevel leaders. This approach has yielded various initiatives that prioritize their interests. However, it is imperative to ensure that these groups not only participate but also meaningfully and substantively engage in COP28 and its aftermath.\nOne of the key initiatives under the Inclusivity pillar is the COP28 Gender-Responsive Just Transitions and Climate Action Partnership, with the aim of promoting women's economic empowerment and achieving a fair gender-responsive transition. This tackles women’s financial challenges and the gender data gap through financial support, education and training that enable women to fully participate in the clean energy sector.\nWith the endorsement of 68 countries, this partnership has led to the establishment of the first-ever Gender Equality Day on Dec. 4, 2023. While ASEAN member states, including Indonesia, have not officially signed the pledge, it is essential to recognize that the collective effort toward this shared ambition is huge.\nGender emerges as a salient factor shaping the vulnerability to and coping mechanisms for climate-induced hazards. Recent findings demonstrate that women who rely on natural resources for sustenance, which often represent their primary income stream, are disproportionately susceptible to climatic uncertainties. In contrast, men exhibit a proclivity toward income source diversification, thereby augmenting their resilience to environmental perturbations.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nAccording to the UN Development Program (UNDP), women also perform over 75 percent of unpaid care work worldwide, 3.2 times more than men.

A shared commitment on Sustainability was echoed during Coldplay’s Music of the Spheres World Tour concert held in Jakarta on November 15, 2023.\nThe collaboration between AIA Indonesia and Coldplay came alive through several shared commitments on Sustainability elements. Just like previous Coldplay Music of the Spheres concerts, the Jakarta concert featured\nreusable LED wristbands\n. Worn by the audience during the show, these wristbands are made from 100 percent compostable, plant-based materials. Post-concert, the wristbands are returned and refurbished by Coldplay for future events, minimizing environmental impact. AIA Vitality - a shared-value program from AIA that motivates behavioral changes among its members to adopt healthy habits - was featured on the wristbands.\nAdditionally,\npower bikes\nand a\nkinetic floor\nwere installed at the concert to generate energy and reduce carbon emission from the performance. Fans could enter the energy zones (passing AIA Vitality’s entrance and exit signs) to actively participate in charging the show's batteries through power bikes, while the kinetic floor also converted the fans' dancing energy into electricity, allowing the audience to help power the show through their dance moves.\nAnother concert highlight was the \"red moment\" during the band’s Humankind song, where all wristbands glowed red, marking the collaboration between AIA Indonesia and Coldplay. &nbsp;Furthermore, a video showcasing Coldplay's sustainability efforts was played directly before the concert.\nSainthan Satyamoorthy, President Director of AIA Indonesia\nstated, “We are proud to have partnered with Coldplay on these sustainability initiatives. AIA Indonesia will also join Coldplay’s reforestation effort in Indonesia supported by OneTreePlanted, Coldplay's official partner for tree planting. We aim to contribute to Indonesia’s environmental health through tree planting in 5 locations in Indonesia.”\nFor those intrigued by Coldplay's commitment to sustainability, the band offers an in-depth look at their global initiatives at\nMusic of the Spheres World Tour: Sustainability (coldplay.com)\n.\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get ‘closer to the people’: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Article\nPolice arrest suspect in Coldplay ticket scam\nPolice investigate alleged scams amid Coldplay ticket chaos\nAIA Indonesia Champions ESG Through  “AIA Healthy for The Nation” Initiative\nJIS can host U-17 World Cup: Jokowi\nSign language interpreters describe their experience with music\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get ‘closer to the people’: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nMore in Front row\nView more\nFront Row\nThink Business, Think Hong Kong: Spotlighting Asia opportunities in Jakarta\nFront Row\nBPJS Kesehatan partners with stakeholders to build a fraud-free JKN ecosystem\nFront Row\nFore Coffee ends the year strong with hopeful prospects and locally focused products\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo’s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?\nAcademia\nStop with the LGBTQ scapegoating\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nAcademia\nNavigating Indonesia-US relations amid global and domestic changes"

The programs kicked off in 2021 and will run through 2025.\nAt least 350 participants took part in the event, including representatives of relevant ministries/institutions, international non-profit&nbsp; organizations, civil society organizations, academics, teachers and students or beneficiaries of the programs. It was held at Bigland Hotel International &amp; Convention Hall, Bogor, West Java, from Nov. 12 to Nov. 14.\nDirector General of Teachers and Education Personnel at the Education, Culture, Research and Technology Nunuk Suryani asserted in a video during the opening of the event, “Places of education must be safe and comfortable places for students to study. Intolerance, sexual violence and bullying must be averted and wiped out.”\nNunuk also expressed appreciation to Rutgers Indonesia for the various endeavors it had made in ensuring children achieve their rights, especially in access to education.\n“Your organizations, your work in the field and personal commitment have driven a change now taking place in Indonesia and this should continue,” said Sophie van Huut, representing the Ambassador of the Netherlands to Indonesia Lambertus Grijns.\n“I have seen energy emulated in civil society, local leaders, students and especially women in their efforts to organize their own groups for better and positive change,” she added.\n“The issue of PKRS rights is now under pressure worldwide. Though it is not visible it is worrying and therefore, it is important to discuss the issues and raise the issues of HKSR to the surface.”\n“We need to bring the issue to the surface, discussing it not only involves women but also men, the youth and students,” she said.\nRutgers Indonesia country director Restu Pratiwi pointed out: “From the entire accomplishments that have been made in the last two years, we have seen support from both local and national government for the programs, which is an essential element of success.”\n“Rutgers Indonesia highly appreciates headmasters and teachers who have taken the initiative to continue to educate our children in relation to PKRS.”\nBy focusing on educating, advocating and engaging the public, including the youth, Rutgers Indonesia, in collaboration with its strategic partners, strives to participate in creating a society that mutually respects and fully upholds the rights of all individuals.\nThe three-day event featured various discussion sessions, addressing issues of health, reproduction, prevention of child marriage and sexual violence, both from the gender and Islamic perspective and on the university campus, online gender-based violence and the role that social media platforms play in driving sexual violence. The films\nAngen\nand\nParalegal Muda\nwere screened and discussed on the first day of the event as a warming up prior to further talks on the issue of child marriage and gender-based violence in the following days.\nIn a talk show themed “Adolescents and youth aspirations and development in education and community systems,” several young champions shared their experiences, challenges and best practices regarding their efforts to take part in promoting the understanding of HKSR among their peers.\nTheir challenges included how to change rural parents’ lingering notions that an adolescent who delays their marriage is considered\ntidak laku\n(unable to find a partner), which often leads to child marriage.\n“’It is unnecessary for girls to pursue an education as they will end up going back to the kitchen’,” a panellist, one of the beneficiaries of the program, quoted a parent that she met, as saying.\n“I tried to convince the girl and her parents that early marriage can increase the risk of sexual and reproductive complications. Besides, early marriage can lead to the female adolescent suffering domestic violence and being deprived of her rights to health, education, safety and participation.”\n“\nAlhamdullilah\n[thank God], the girl and her parents finally became aware of the negative effects of early marriage and agreed to avoid child marriage,” she said enthusiastically.\nBut freeing Indonesia of child marriage apparently remains a tough challenge. Data for 2020 from Statistics Indonesia (BPS), the National Development Planning Agency (Bappenas), UNICEF and PUSKAPA, show 11.21 percent, one in nine young girls aged between 20 and 24 years, get married at 18 years old.\nThe data also showed that West Sulawesi was the province with the highest rate of marriage before 18 at 19.43 percent, followed by Central Kalimantan at 19.13 percent and Southeast Sulawesi at 18.96 percent.\nThe dialog event also saw the participants flock to booths as they were eager to gain information on the profile of the programs now under implementation in 13 regencies.\nThe RHRN2 program enables trained teachers to help young people, including the disabled and other vulnerable and marginal groups, to have fair and non-discriminatory access to education, information and HKSR services in an inclusive way.\nThe targeted youth divided into the categories of age ranging from 12 to 24, at school, university and among the wider public. Beneficiaries of the program included vulnerable groups and other marginal groups ranging from 18 to 35 from Langkat, North Sumatra; Indramayu, West Java; Jombang, East Java; and Greater Jakarta.\nMeanwhile, the PtY program aims to encourage young girls and female adolescents to have the power to negotiate, voice their rights in public spaces and develop a sense of self-reliance in making decisions for themselves so they can protect themselves from dangerous practices related to PKRS such as child marriage, adolescent pregnancy, female circumcision and other gender-and-sexuality-based violence.\nTo achieve the change in the lives of female adolescents and the youth, the program involves boys and male adults.&nbsp; The PtY program is being implemented in Garut and Cianjur, West Java; Jember and Bondowoso, East Java; and East and Central Lombok in West Nusa Tenggara (NTB).\nRutgers Indonesia also focuses on research activities under the Explore4Action (E4A) program.&nbsp; The research aims to understand developmental growth experiences by adolescents aged between 12 and 24 years, especially relating to PKRS and factors that impact their experiences negatively and positively.\nUnder the program, Rutgers Indonesia, in collaboration with researchers at Gadjah Mada University in Yogyakarta, for example, conducted an in-depth study on the impact of the PKRS module called SETARA, an adapted version of UNESCO’s technical guidance for sexual education for students, among junior high school students in Semarang, Bandar Lampung and Denpasar.\nPKSR was included in biology or other lessons as additional content.\nThe study found that the targeted students improved their knowledge about PKRS rights and changed their attitude toward women. “For example, they no longer view that women should end up returning to the kitchen, which is a positive and encouraging trend,” said Sanyu of Rutgers Indonesia.\n“We will not be able to assess or measure the change in young student behavior until PKRS is included on the national curriculum,” Sanyu added.\nIn the concluding session of the dialog, the participants commended the programs designed and facilitated by Rutgers Indonesia. They not only wanted the programs to be expanded to other regencies and provinces across Indonesia, but also to be retained and continued.\nA participant said that the ongoing PKRS discussions and the campaign about the HKSR ran well thanks largely to the role that Rutgers Indonesia with its team and partners play in safeguarding the programs.\n“I think these should be expanded to other the regencies across Indonesia so that child marriage and sexual violence against women can really be prevented,” said Moh. Musyafik, head of the Jombang Women’s Empowerment and Child Protection’s Regional Technical Implementation Unit (UPTD PPA).\n“Any ideas of change and breakthrough endeavors or programs should be implemented sustainably, instead of temporarily or incidentally and therefore, PKRS should be included into a system as a national strategic issue, like the issue of stunting under Bappenas,” he said.\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get ‘closer to the people’: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Article\nWomen’s reproductive health: Untangling fact from myth\nRepublicans face 2024 dilemma after abortion rights issue powers Democrats\nAbortion rights advocates, Democrats score wins in US elections\nNew health bill a chance to help eradicate sexual violence\nUnintended pregnancies put women’s health and lives at risk\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get ‘closer to the people’: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nMore in Front Row\nView more\nFront Row\nThink Business, Think Hong Kong: Spotlighting Asia opportunities in Jakarta\nFront Row\nBPJS Kesehatan partners with stakeholders to build a fraud-free JKN ecosystem\nFront Row\nFore Coffee ends the year strong with hopeful prospects and locally focused products\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo’s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?\nAcademia\nStop with the LGBTQ scapegoating\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nAcademia\nNavigating Indonesia-US relations amid global and domestic changes"

(Reuters/Sputnik/Alexei Druzhinin)\nT\noday marks the fifth anniversary of the ASEAN-Russia Strategic Partnership. On that day in 2018 the Third ASEAN-Russian Federation Summit elevated our dialogue relations, which was an important milestone in Russia’s three decades-long cooperation with ASEAN, and, more broadly, with the countries of the region.\nThese ties are deeply rooted in history: official contacts and exchanges developed already in the 19\nth\ncentury with the memorable visit of the Crown Prince Nicholas (the future Emperor Nicholas II) to Siam in 1891 being one of them. In the 20\nth\ncentury, the key features of the policy toward the states of Southeast Asia consisted of unconditional support for their pursuit of independence, as well as for their efforts to build statehood, economy and industry.\nThroughout all these years, our commitment to fostering friendship with the peoples of Southeast Asia has been firm and sincere. At present, the platform of our Strategic Partnership has opened new wider opportunities for developing stronger, deeper and mutually beneficial relations and building a peaceful, stable, prosperous and integrated region.\nThis July, foreign ministers of ASEAN member states and Russia, while reviewing the achievements of the ASEAN-Russia Strategic Partnership made over the past five years, noted the significant contribution of the ASEAN-Russia relations to the ASEAN integration and community-building process across the three spheres of political-security, economic and socio-cultural, as well as outlining a comprehensive framework for future cooperation.\nIt covers a wide range of areas, including enhancing regional food security, disaster management, environmental and climate cooperation, energy security and sustainability.\nWe have been successfully working together under the Comprehensive Plan of Action to Implement the ASEAN-Russia Strategic Partnership for 2021-2025. New avenues of collaboration, such as the Consultations of the High Representatives for Security Issues and Dialogue on Information and Communication Technology Security-Related Issues, have become important channels of communication, facilitating cooperation on contemporary security matters.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nIn 2021, we held the first-ever ASEAN-Russia naval exercise. In 2022, the consultations on tourism were elevated to the ministerial level and earlier this year we convened the inaugural ASEAN-Russia Ministerial Meeting on Science, Technology and Innovation.\nSince 2018, Russia has tripled its investment in the region, showcasing the growing economic ties. Collaborative projects in such areas as supply chain resilience, digital economy, sustainable development and creative economy are being carried out. Our country has traditionally been a responsible supplier of agricultural products and fertilizers to Asia.\nGiven the growing energy demand in Southeast Asia, which is estimated to increase by 50 percent by 2050, there is an immense potential for collaboration in this field, including clean energy technologies, nuclear energy and alternative energy sources.\nJust last month the executive director of the ASEAN Centre for Energy participated in the Sixth Russian Energy Week, which provided another opportunity to discuss the transition scenarios in ASEAN and our further cooperation. In August, an education program for ASEAN specialists in energy was launched at the St. Petersburg State Economic University.\nRussia's expertise in digitalization, robotics, quantum technologies and artificial intelligence has been shared with ASEAN partners during the ASEAN-Russia Year of Scientific and Technical Cooperation in 2022, and we are ready to do so in the future. Last October the \"Smart City: Russia-ASEAN Digital Space\" conference in St. Petersburg brought together officials and experts from Russia and ASEAN member states, emphasizing our shared commitment to innovative urban development.\nEducation, tourism, culture and people-to-people contacts remain pivotal areas of our joint work. The number of scholarships for students from Southeast Asia has been increased. Of special relevance for the present brief review is the master’s program “Political Economics of the Russia-ASEAN Strategic Partnership”.\nWe successfully continue to implement various personnel-training projects for ASEAN hosted by MGIMO University in Moscow, nurturing expertise and fostering cultural understanding, including programs for law-enforcement experts, epidemiologists, tour operators and other.\nThe Russian private sector has shown growing interest in Southeast Asia. The Russia-ASEAN Business Council promotes business-to-business contacts with the counterparts from ASEAN member states. To foster them the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of the Russian Federation opened its regional office for Southeast Asia in Jakarta in 2021.\nThe ASEAN-Russia Business Dialogue and the ASEAN- Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU) Business Dialogue are held annually on the sidelines of the Eastern Economic Forum and the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum.\nRussia is actively engaged in the processes of cross-platform cooperation with ASEAN.\nToday is also another important anniversary, five years ago, the memorandum of understanding between ASEAN and the Eurasian Economic Commission was signed. The EAEU is a steadily developing integration organization embracing Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Russia with a joint gross domestic product of more than US$2.5 trillion. It is among the world’s top three producers of oil, gas, fertilizers, wheat and livestock products.\nDeveloping closer economic interaction between ASEAN and the EAEU holds potential for a synergy that can contribute to sustainable development in Asia and provides outstanding opportunities for member states of both organizations. To explore and promote them EAEU Days will be held at the ASEAN Secretariat next week.\nIn the increasingly troubled world of today with multidimensional&nbsp; challenges to the maintenance of peace and security, the value of long-term friendship that has withstood the test of time is of the utmost significance. In an era where collaboration and understanding are paramount, the tapestry of our ties woven through history serves as a testament to the enduring partnership between Russia and ASEAN nations.\nAs we look at the five years of ASEAN-Russia Strategic Partnership, it is evident that the strong foundation laid in the past and the comprehensive framework set for the future reflect our shared commitment to mutual progress and prosperity. Together, we are poised to reach further heights and continue to contribute to the development of our countries.\n***\nThe writer is Russian ambassador to ASEAN.\n&nbsp;\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get ‘closer to the people’: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Article\nMore than one year later, stalled relocation blights Rempang project\nEconomic potential reaches $9.23b from tourists during year-end holidays\nIndia's vinyl revival finds its groove\nPrabowo’s balancing act\nHSBC GTS and TradePay aim to support Indonesia’s thriving digital economy\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get ‘closer to the people’: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nMore in Opinion\nView more\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo’s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?\nAcademia\nStop with the LGBTQ scapegoating\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nAcademia\nNavigating Indonesia-US relations amid global and domestic changes"

(AFP/Mohammed Abed)\nA\nhead of the visit of United States Secretary of State Antony Blinken to Israel last week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made a statement comparing Hamas to terror group Islamic State (IS), only to spark an immediate flurry of heated discussions and renewed global attention.\nThe parallel drawn between the two militant groups was unequivocal, with Netanyahu emphasizing his commitment to treating Hamas just as IS had been dealt with, underscoring their shared classification as terrorist organizations.\nWhile this comparison may not have come as a surprise, given Hamas' long-standing designation as a terrorist group by the US and its allies since 1987, the repercussions of this characterization were far-reaching, stirring up intense discussion about its implications for the global war on terrorism.\nThe aftermath of the tragic 9/11 attacks in the US marked the genesis of the war on terror, a campaign that primarily focused on targeting the al-Qaeda network. President George W. Bush's resolute stance against any government supporting terrorist groups set the stage for significant military interventions in various countries, including Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya and Yemen. This concerted effort to combat terrorism underscored the unwavering commitment of the US and its allies to safeguarding global security.\nHowever, the subsequent shift in the rhetoric during president Barack Obama's tenure and the eventual conclusion of the war on terror in 2013, followed by the symbolic withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan in 2021, marked a significant turning point in the trajectory of global counterterrorism efforts.\nIn light of these historical antecedents, Hamas' recent offensive against Israel has reignited debate about the future trajectory of the global war on terrorism. The international community's response to the ongoing retaliatory strikes between Hamas and Israel has become a focal point of concern, raising questions about whether the events would trigger a renewed commitment to combat terrorism with the same fervor as in the past.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nWith the conflict’s potential escalation jeopardizing the security interests of the US and its allies, the implications of this escalation for global stability have become increasingly pronounced.\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get ‘closer to the people’: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Article\nUS says Israel is acting in Syria for its own defence\nJemaah Islamiyah’s disbandment appears irreversible and real\nGaza 'hell on Earth' for one million children: UN\nChildhood anemia and stunting: Indonesia's silent crisis\nForeign aid can support democratic resilience in a changing Indonesia\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get ‘closer to the people’: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nMore in Opinion\nView more\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo’s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?\nAcademia\nStop with the LGBTQ scapegoating\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nAcademia\nNavigating Indonesia-US relations amid global and domestic changes"

The renewable energy is said to help the gas station operator save 10-15 percent of its monthly electricity bill. (Antara/Aloysuis Jarot Nugroho)\nT\nhis year we pass the halfway mark both on our journey toward implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the 17 Sustainable Development Goals, and the signing of the Paris Agreement on climate change.\nAsian and Pacific countries have seen mixed progress in both. One of the most pressing challenges is the transition to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all, as encapsulated by SDG 7. Without a significant acceleration of effort, reaching SDG 7 and its targets for energy access, renewable energy and energy efficiency will elude our region. Given the significance of Asia and the Pacific in terms of global energy supply and consumption, actions taken here will set the tone for the global trajectory of progress on SDG 7 and the fight against climate change.\nThe United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific will place these issues at center stage during this week’s Asian and Pacific Energy Forum. This meeting will provide a platform for the region’s energy ministers to plan a regional agenda for a sustainable energy transition.\nLooming large among these issues is the lack of access to electricity and clean cooking fuels for hundreds of millions of people. This deprivation has far-reaching consequences, and is a harsh reminder that, while the region has made significant strides in economic development, not everyone has enjoyed the fruits of progress.\nLack of access to electricity hinders healthcare, education and economic opportunities. Moreover, the reliance on traditional cooking fuels such as fuelwood contributes to respiratory diseases that disproportionately affect women and children. Energy poverty exacerbates existing inequalities, trapping communities in a cycle of deprivation.\nTo bridge the energy gap and promote climate-friendly sustainable development, increasing renewable energy and energy efficiency is imperative. The transition to renewables opens avenues for economic growth and job creation. Energy efficiency lowers the need for new supplies, relieves pressures on our energy systems, increases productivity and reduces waste, simultaneously saving money for households and businesses.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nTogether, renewable energy and energy efficiency foster energy security.\nRealizing the SDG 7 targets requires increased financial flows. According to the secretary-general’s global roadmap for accelerated SDG action, annual electricity access investments must increase by US$35 billion and by $25 billion for clean cooking by 2025. A tripling of renewable energy and energy efficiency investment is needed by 2030.\nScaling up finance at this rate requires a large infusion of private finance to bolster insufficient public sources, alongside shifting national budgets away from fossil fuels. Carbon pricing mechanisms can incentivize businesses to transition towards cleaner energy solutions. Innovative business models and financial instruments can attract international finance.\nBut for these to be successful, governments must provide predictable and enabling policy environments.\nTo ensure the stability of the energy transition over the long term, governments must keep an eye on over-the-horizon risks. Key among these is ensuring adequate, stable and predictable supplies of critical raw materials needed to construct the millions of solar panels, wind turbines and batteries of the future.\nOur region holds immense potential for critical raw materials production, making it a key player in the global energy transition. However, regional collaboration is needed alongside responsible mining and extraction practices that minimize environmental damage and social disruptions. Moreover, investing in the recycling of critical raw materials can reduce our consumption of finite resources.\nWhile transitioning towards clean energy is a moral and environmental imperative, a just transition ensures that no one is left behind as countries move away from fossil fuels and towards sustainable resources and technologies. This includes reskilling and reemployment opportunities for workers in declining industries, as well as community support to mitigate the socio-economic impacts of the energy transition.\nAchieving SDG 7 requires a multifaceted approach. This is not a challenge that any one country or sector can solve in isolation; it demands collaboration, innovation and shared responsibility.\nAs we reflect on our progress at this halfway point, it is timely for countries across Asia and the Pacific to recommit to a regional vision where all citizens have access to clean and modern energy and the full potential of renewables and energy efficiency are realized.\nThe momentum behind these changes is growing and the opportunity to close these gaps must be seized.\n***\nThe writer is under-secretary-general of the United Nations and executive secretary of the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific.\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get ‘closer to the people’: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Article\nSyria rebel leader discusses 'transfer of power' after Assad's fall\nReflection on women’s fight for equality in Indonesian politics\nWhy a UN plastics treaty matters for climate change and Indonesia\nIndonesia women's team reaches first-ever AFF Cup final\nAsia's airlines blame supply chain woes for disrupted operations\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get ‘closer to the people’: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nMore in Opinion\nView more\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo’s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?\nAcademia\nStop with the LGBTQ scapegoating\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nAcademia\nNavigating Indonesia-US relations amid global and domestic changes"

The renewable energy is said to help the gas station operator save 10-15 percent of its monthly electricity bill. (Antara/Aloysuis Jarot Nugroho)\nT\nhis year we pass the halfway mark both on our journey toward implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the 17 Sustainable Development Goals, and the signing of the Paris Agreement on climate change.\nAsian and Pacific countries have seen mixed progress in both. One of the most pressing challenges is the transition to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all, as encapsulated by SDG 7. Without a significant acceleration of effort, reaching SDG 7 and its targets for energy access, renewable energy and energy efficiency will elude our region. Given the significance of Asia and the Pacific in terms of global energy supply and consumption, actions taken here will set the tone for the global trajectory of progress on SDG 7 and the fight against climate change.\nThe United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific will place these issues at center stage during this week’s Asian and Pacific Energy Forum. This meeting will provide a platform for the region’s energy ministers to plan a regional agenda for a sustainable energy transition.\nLooming large among these issues is the lack of access to electricity and clean cooking fuels for hundreds of millions of people. This deprivation has far-reaching consequences, and is a harsh reminder that, while the region has made significant strides in economic development, not everyone has enjoyed the fruits of progress.\nLack of access to electricity hinders healthcare, education and economic opportunities. Moreover, the reliance on traditional cooking fuels such as fuelwood contributes to respiratory diseases that disproportionately affect women and children. Energy poverty exacerbates existing inequalities, trapping communities in a cycle of deprivation.\nTo bridge the energy gap and promote climate-friendly sustainable development, increasing renewable energy and energy efficiency is imperative. The transition to renewables opens avenues for economic growth and job creation. Energy efficiency lowers the need for new supplies, relieves pressures on our energy systems, increases productivity and reduces waste, simultaneously saving money for households and businesses.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nTogether, renewable energy and energy efficiency foster energy security.\nRealizing the SDG 7 targets requires increased financial flows. According to the secretary-general’s global roadmap for accelerated SDG action, annual electricity access investments must increase by US$35 billion and by $25 billion for clean cooking by 2025. A tripling of renewable energy and energy efficiency investment is needed by 2030.\nScaling up finance at this rate requires a large infusion of private finance to bolster insufficient public sources, alongside shifting national budgets away from fossil fuels. Carbon pricing mechanisms can incentivize businesses to transition towards cleaner energy solutions. Innovative business models and financial instruments can attract international finance.\nBut for these to be successful, governments must provide predictable and enabling policy environments.\nTo ensure the stability of the energy transition over the long term, governments must keep an eye on over-the-horizon risks. Key among these is ensuring adequate, stable and predictable supplies of critical raw materials needed to construct the millions of solar panels, wind turbines and batteries of the future.\nOur region holds immense potential for critical raw materials production, making it a key player in the global energy transition. However, regional collaboration is needed alongside responsible mining and extraction practices that minimize environmental damage and social disruptions. Moreover, investing in the recycling of critical raw materials can reduce our consumption of finite resources.\nWhile transitioning towards clean energy is a moral and environmental imperative, a just transition ensures that no one is left behind as countries move away from fossil fuels and towards sustainable resources and technologies. This includes reskilling and reemployment opportunities for workers in declining industries, as well as community support to mitigate the socio-economic impacts of the energy transition.\nAchieving SDG 7 requires a multifaceted approach. This is not a challenge that any one country or sector can solve in isolation; it demands collaboration, innovation and shared responsibility.\nAs we reflect on our progress at this halfway point, it is timely for countries across Asia and the Pacific to recommit to a regional vision where all citizens have access to clean and modern energy and the full potential of renewables and energy efficiency are realized.\nThe momentum behind these changes is growing and the opportunity to close these gaps must be seized.\n***\nThe writer is under-secretary-general of the United Nations and executive secretary of the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific.\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get ‘closer to the people’: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Article\nSyria rebel leader discusses 'transfer of power' after Assad's fall\nReflection on women’s fight for equality in Indonesian politics\nWhy a UN plastics treaty matters for climate change and Indonesia\nIndonesia women's team reaches first-ever AFF Cup final\nAsia's airlines blame supply chain woes for disrupted operations\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get ‘closer to the people’: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nMore in Opinion\nView more\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo’s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?\nAcademia\nStop with the LGBTQ scapegoating\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nAcademia\nNavigating Indonesia-US relations amid global and domestic changes"

Indonesia has committed to transitioning to net-zero emissions by 2060. (Reuters/Willy Kurniawan)\nA\ns the largest economy in one of the world’s leading high-growth regions, Indonesia’s economic trajectory continues to attract the global spotlight.\nAt the same time, the country faces complex considerations in carefully balancing the energy trilemma of secure, sustainable, affordable energy to support growth while defining a credible and just energy transition pathway to low-carbon energy.\nIndonesia’s economic growth is energized by industrialization across sectors and increasing commodity exports driven by global demand. As the world’s third-largest coal producer and a major producer of nickel and tin, Indonesia’s next steps could determine a shared global future. Our natural resources will be pivotal in enabling global access to minerals that are key to clean energy and the electrification of global value chains.\nIndonesia’s journey to net zero is vital, but it’s equally imperative that this essential transition follows a just and equitable strategy. Our transformation must balance and distribute social costs and benefits of climate action equally, in a timely and opportunistic manner across the nation, while managing increased energy use from industrialization in an ambitious and developing nation.\nJust and equitable benefits\nIndonesia is already facing the impact of extreme, climate-accelerated weather events. In 2019 and 2021, tropical cyclones damaged power transmission networks, with storm surges flooding coastal power plants and affecting thousands of local households.\nProspects\nEvery Monday\nWith exclusive interviews and in-depth coverage of the region's most pressing business issues, \"Prospects\" is the go-to source for staying ahead of the curve in Indonesia's rapidly evolving business landscape.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nClimate change not only disproportionately impacts the most vulnerable communities, but failure to address the social impacts of climate transition puts them most at risk of losing out – a shortcoming that could derail the climate agenda.\nThe energy transition path defined for Indonesia must also leave no one behind. In delivering this inclusive growth, it is imperative that energy transition plans, incentives and implementation recognize and address some key barriers to success:\nWorkforce transition and labor rights. Balancing job creation, job loss and labor practices within the value chain of transition-related activities. Shifts in workforce upskilling for high-emitting industries to evolve into green industries.\nAccessibility and equity. &nbsp;Ensure distribution of benefits and liabilities from transition activities beyond the workforce, such as affordable energy access, to households from vulnerable socioeconomic backgrounds.\nLand and community rights. Strong and continuous engagement with communities and local indigenous populations at the frontline of large-scale infrastructure projects, particularly vital in areas where natural resources provide current livelihoods.\nNatural resources and planetary boundaries. It is crucial to quantify the consequential impact of deforestation on biodiversity, human health, food security, particularly for inhabitants of degraded or restored land.\nEnabling a just transition\nThe decarbonization of the energy and power sectors is crucial if Indonesia is to realize its energy transition strategy. There is a clear opportunity to accelerate short- and long-term energy transition efforts, leveraging growing momentum pushed by key actors in the energy ecosystem to adopt cleaner technologies, enabled by enhancement to relevant energy policy.\nElectrification of end uses such as transport and home heating will increase significantly as the energy transition progresses, expanding with ownership of appliances, cars, and machines by 2030. Enforcing energy performance standards to enhance energy efficiency, coupled with increased electrification, will help simultaneously lower energy costs and emissions.\nFocus on increased efficiency will enable higher demand-side responses, such as incentives to reduce EV charging during periods of high load demand, enhancing the reliability of the overall electricity system.\nOn the supply side, renewables are envisioned as the backbone of Indonesia’s future power system. Solar PV will be a pivotal technology to scale up and meet this need, given its modular installation and low costs, as well as Indonesia’s rich solar potential. The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that solar PV will be the dominant global generation source in most scenarios by 2050, with an average build rate of over 20 GW per year by 2050 to stay within the maximum 1.5­ degrees Celsius warming scenario. This needs to be accompanied with initiatives to reduce emissions such as retirement and/or ramping down of fossil-fuel-based generation.\nThe ability to dispatch these renewables needs to be enabled through investments in the expansion of Indonesia’s transmission system, integrating renewables into the grid with enhanced system management to balance the renewables build-out. Embedding flexibility into the power system will be vital as variable renewable energy sources progressively contribute greater shares of power generation.\nThe energy transition also represents a remarkable opportunity to attract climate financing and investment for Indonesia.&nbsp; The IEA estimates as much as US$2.4 trillion in investment is needed across Indonesia’s energy system to achieve the 1.5­ degrees&nbsp;scenario, with the power sector accounting for 40 percent&nbsp;of total investment needs.\nDiverse investment instruments – including public funding, concessional loans, commercial loans, or blended finance – will be needed. These will empower an ecosystem to be able to accommodate varying project requirements and risk – ranging from financing large renewable energy projects to grid and infrastructure, from energy efficiency in homes and business to biofuel and EV charging. It is imperative to ensure that financing is available for projects that are seen as commercially attractive, as well as those that have high social impact but are not as commercially attractive. &nbsp;These financing opportunities should enable the transition, while at the same time allowing synergistic opportunities to spur growth through financing from the private sector.\nFurthermore, this needs to be supported by policy enhancements to focus on key energy transition activities, including acceleration of renewable energy development, reducing use of fossil fuel (carbon pricing, early retirement of coal-fired power plants), improvement of the investment climate (including de-risking of high-risk renewable power opportunities), and enabling financing.\nPolicy enhancement, as we know, is a lengthy process, and requires heightened coordination and collaboration across ministries and relevant policy-making bodies. This needs to be backed by strong and integrated long-term energy plans. An actionable implementation road map can also help, not only defining clear directions but also increasing much-needed certainty for investors.&nbsp;&nbsp;\nThe time is now\nDelivering Indonesia’s essential energy transition will require a concerted effort by all energy industry stakeholders – most importantly policymakers, state-owned enterprises, donors and financiers. These players are critical in empowering energy transition opportunities through the acceleration of renewable energy, guiding a just energy transition for Indonesia.\n--&nbsp;This is the fourth article in a series that examines Indonesia's top 10 priorities in achieving the country’s vision of the future.\n***\nYulius Yulius is managing director and senior partner, and Daven Tjandradjaja is associate director at Boston Consulting Group.\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get ‘closer to the people’: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Article\nMegawati supports free meals program, with caveat\nTrump’s second term could deepen Indonesia-China relations\nRI identifies 29 potential nuclear power plant sites\nNo new impetus seen for JETP under Trump\nChallenges and opportunities for renewable energy in Indonesia: APAC insights\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get ‘closer to the people’: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nMore in Business\nView more\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nTech\nMinister says Apple 'losing out' by dragging its feet on $1b investment\nRegulations\nMinistry inks collab with army, police on food security\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo’s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?\nAcademia\nStop with the LGBTQ scapegoating\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nAcademia\nNavigating Indonesia-US relations amid global and domestic changes"

This is the first regional online shopping event held by the bloc, and it provided a platform for ASEAN enterprises, especially micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), to promote their products through e-commerce channels.\nA wide range of electronics, handicrafts and fashion products from ASEAN countries were on display, highlighting the vibrancy of ASEAN businesses and conveying the message that ASEAN is committed to developing cross-border e-commerce.\nOnline shopping, including international online shopping, has long been an integral part of daily life in China. Many ASEAN products, such as coffee and shrimp chips from Indonesia and durian from Thailand, are hot sellers on China's e-commerce platforms.\nThis year, the “Brand and Quality Online Shopping Festival” held by China has created the “ASEAN offerings” activity, which promotes ASEAN’s specialty products on the Chinese market through special online events and live streaming.\nThe digital economy has changed the way people live and represents the future of the global economy. For developing countries, the digital economy is an opportunity to enliven the consumer market, create new growth points, empower industrial transformation and upgrading, give rise to new business models and promote high-quality development.\nChina and ASEAN are both highlands of digital economy development. China is a leader in the digital economy, at the forefront of digital infrastructure, smart cities and digital government resources, as well as several world-class digital enterprises.\nIn 2022, China's digital economy reached 50.2 trillion yuan (US$6.9 trillion), ranking second globally, and the country's online retail sales amounted to 13.79 trillion yuan, ranking first in the world.\nASEAN's digital economy has seen rapid developing in recent years, showing great potential, with the accelerated rollout of digital platforms and digital technologies in many countries, and booming development of industries such as e-commerce, transportation applications and online services. By the end of June 2022, half of the world's 10 fastest-growing countries in terms of online retail sales, including the top three, were ASEAN members. ASEAN is expected to be among the world's top five digital economies by 2025.\nChina and ASEAN are natural partners in digital economy development. The ASEAN market has already attracted some leading Chinese digital enterprises, including e-commerce platforms such as Alibaba, Tencent and Jingdong, mobile payment enterprises such as Ant Group, digital information enterprises such as Huawei and ZTE and some courier and logistics enterprises.\nThese Chinese enterprises have cooperated with partners in ASEAN countries to promote advanced technologies and mature business models within ASEAN, and they have assisted Southeast Asia in building digital economic ecosystems that promote the rapid rise of local digital enterprises such as Shopee, Lazada and Tokopedia, which has greatly driven the development of ASEAN's digital industry and the construction of its digital interconnectivity.\nBecause of geographic proximity, people-to-people affinity, integrated economies and highly complementary industries, China and ASEAN members are highly compatible in terms of digital economy development planning and industrial needs. The digital economy will be a new “blue ocean” in China-ASEAN economic and trade cooperation, creating many opportunities.\nAt the ASEAN-China Special Summit to Commemorate the 30\nth\nanniversary of ASEAN-China Dialogue Relations in 2022, China and ASEAN established a comprehensive strategic partnership, and Chinese President Xi Jinping emphasized that China would expand cooperation in the digital economy with ASEAN.\nSince then, the two sides have been accelerating digital cooperation, gradually improving strategic alignment and speeding up the implementation of the Initiative on Building ASEAN-China Partnership on Digital Economy. More than half of ASEAN member states have signed bilateral e-commerce cooperation memorandums with China and established the \"Silk Road E-commerce\" cooperation mechanism.\nNew chapters on the digital economy that are included in the ongoing negotiations on the Version 3.0 China-ASEAN Free Trade Area, and an initiative on deepening e-commerce cooperation will be published at the upcoming China-ASEAN Leaders’ Summit.\nIn addition, China and the Southeast Asian bloc have utilized platforms such as the China-ASEAN Expo and the China-ASEAN Information Port to vigorously promote cooperation on projects in the fields of digital government, digital enterprises, digital industries and new communications.\nThis year marks the 10\nth\nanniversary of President Xi’s proposal to build a closer China-ASEAN community with a shared future through the Belt and Road Initiative. China will use this as an opportunity to plan for cooperation in areas such as the digital economy with ASEAN and other countries involved in the Belt and Road Initiative.\nThis year, Indonesia, as ASEAN's rotating chair, has adopted the theme \"ASEAN Matters: Epicentrum of Growth\" and chosen digital economy cooperation as one of the priority agendas. At this historic juncture linking past achievements with prospects, China and ASEAN should work together to embrace and promote the new era of the digital economy.\nWe need to further strengthen the synergy of digital development strategies, enhance digital connectivity and build an integrated China-ASEAN digital market. We need to promote an exchange of experience and capacity-building training and improve rulemaking by agreeing on high-level digital rules.\nWe should push for lower tariffs, more efficient customs clearance, more connected payment methods and faster logistics and transportation so that more ordinary people and enterprises can enjoy the benefits of digital economy development.\nNext month, Jakarta will host the bloc’s leaders’ meetings on East Asia cooperation. We are ready to work with ASEAN countries at the meetings to promote fruitful results and push China-ASEAN digital economy cooperation to a new level.\n&nbsp;***\nThe author is Chinese Ambassador to ASEAN.\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get ‘closer to the people’: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Article\nNavigating Indonesia-US relations amid global and domestic changes\nAmerica's tech blind spot\nXi, Biden attend APEC summit, prepare to meet\nExploring the interplay of human, nature and technology at 2024 Singapore Writers Festival\nUN biodiversity summit making 'very good progress': Officials\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get ‘closer to the people’: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nMore in Paper\nView more\nOpinion\nAnalysis: Govt adopts mandatory B35 biodiesel program as CPO prices tumble\nBusiness\nGlobal chip crunch stunts Indonesia car sales recovery\nBusiness\nXL profit falls in Q3 as tower sale income dries\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo’s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?\nAcademia\nStop with the LGBTQ scapegoating\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nAcademia\nNavigating Indonesia-US relations amid global and domestic changes"

This provides extra pocket money for them,” said Era.\nEra has taken the diverse batik techniques she has mastered and passed them down to her employees one by one. Even though they started with no batik-making skills, she now trusts her employees with the entire product-making process.\n“They are the ones doing the work too. I teach them one by one until they can do it. We also use eco-print fabrics made from natural materials, created using steam and artistic techniques to extract colors and latex from various plants. They have also mastered this [skill],” Era proudly said.\nEra sees a reflection of herself in these women, reminding her of the time when she started her own business.\nDigging into her own pocket, Era enrolled them in training programs. She mentioned that the training covers various topics, including marketing, entrepreneurship, digitalization and more. She hopes that through this training, their skills will improve, and they will become more independent.\nFor Jakarta residents interested in obtaining exquisite Blora batik motifs, they can visit the PNM booth on the ground floor of Senayan Park.

Among other topics, the country has spotlighted the acceleration of the transformation of early childhood education (PAUD).\nCalling on all member countries to collaborate, Indonesia reminded the region to strengthen its shared commitment to improving children’s education and bring an end to the lag in learning and development in early childhood, which was exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAs part of its commitment to PAUD, the government, through the Education, Culture, Research and Technology Ministry, continues to be consistent in modifying the curriculum to make it more responsive to new challenges, develop more varied learning methods and open opportunities for multi-sector collaboration involving the private sector.\nThe new initiative was explained by the director general for early childhood, elementary and secondary education, Iwan Syahril, in the Early Childhood Education Policy Dialogue in ASEAN or the Southeast Asia Policy Dialogue on Early Childhood Care and Education (SEA PD on ECCE) forum. The forum was held in Jakarta on Tuesday and was attended by education ministers from 11 Southeast Asian countries, ambassadors from Southeast Asian countries to Indonesia and hundreds of delegates.\nIwan said it was necessary to design a curriculum that had resilience in supporting sustainable development, as well as one that taught children about the current global society, gender equality, climate change and inclusive education so as to support the availability of PAUD services that were resilient in facing various challenges in the future.\n“I hope that today's conference will be an opportunity for ASEAN countries to unite various ideas by sharing good practices in the provision of quality early childhood services. Together we can build a better future, starting with a stronger commitment to improving the quality of PAUD services,\" said Iwan, noting that the conference was part of a policy dialogue in Southeast Asia on PAUD.\nThis is Indonesia’s fifth time hosting ASEAN. The country’s previous chairmanship of the bloc was in 2011. This year, the country chose the theme, \"ASEAN Matters: Epicentrum of Growth\", which expresses Indonesia's hope of raising the relevance and role of ASEAN in regional and global progress.\nOn Tuesday, Indonesia, through the education ministry, supported by the ASEAN Secretariat and the Southeast Asian Ministers of Education Organization Center for Early Childhood Care Education and Parenting (SEAMEO CECCEP), welcomed the arrival of 200 participants consisting of education ministers, ambassadors from Southeast Asian countries, as well as hundreds of delegates and speakers at the St. Regis Jakarta for the conference.\nPrior to this discussion, the education ministry also had the pleasure of leading the Group of 20 Working Group on Education, as Indonesia acted as the group’s president in 2022, before handing over the reins to India. Through international forums, the ministry highlighted the Merdeka Belajar (freedom to learn) curriculum, which transforms and strengthens mutual cooperation and commitment in efforts to accelerate the transformation of PAUD and recover from the learning and growth lag after the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, in the spirit of\ngotong royong\n(mutual cooperation), Indonesia reiterates the need for collaboration between all stakeholders in order to ensure success.\nTo tackle the setback that was brought on by the pandemic, the ministry proposed a few solutions, such as the provision and implementation of quality early childhood education that is inclusive through proper planning, monitoring and evaluation.\nThe process of transitioning from PAUD to elementary school, as an important part of the Merdeka Belajar program, is also vital in determining the success of the PAUD transformation and should be done delicately and as easily as possible for the students. Another main focus of particular concern is ensuring the collaboration of the PAUD ecosystem, including schools, local government, teachers, parents and the community.\nIf there is one thing that has always been implemented in ASEAN, it is the cross-country cooperation that has been witnessed by Indonesia and other member countries in the region. Iwan expressed his appreciation to the speakers involved in the plenary and parallel sessions who came, both locally and from other countries, such as New Zealand, Japan, Canada, the Philippines, Brunei Darussalam, Malaysia, Thailand, Laos, Singapore, Cambodia and Vietnam.\nFurthermore, Iwan also expressed his gratitude to the entire committee, consisting of the ASEAN Secretariat, the Directorate of Early Childhood Education, the Directorate General of PDM Ministry of Education and Culture, SEAMEO CECCEP, the TANOTO Foundation and the Asia-Pacific Regional Network for Early Childhood (ARNEC).\n\"I realize that without good cooperation, it would be impossible for us to hold this event. Without the commitment and high enthusiasm of the committee, the first ECCE conference and declaration at the ministerial level in the Southeast Asia region would not have been possible. Therefore, I really appreciate the involvement of all ladies and gentlemen in this conference,\" he said.\nThe education ministry, representing Indonesia, hopes that the participants can make the Regional Consultation Meeting on Declaration on Early Childhood Care and Education forum a part of the PAUD Policy Dialogue in ASEAN a productive space to collaborate with each other in transforming and improving the quality of PAUD services in the Southeast Asian region.\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get ‘closer to the people’: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Article\nAPRIL Group improves children’s health, education access in Riau for Human Rights Day\nGovt develops mechanism to help teachers obtain associate, bachelor's degrees\nChinese guards on the ground in Myanmar could go disastrously wrong\nIndonesia to attend ASEAN ministers’ meeting on Myanmar\nICC’s arrest warrant for Myanmar junta chief is a critical step forward\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get ‘closer to the people’: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nMore in Front Row\nView more\nFront Row\nThink Business, Think Hong Kong: Spotlighting Asia opportunities in Jakarta\nFront Row\nBPJS Kesehatan partners with stakeholders to build a fraud-free JKN ecosystem\nFront Row\nFore Coffee ends the year strong with hopeful prospects and locally focused products\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo’s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?\nAcademia\nStop with the LGBTQ scapegoating\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nAcademia\nNavigating Indonesia-US relations amid global and domestic changes"

As companies strive to minimize their environmental impact and embrace sustainable practices, the demand for qualified sustainability and ESG professionals has skyrocketed.\nAPRIL Group\n, the leading Indonesian pulp and paper producer who managed a forest plantation area based in Pangkalan Kerinci, Riau Province, recognizes the urgency of recruiting sustainability professionals to join and grow together with the company. Since 2019, the PaperOne producer has launched the APRIL Sustainability Professional Readiness (ASPiRE) program, an 18-month accelerated talent development program where trainees are involved in working on APRIL’s current business and sustainability challenges.\nThe ASPiRE program offers a unique and transformative experience, equipping candidates with the necessary knowledge and skills for sustainable development. In line with APRIL's long-term sustainability commitment, APRIL2030, the trainees will have the opportunity to work on areas such as conservation and restoration, community development, R&amp;D, fiber and mill operations, as well as supporting corporate roles such as stakeholder engagement, communications, and ESG reporting.\nThroughout the program, participants will gain insights into APRIL Group's business operations, sustainability commitments, and support in cross-functional business programs. This immersive learning experience not only provides exposure to the industry but also fosters personal and professional growth.\nThe program's benefits are exemplified by two alumni who are now integral members of APRIL Group's Sustainability Department: Ika Citra Marlia and Julmar Carcedo.\nIka Citra Marlia, a member of the first ASPiRE batch, reflects on her three-year journey since completing the program.

Embracing challenges as opportunities for growth and continuous learning, she constantly strives to provide innovative solutions and stay up-to-date with evolving sustainability standards and policies.\n&nbsp;\"I am always challenged to be innovative in providing solutions and to keep abreast of new sustainability standards and policies. Looking back, I can see that the Company has always given me new challenges to take on. I treat these as opportunities to keep growing and never stop learning,” Ika states.\nJulmar Carcedo, an ASPiRE alumnus, was attracted to working at APRIL after witnessing their advanced sustainability practices. With a Bachelor’s in International Relations from Brown University, USA and a Master's in Public Policy from the National University of Singapore, he joined ASPiRE in 2020, marking the beginning of his career as a sustainability professional.\nDuring the 18-month program, Julmar immersed himself in three sustainability projects, including enhancing APRIL’s biodiversity portal and analysing APRIL’s peatland management strategy. Reflecting on the experience, Julmar shared, \"The ASPiRE program went beyond work responsibilities, deepening my understanding of sustainability and the company's culture.\"\nAfter completing the program, Julmar is now placed in APRIL's Human Rights and Gender Equality Program, working to establish human rights due diligence within the organization. His highlight was facilitating APRIL’s first human rights impact assessment, stating , \"It broadened my knowledge and fulfilled my goal of making a positive impact&nbsp; on people's lives.\"\nJulmar views his work in APRIL as part of his broader purpose to address societal challenges, such as empowering women in the forestry industry and safeguarding workers’ rights in our supply chain.\nNew Edition of ASPiRE is Calling\nASPiRE is now calling for the fifth edition of the program, presenting exciting opportunities for recent graduates passionate about sustainability. Upon completion of the 18-month ASPiRE program, candidates will have the opportunity to be placed in various sustainability positions within APRIL Group.

From their perspective, the Netherlands only agreed to withdraw from Indonesia after winning a huge ransom payment from their former colony on Dec. 7, 1949.&nbsp;\nTwo days before starting their week-long goodwill visit to Indonesia, Emperor Naruhito said he regretted the suffering of Indonesians under the rule of the Japanese military back in the early 1940s.

The Dutch colonized the archipelago for 350 years until 1942 when they surrendered their colony to Japanese imperial forces.\nAfter the World War defeat in 1945, about 3,000 Japanese soldiers helped Indonesia fight the Dutch, who received support from the Allied forces. Dozens of Japanese soldiers were buried at the Kalibata Heroes Cemetery in South Jakarta.\nThe independence struggle ended at the Round Table Conference in The Hague in 1949, which resulted in the Dutch “transfer of sovereignty” to the United States of Indonesia (RIS). In exchange, Indonesia had to pay 4.5 billion guilders of Dutch East Indies government debt. At today's currency rate, it would amount to US$13.9 billion.\nOriginally, The Hague had demanded 6.5 billion guilders. Isn't it ridiculous? A former colonial master received reparations from a nation it had exploited and oppressed for 350 years.\nIn a parliamentary meeting last week, Rutte said Amsterdam \"completely and unconditionally\" acknowledged 1945 as the year marking Jakarta's independence, adding that he would soon consult with President Joko \"Jokowi\" Widodo to mull on a shared understanding on the past event.\n\"We fully acknowledge Aug. 17 without reservations. [...] We see the [1945] proclamation as a historical fact,\" said Rutte. But he quickly made a disclaimer, insisting that his statement would not \"change any existing legal grounds.\" We call it a Dutch treat!\nPresident Jokowi only gave a normative response to Rutte’s remarks. \"Yes, this [statement] is good, but we will respond to it later. I would like to first ask for input from the foreign minister since the statement has a far-reaching impact,\" Jokowi said.\nJokowi simply nodded his head when visiting Dutch King Willem-Alexander said his country recognized Indonesia's version of Independence Day, in March 2020. The President smiled when the King apologized for the atrocities \"especially those who fell during the Indonesian War of Independence [1945 to 1949]\". How about the gross human rights violations the Dutch committed in the archipelago for 350 years?\nThe King's grandmother, Queen Juliana, and grandfather, Prince Bernhard, surprisingly received a warm welcome from a huge crowd when visiting Indonesia in 1971. She pretended she did not know Indonesia was an independent state.&nbsp;\nWhen Indonesia celebrated its 50\nth\nanniversary of independence in 1995, the King's mother, Queen Beatrix, intentionally came to Jakarta four days after Independence Day, on Aug. 21. In her speech, she said: \"Several days ago [...] Indonesia commemorated the independence proclamation announced 50 years ago on Aug. 17, 1945 [...] Since then, Aug. 17 has become your national day.”\nJapan occupied Indonesia only for over three years, but their cruelty and brutality was no less horrifying than that of the Dutch. Japan and Indonesia signed a peace treaty in 1958. At that time, Tokyo agreed to pay war reparations worth more than 80 billion yen or $223 million. This year, the two countries commemorate their 65\nth\nanniversary of diplomatic relations.\nThe Dutch were very smart and proactive (aggressive) when they were the victims. In March 1956, the government of Japan \"tendered the amount of 10 million dollars 'voluntarily' to the government of the Netherlands to express sincere remorse and regret for the irreparable pain suffered by the Dutch.\"\nIn 1963, West Germany paid 280 million German marks to the Netherlands as war reparation for the people's suffering caused by the Germans during World War II.\nThe Dutch did not do the same to Indonesians who fell victims to their atrocities. The Dutch paid compensation to families of victims of a massacre the Dutch troops committed in Rawagede village in Karawang, West Java, in 1947 only after a court battle.\nFor me, the reluctance to wholeheartedly acknowledge Aug. 17, 1945 as the Independence Day of Indonesia only shows how difficult it is for the Dutch to come to terms with the past. Some of them may find it so hard to see Indonesia, their former colony, progress so much that they campaign against Indonesia’s palm oil industry as the number one threat to the world’s environment.\nHow about Japan? The world's third-largest economy will remain one of our strategic partners in various fields, ranging from economy and trade to the advancement of democracy.\n&nbsp;***\nThe writer is a senior editor at\nThe Jakarta Post.\n&nbsp;\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get ‘closer to the people’: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Article\nA new journey in China-Indonesia relationship: Building a shared future\nThe triple strategic master strokes of Anwar\nNATO allies select Netherlands' Rutte&nbsp;as next secretary general\nCriminalization of disinformation threatens freedom of expression\nDutch vote in tight election with far right set for gains\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get ‘closer to the people’: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nMore in Opinion\nView more\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo’s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?\nAcademia\nStop with the LGBTQ scapegoating\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nAcademia\nNavigating Indonesia-US relations amid global and domestic changes"

But the community is coming under particular pressure during public events, including those associated with Pride, they noted.\nThe surge in online disinformation and vitriol is all the more worrying after a spate of violence during Pride events last summer in Europe.&nbsp; &nbsp;\nOne social media post in Polish falsely stating that the army would create \"LGBT units\" was shared across Telegram, Twitter and Facebook in Serbia.\nThat prompted some users to comment that the new soldiers should be \"burned at the stake,\" while others praised Hitler's persecution of gay men.\nAnother false claim, that the Arc de Triomphe in Paris had been turned into a rainbow art installation, went viral in multiple European languages. Facebook users responded with slurs, one person calling for LGBTQ people to be burned and executed.\nIn Hungary, where government and pro-government media personalities often use anti-LGBTQ rhetoric, Pride celebrations were referred to online using derogatory, homophobic slurs.\nOnline, some posts smeared the LGBTQ community with claims of child abuse.\nClaims that the community was a danger to society were also widespread.\nPosts in Finnish and Croatian either missed or deliberately ignored the satirical nature of a book for adults by a Canadian comedian, Brad Gosse, falsely claiming it was \"promoting sex to children\" as part of a trans-rights campaign.\n\"If you think these are actually kids' books, you shouldn't be allowed to vote,\" he quipped on Twitter.\nThe wave of false claims and hate speech is part of an increasingly violent public discourse against LGBTQ people, say campaigners.\nSome European countries, such as Spain, Slovenia and Moldova, have adopted new legislation protecting LGBTQ rights.\nBut a recent report by the Brussels-based ILGA-Europe (International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association) found that \"the public discourse is becoming more polarized and violent, particularly against trans people.\"\nA May 2023 European Digital Media Observatory (EDMO) report said anti-LGBTQ misinformation and disinformation was particularly prolific and \"often incites hate against minorities, laws and institutions.\"\n'The same tune'\nWhile some anti-LGBTQ false claims shared on social media in Europe in June first appeared in the United States, others originated in Russia.\nAFP fact-checkers found that the video claiming to show Polish public television reporting that the country's army would open \"LGBT units\" was first shared on Russian propaganda channels in January.\n\"Russia and the US far-right are playing the same tune,\" Jakob Svensson, a professor of media and communication science at Malmo University, told AFP.\nSvensson's research highlights a synergy between global actors framing progressive laws or the simple visibility of the LGBTQ community as an attack on \"traditional values.\"\nSuch disinformation campaigns feed into European narratives: false claims about trans athletes filtered from social media in the US to Europe in 2023, where a far-right politician spread them further.\nResearchers and campaigners say a lack of sufficient moderation on social media platforms exacerbates the problem.\nAleksandra Gavrilovic, program coordinator for the Serbian NGO for lesbian human rights Labris, fears young people are particularly exposed to \"content that is neither verified nor accurate.\"\nThe lack of consequences for those spreading false claims and hate speech \"can also embolden anti-LGBTQ activists and bashers who feel impunity to attack,\" Svensson added. &nbsp;\n'Hate campaigners and troll farms'\nThe spike in anti-LGBTQ rhetoric around Pride events in Europe is part of a global trend.\nSome US Pride celebrations have been scaled back this year, organizers told AFP, especially in states where politicians want to curtail rights, as false claims linking the community to pedophilia and satanism have amassed across social media platforms.\nThe surge in disinformation and hate speech around Pride comes as campaigners highlight how physical attacks against LGBTQ people are rising generally in Europe.\nILGA-Europe said Europe and Central Asia had seen the \"deadliest rise\" in attacks in a decade in 2022 when it announced its annual review, a compilation of incident reports from 54 countries.\nOslo's yearly Pride parade was canceled last year following a fatal shooting at LGBTQ venues. Bratislava was rocked by a similar attack in front of an LGBTQ bar.\nMilos Kovacevic, legal empowerment coordinator for Serbia-based NGO Da Se Zna!, told AFP how physical attacks had surged alongside anti-LGBTQ claims online around EuroPride in Belgrade in September 2022.\n\"Half of the incidents we registered in 2022 happened in August and September,\" he said.\nThe leap from online slurs to real-life danger is at the forefront of campaigners' minds.\nRemy Bonny, executive director of EU-wide LGBTQ advocacy group Forbidden Colours, told AFP how he was targeted online by \"hate campaigners and troll farms\" earlier this year for trying to convince EU members to join a lawsuit against anti-LGBTQ laws in Hungary.\nThe director of Hungary's government-backed Center for Fundamental Rights tweeted that Bonny would not be allowed \"near Hungarian children.\"\nAFP found dozens of tweets in English from Twitter accounts with Hungarian usernames calling Bonny and LGBTQ people sexual predators.\n\"Everybody knows how dangerous it can be to publicly call someone a 'groomer' or 'pedophile' without any evidence,\" Bonny told AFP.\n\"This jeopardizes my personal security.\"\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get ‘closer to the people’: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Article\nNorthvolt crisis may be make or break for Europe's EV battery ambitions\nPutin says supports Kamala Harris in US election\nElon Musk's misleading election posts viewed 1.2 billion times: study\nStarmer warns social media firms after Southport misinformation fuels UK riots\nWhen Facebook blocks news, studies show the political risks that follow\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get ‘closer to the people’: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nMore in Paper\nView more\nOpinion\nAnalysis: Govt adopts mandatory B35 biodiesel program as CPO prices tumble\nBusiness\nGlobal chip crunch stunts Indonesia car sales recovery\nBusiness\nXL profit falls in Q3 as tower sale income dries\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo’s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?\nAcademia\nStop with the LGBTQ scapegoating\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nAcademia\nNavigating Indonesia-US relations amid global and domestic changes"

(Antara/Galih Pradipta)\nIn 2015, world leaders committed to providing health services for all people by 2030. In 2023, the world is only halfway toward meeting the target set by the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of achieving universal health coverage by 2030.\nMore effort, from implementation to investment in health, is needed to meet this globally agreed goal.\nConsider some figures.\nBefore the COVID-19 pandemic, the World Health Organization estimated that low- and middle-income countries needed to increase their health spending significantly to reach the health-related SDGs, with an additional US$371 billion annually combined required by 2030. This funding would allow populations to access health services, contribute to building new facilities and train and place health workers where they need to be.\nLately, however, a host of additional factors are increasing the need for additional funding to achieve universal health coverage, such as disruptions to health services caused by conflict, climate change and economic instability.\nIt has also been estimated that preparing for future pandemics will require massive investment in the order of US$31.1 billion annually, with approximately one-third required from international financing.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nTemporary increases in government spending driven up by the pandemic response contributed to a rise in global health spending in the neighborhood of $9 trillion in 2020. That is nearly 11 percent of gross domestic product. Public spending accounted for about 63 percent of this amount.\nWhile public spending will remain the main source of health funding, it will be difficult for countries to find the funds required to meet the ambitious goal of universal health coverage. At the same time, the world economy is under strain, as are national budgets. Development assistance will also likely feel the squeeze. Health services need new sources of funding, and innovative products that can help marshal the resources of the private sector.\nThe challenge is enormous. Individual countries cannot solve the healthcare conundrum on their own. We need global solidarity and collective efforts.\nFor this reason, the African Development Bank, the European Investment Bank (EIB), the Islamic Development Bank and the World Health Organization (WHO) are launching a new investment platform to mobilize more impactful and coherent investments in primary health care (PHC) systems in individual countries and to improve countries’ resilience. We are also channeling resources from other partners, such as the European Commission, to remove the risk from these investments and to make the conditions highly attractive for beneficiary countries.\nAs this is a global challenge, the Inter-American Development Bank, the leading source of development finance for Latin America and the Caribbean, is also considering joining this partnership in view of extending this initiative to the region.\nWhy focus on primary health care? Around 90 percent of essential health services can be delivered through quality primary health care that is closer to communities, via health professionals, doctors and nurses, in local clinics to promote health and prevent diseases. This will avert the need for more costly secondary and tertiary services. Essentially, primary health care reaches even the most rural and remote locations, and also serves as the \"eyes and ears\" of a country’s health system.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and resulting economic crisis taught us that investing in health services that can reach all is central to national security, development and prosperity. It also reminded us that solidarity and equity are integral parts of any health service solution. Cooperation between multilateral organizations and development banks is key to addressing these challenges.&nbsp;\nThis kind of cooperation proved fruitful during the pandemic. The WHO, the EIB and the European Commission worked closely with Angola, Ethiopia, the occupied Palestinian territory, and Rwanda to strengthen their health systems. Initiated as stand-alone programs, in the case of Ethiopia or Palestine, or as part of the response to COVID-19 in Angola and Rwanda, these interventions mobilized technical assistance, grants, and investments with advantageous terms to bulk up primary health care.\nFor example, in Rwanda, WHO is directly advising the government on rebuilding the country’s National Health Laboratory, with financing from the European Commission and the EIB. The new laboratory, connecting to lab services at primary healthcare levels, will be able to perform more than 80 000 free-of-charge tests or analyses each year, serving more than 12 million people in the country.\nOur cooperation will help guide investments by national governments to strengthen primary health care and their overall health systems. It will increase universal health coverage and improve their ability to prepare for, prevent and respond to health emergencies. We will work with countries individually to identify gaps in national health systems. We will support them as they design interventions and investment strategies, find funding, implement projects, and monitor their impact.\nWe will focus on driving measurable impact on people’s health outcomes by using innovative finance mechanisms to spur domestic funding and contribute to promoting our shared goal of health for all, without pushing countries into unsustainable debt.\nWe will launch this new investment platform in Paris at the Summit on a New Global Financing Pact (June 22-23), with a call to generate needed finances to fight inequalities in health and other fields, to finance the climate transition, and to accelerate progress on the SDGs.\nGood health and well-being are common goals that the whole world shares.\nTo achieve such goals, however, countries and institutions must work together. As we strengthen our collaboration, we are convinced that cooperation – between nations, as well as between governments and the private sector – is critical to achieving universal health coverage.\nWe call on our partners to join this global investment platform.\n&nbsp;***\nTedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus is director-general of the World Health Organization.

(AFP/Munir Uz-zaman)\nDesigned to last\nThe challenge for Bangladesh is that different areas are vulnerable to different climate threats, meaning there is no one-size-fits-all approach to housing adaptation, said Shuchita Sharmin, a professor of development studies at the University of Dhaka.\nHomes in the north and center of the country are at risk of floods and river erosion, while those in the south are also exposed to rising salt levels in the water and tropical storms.\nIn the northern district of Gaibandha, where sandbar islands are affected by surging floodwaters during the monsoon season, architecture firm URBANA has developed a model solution of creating raised settlements, said cofounder Kashef Chowdhury.\n\"In the flood zone, it would be futile to elevate single homesteads over wooden or metal foundations, as floodwaters would create whirlpools around the foundations and pull those apart,\" said Chowdhury, whose company focuses on architecture tailored to the country's changing climate and weather.\nChowdhury said he had consulted with locals to find solutions for the whole community and had created elevated areas around a manmade body of water - which keeps the raised houses safe from flooding while providing safe access to rainwater.\n\"Because we are poor, we need the best solution,\" he said. \"A low budget pushes us to think. We cannot just go for the [most] available but costly designs. We instead have to come up with effective solutions that are affordable for our economy.\"\nYet not all climate-resilient architecture projects have proved a success in Bangladesh, several experts pointed out.\nFor example, in the Savar region – near the capital, Dhaka – a floating school was built in 2015 on floodplains with local materials like bamboo, tires and drums so the entire structure could float above water during floods and operate year-round.\nThe school was developed by the Maleka Welfare Trust, a private foundation, at the cost of $50,000, and won the prestigious Aga Khan Architecture Award in 2019.\nYet during a visit to the South Kanarchor village in Savar last month, the Thomson Reuters Foundation discovered that the floating school was gone, with residents saying it had been shut down last year.\nAbdul Barek, a resident of the riverside village, said the biodegradable materials like bamboo rotted away as water levels crept up and that the structure was ultimately pulled down.\nLocal solutions, next steps\nIn some parts of Bangladesh, like the central district of Munshiganj, indigenous building techniques have long enabled locals to adapt to changing weather patterns and water levels.\nIndigenous wooden houses built in Munshiganj can last for up to 80 years, as they are built on raised platforms to keep them above floodwaters, and when river erosion becomes an issue, the homes can be packed up and reassembled somewhere safer inland.\nLocal housebuilder Faysal Rahman said the designs of such indigenous homes had improved over the years, from the use of imported wood to metallic joints to make them more robust.\nYet there are still concerns over the safety of traditional houses – few use fire-resistant paint – and their impact on deforestation as Bangladesh does not have a system for tracing and certifying the origins of timber, according to Rahman.\n\"We need to improve upon our business model and technology to make it more sustainable,\" he said, urging the government to support the indigenous model of \"climate-resilient housing\".\nAid experts and architects, from Jahan of BRAC to URBANA's Chowdhury, said they had shared designs for their climate-proof projects with the government, but they had yet to be taken up.\n\"It is [...] important to translate the local and academic knowledge into policies of the government, but there is still a disconnect,\" said Ahmed of BUET, who is also the president of the Institute of Architects Bangladesh, an industry association.\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get ‘closer to the people’: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Article\nHow China misses great chances to prove its great status\nThe long walk for water in the parched Colombian Amazon\nThe triple strategic master strokes of Anwar\nLike Soeharto, like Hasina\nBangladesh student leader Nahid Islam wants ousted PM Hasina to face trial\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get ‘closer to the people’: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nMore in Paper\nView more\nOpinion\nAnalysis: Govt adopts mandatory B35 biodiesel program as CPO prices tumble\nBusiness\nGlobal chip crunch stunts Indonesia car sales recovery\nBusiness\nXL profit falls in Q3 as tower sale income dries\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo’s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?\nAcademia\nStop with the LGBTQ scapegoating\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nAcademia\nNavigating Indonesia-US relations amid global and domestic changes"

Therefore, today’s children must be equipped with sufficient information and understanding of programming.\nIn response to this need, Koding Next Indonesia, the largest coding school in Southeast Asia, through its CSR program, recently held its second National Children's Coding Competition under the title \"Code the Ocean\".\nThe competition challenged elementary and middle school students in Indonesia to learn about future technology by creating simple games using coding. Coding can sharpen soft skills such as problem-solving and logical thinking to produce digital work. The competition event was held in a hybrid format in several locations, including Jakarta, South Tangerang, Bandung, Surabaya, Medan, Denpasar, Samarinda and online. The event was also supported by the National Achievement Center of the Education, Culture, Research and Technology Ministry.\nWith the title \"Code The Ocean\", Koding Next invited children to understand and support the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) on marine conservation to raise awareness about environmental conditions.\nThe registration process was conducted online and free of charge. Registration was open from February to May 2023. Nearly 2,000 participants attended from across Indonesia. Of those participants, 100 were selected to advance to the semifinals, and from that group, 10 finalists were selected, representing each competition location.\nThe young coders competed in one or both of two categories: Visual Block Coding for ages 8-12 and Text-Based Coding for children aged 12-16. Nadila Dinda Pratiwi, chair of the Code The Ocean 2023 Committee, explained that the event aimed to help children discover their interests and talents in coding from an early age.\nThere were several indicators to evaluate the competition, including the functionality and tidiness of the programming, the delivery of materials related to marine issues, ideas and creativity, as well as mastery of the subject matter and confidence during presentations.\nThis year, the first-place winners in each category received an educational trip to Singapore, with the second-place winners receiving a gaming laptop, while the third-place winners took home a learning laptop with gaming specifications.\nOne of the parents of a participant from Sidoarjo, Ratih, revealed the reasons for including her child in the Code the Ocean Koding Next Indonesia event.\n\"This event serves as a benchmark for children's abilities, and the hope is that they can improve their competence in the field of programming,\" said Ratih.\nThis sentiment was also shared by Berman, who as a parent expressed his hope that the event would be held annually.\n\"Hopefully, this event can be held every year to enhance the experience of participants who are interested in the programming industry,\" said Berman.\nDavin, the winner of the text-based coding category from Malang, SMPN 1 Karangploso, also welcomed this event.\n\"I am very happy and proud at the same time, and I hope to be more active and beneficial for Indonesia. In the future, I also hope that competition events like this will become more exciting and lively,\" said Davin.\nInterestingly, another winner of the visual block programming and text-based programming categories in this competition was Andini, a female student from Binus Serpong. This demonstrates that women also have equal opportunities and competencies in the world of technology.\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get ‘closer to the people’: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Article\nPNM opens learning space for children with disabilities to promote an inclusive future\nRegulatory loopholes in tobacco promotion on social media\nSecuring digital technology for quantum future\nFlypaper effects: The overlooked cost of free meals program\nWe adults are the problem\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get ‘closer to the people’: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nMore in Front Row\nView more\nFront Row\nThink Business, Think Hong Kong: Spotlighting Asia opportunities in Jakarta\nFront Row\nBPJS Kesehatan partners with stakeholders to build a fraud-free JKN ecosystem\nFront Row\nFore Coffee ends the year strong with hopeful prospects and locally focused products\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo’s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?\nAcademia\nStop with the LGBTQ scapegoating\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nAcademia\nNavigating Indonesia-US relations amid global and domestic changes"

(Antara/KCIC)\nC\nhina on Tuesday unveiled its blueprint for a better world, raised by President Xi Jinping in 2013, through a policy paper on building a global community of shared future.\nChina also said it will continue to push for green development in Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) projects, rejecting accusations that it has outsourced its environmental pollution, a senior official from China’s top economic planner said at a press conference on the wide-ranging policy paper about China’s global vision.\nThe White Paper titled “A Global Community of Shared Future: China’s Proposals and Actions” comes a decade after the vision was first proposed by Xi, and has been presented as his alternative to the current Western-led world order, with an emphasis on what it calls Chinese-style diplomacy and various global initiatives.\nThis year also marks the 10th anniversary of the BRI, and China will host the third Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation in October, with leaders and representatives from some 130 countries set to attend, including Russian President Vladimir Putin.\nBy July 2023, more than three-quarters of countries in the world and over 30 international organizations had signed agreements on Belt and Road cooperation with China, the White Paper said.\nIssued by the State Council Information Office, the White Paper said the vision rises above the exclusive rules of bloc politics, the notion of “might makes right” and the “universal values” defined by a handful of Western countries.\nChina has contributed to building a global community of shared future with actions including promoting high-quality Belt and Road cooperation, state news agency Xinhua said on Tuesday.\nAt the press conference, in a rare appearance beyond his usual annual press conference in March, Foreign Minister Wang Yi said that by putting forward the creative idea, President Xi has shown “the correct path for the world”, building a strong consensus for international cooperation.\nChina has also proposed solutions to major global challenges in fields such as health, climate change and cyber security, Wang added.\nHe said Beijing was willing to play a “constructive” role in the success of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in November in San Francisco, US.\nIt paves the way for a possible meeting between Xi and US President Joe Biden – both presidents last met on the sidelines of the Group of 20 (G20) leaders’ summit in November 2022 in Bali.\nXi did not attend the G20 summit in India earlier this month, missing an opportunity to meet Biden, and prompting the US to say China was “giving up” on the G20 and building an alternative world order.\n“Of course, we and all parties also hope that the United States will realize its responsibilities as a host, show due openness, fairness, tolerance and responsibility, and create better conditions for the smooth holding of the meeting,” Wang said, referring to the APEC&nbsp;summit.\nEarlier on Tuesday, Hong Kong Chief Executive John Lee said he had yet to receive any invitation to the November meeting. It follows US media reports in July that he had been barred from the meetings after being sanctioned by Washington for what it calls his role in cracking down on civil liberties in the Asian financial hub.\nWang repeated a frequent Chinese warning that China opposes “wanton expansion of military alliances” and the squeezing of the security space of other countries.\nBeijing has been critical of Washington’s continued attempts to increase military cooperation in the Indo-Pacific region, including the Quad and the AUKUS&nbsp;groupings. It particularly disagrees with bases that are being built by the US in the north of the Philippines.\nDialogue between China and the US has been gradually resuming despite continued tensions, with several high-level visits to Beijing in recent months by top US officials, including Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo.\nMeanwhile, not all is rosy with China’s BRI, which has come under widespread criticism for causing environmental destruction in project areas, including building coal-fired power plants overseas despite a national commitment domestically to reach peak carbon output by 2030, and to be carbon-neutral by 2060.\nEarlier this year,\na report\nin\nThe Jakarta Post\nsaid the Batang Toru hydropower project, which is 70 percent owned by Chinese-owned State Development and Investment Corporation’s subsidiary SDIC Power, encroached on the habitat of the endangered Tapanuli orangutan, forcing them to intrude on nearby farms and villages.\nRead also:\nChina’s big firms put reputation at risk in Batang Toru power plant\n“The joint construction of the ‘Belt and Road’ projects are carried out based on the principle of extensive consultation, joint construction and shared benefits,” Cong Liang, deputy director of the National Development and Reform Commission said in response to a question from\nThe Straits Times\nat the press conference.\n“Whether the development is green or not, I think the [partner country]&nbsp;knows best, the local people have the most say, and facts are always more convincing than words.”\nIt is “not worth refuting” the voices that slander the Green Silk Road – an initiative to make BRI projects more ecologically sustainable – and those who attempt to smear and interfere with joint projects will not succeed, he added.\nTouting the success of the BRI, officials said projects such as\nthe high-speed rail between Jakarta and Bandung\n, the Phnom Penh-Sihanoukville Expressway, and the Greek port of Piraeus have increased connectivity, rejuvenating the local economy with jobs and trade.\n“In the next step, the NDRC will work with relevant departments… (and) continue to build high-quality landmark projects, promote ‘small but beautiful’ projects, deepen cooperation in key areas such as infrastructure and people’s livelihood projects to achieve complementary advantages, mutual benefits and win-win results,” Cong said.\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get ‘closer to the people’: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Article\nNavigating Indonesia-US relations amid global and domestic changes\nRussia teams up with BRICS to create AI alliance\nIndonesia must regain credibility as an honest broker\nXi, Biden attend APEC summit, prepare to meet\nPeru's Chancay: China's megaport of entry to South America\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get ‘closer to the people’: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nMore in World\nView more\nEurope\nUS announces new arms aid package for Ukraine worth $500 million\nMiddle East and Africa\nUS says Israel is acting in Syria for its own defence\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia welcomes UNGA resolution on immediate ceasefire in Gaza\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo’s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?\nAcademia\nStop with the LGBTQ scapegoating\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nAcademia\nNavigating Indonesia-US relations amid global and domestic changes"

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky came to the Jeddah meeting and MBS offered to mediate between Kyiv and fellow oil producer Moscow.\nTo be sure Saudi Arabia still depends militarily on the US, which saved it from possible invasion by Saddam Hussein's Iraq in 1990, monitors Iranian military activity in the Gulf and provides Riyadh with most of its weapons.\nStill, with Washington seemingly less engaged in the Middle East and less receptive to Riyadh's anxieties, MBS is pursuing his own regional policy with less apparent deference to the views of his most powerful ally.\n\"This is a strong signal to America that 'we're reshaping and redrawing our relations without you',\" said Abdulaziz al-Sager, chairman of the Gulf Research Center, of the summit.\n\"He is not getting what he wants from the other side,\" Sager added, saying Saudi Arabia's ententes with regional foes were based on Riyadh's approach to regional security.\nDiplomatic offensive\nMBS' position strengthened last year when Western economies turned to Saudi Arabia to help tame an oil market destabilized by the war in Ukraine. It created the opportunity for MBS to launch a diplomatic offensive that included high profile summit appearances.\nThat effort was aided when Washington declared MBS immune from prosecution for Khashoggi's killing despite his being directly implicated in it by US intelligence.\nA visit by US President Joe Biden last July had already demonstrated Riyadh's returning influence: The American leader left empty handed while the prince enjoyed a public display of US commitment to Saudi security.\nThe Saudi pivot away from reliance on the US was meanwhile evident when China mediated this year a settlement between Riyadh and its arch regional foe Iran after years of hostility.\nThe deal was not made from a position of Saudi strength: Iran's allies had come out stronger than those of the kingdom in Iraq, Syria and Lebanon, and held most of the populated territory in Yemen.\nStill, it showed Riyadh was able to cut its losses and work with US rivals and foes to shore up its regional interests such as cooling the Yemen war where Saudi forces have been bogged down since 2015.\nMeanwhile the prince has improved ties with Turkey and ended a boycott of Qatar, a neighbor he considered invading in 2017 according to diplomats and Doha officials.\n\"Over the past three years, the hatchet was buried and relations were repaired,\" said Saudi columnist Abdulrahman Al-Rashed in\nAsharq Al-Awsat\nnewspaper.\nTransactional relationship\nA Gulf official said the new, more directly transactional, relationship with the US had replaced the old oil-for-defense model because of what Riyadh saw as a shakier security umbrella after the Arab revolts of 2011.\nA senior State Department official said the relationship is \"an important eight-decade one that spans generations, across administrations in our own country and across leaders in Saudi Arabia\".\n\"We have multiple interests when it comes to our relationship with Saudi Arabia [...] Our policy and engagement will seek to ensure that our relationship remains sound and able to meet our shared challenges of the future.\"\nRiyadh thought Washington had abandoned old allies during the revolts and might abandon the Al Saud dynasty too. At the same time, it believed the US pursuit of a nuclear deal with Tehran had led Washington to ignore the growing activity around the region of Iranian proxies seen by Riyadh as a threat.\nThat impression has strengthened. A Saudi source close to the ruling inner circle pointed to what he saw as lax enforcement of sanctions on Iran and a drawdown in Syria, where a small US contingent has denied territory to Iran's allies.\n\"I think countries in the region, as a consequence, will do what is best for them,\" he said.\nMeanwhile, Riyadh was annoyed that the US pulled its support for Saudi operations in Yemen, launched after Washington repeatedly urged the kingdom to take responsibility for its own security.\nWithout direct US intervention or support for its own military efforts, Riyadh had little choice but to strike a deal with Iran even if that annoyed Washington, the source said.\n\"This is a consequence of the US action,\" he added.\nEach side has a list of requests that the other is not willing to grant, the Gulf official said.\nHowever, both sides may have little choice but to put aside their grudges.\nThe kingdom may see the US security umbrella as weakened, but still views it as crucial to Saudi defense. Western states have meanwhile remembered that Riyadh's influence in a volatile oil market requires them to banish their qualms and deal with its de facto ruler and future king.\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get ‘closer to the people’: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nActivists call for accountability in a year filled with police brutality\nRelated Article\nBAZNAS distributes Dam Haj meat to Indonesian residents in four regions of Saudi Arabia\nHow Syria rebels' stars aligned for Assad's ouster\nSyrians rejoice as Assad flees, ending brutal reign\nMacron and MBS sign strategic partnership\nIndonesia revives World Cup hopes with 2-0 win over Saudi Arabia\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get ‘closer to the people’: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nActivists call for accountability in a year filled with police brutality\nMore in Paper\nView more\nOpinion\nAnalysis: Govt adopts mandatory B35 biodiesel program as CPO prices tumble\nBusiness\nGlobal chip crunch stunts Indonesia car sales recovery\nBusiness\nXL profit falls in Q3 as tower sale income dries\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo’s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?\nAcademia\nStop with the LGBTQ scapegoating\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nAcademia\nNavigating Indonesia-US relations amid global and domestic changes"

Despite its geographic location in Southeast Asia, the country struggled to get a nod from the 10-country bloc until late 2022, when it was admitted, in principle, as its 11th member.\nThe road map that was agreed last week by all member states at the ASEAN Summit in Labuan Bajo, East Nusa Tenggara, covers Dili’s obligations demanded by group’s three key political security, economy and sociocultural pillars.\nTimor Leste’s economy with a gross domestic product (GDP) of around US$2.45 million in 2022, notably smaller than the other ASEAN member states, had been its biggest stumbling block, though the recent support from ASEAN has given the country the impetus to fulfill its obligations toward growth.\n“We hope that Timor Leste will put in incredible work to accelerate the implementation of the road map and in due time, will become ready to be a full ASEAN member,” Kao said on Monday, as quoted by state news agency Antara.\n“Collectively, ASEAN member states will also give their assistance to increase Timor Leste’s capacity, such that it will fulfill the necessary criteria.”\nIndonesia’s top ASEAN cooperation official, Sidharto Suryodipuro, said last week that the Timor Leste road map, which was finalized in February, contained a list of legal treaties that Dili must accede to.\nSidharto also revealed that the most complicated part of the road map was drafting the economic requirements.\n“It involved many aspects, including trade negotiations that Timor Leste would have to finalize with other ASEAN member states. The road map will help Timor Leste understand [its obligations] and make its own decisions in our development cooperation,” he told a press briefing in Labuan Bajo.\nHe added that Indonesia had “extended various forms of technical cooperation with and for” Dili. This year, it planned to invite some 30 Timorese civil servants to intern at various government ministries that were set to host ASEAN meetings, including the trade and defense ministries.\nIndonesia is the 2023 ASEAN chair.\n“So their foreign ministry officials will be interning at our Foreign Ministry [...],”said Sidharto.\n“This [internship scheme] is being done with the hope that they will not only gain experience, but also see what the legal side of ASEAN looks like.\n“I think it will be very good [for Timorese civil servants] to exchange views with the Indonesian side and the departments with ASEAN cooperation obligations,” he said.\nMeanwhile, Timor Leste Prime Minister José Maria Vasconcelos said in his remarks during the Labuan Bajo summit that the work to fulfill the country’s ASEAN obligations had already begun in its capital Dili.\n“We believe that we are on the right track as shown by recent investment examples, [including] the modernization of the Presidente Nicolau International Airport in Dili and the recent underwater fiber optic cable system to improve the conditions for impending tourists and researchers,” he told ASEAN leaders.\nVasconcelos, widely known as Taur Matan Ruak, also suggested that restoration of hotels and other accommodation venues for future ASEAN events was also on the cards.\n“Timor Leste is firm in fulfilling the international rules, as well as in strengthening ASEAN so that this community remains united and resilient in its core principles, shared values and norms,” he said.\nDespite the size of its economy, in recent years Timor Leste has attracted praise in other aspects of governance, including kudos as the region’s most democratic country.\nSince gaining independence from Indonesia in 1999, Dili rode the waves of Southeast Asia’s golden period of democratization from the early 2000s until the 2010s.\nAnd while many of its neighbors are struggling to protect civil liberties today, Timor Leste has consistently stood apart with its strong democratic values.\nASEAN, which heavily relies on consensus-based decision-making, consists of 10 countries with vastly different political ideologies, from monarchies to military autocracies, and includes both liberal and illiberal democracies.\nAnalysts have noted that granting Timor Leste full membership would likely impact ASEAN’s political composition by giving a leg up to its pro-democracy member states.\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get ‘closer to the people’: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Article\nJapan seeks Indonesia’s help to solve labor crisis\nChinese guards on the ground in Myanmar could go disastrously wrong\nIndonesia to attend ASEAN ministers’ meeting on Myanmar\nICC’s arrest warrant for Myanmar junta chief is a critical step forward\nMalaysia urges Chinese firms to avoid using it to dodge US tariffs\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get ‘closer to the people’: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nMore in Paper\nView more\nOpinion\nAnalysis: Govt adopts mandatory B35 biodiesel program as CPO prices tumble\nBusiness\nGlobal chip crunch stunts Indonesia car sales recovery\nBusiness\nXL profit falls in Q3 as tower sale income dries\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo’s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?\nAcademia\nStop with the LGBTQ scapegoating\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nAcademia\nNavigating Indonesia-US relations amid global and domestic changes"

This began with the ASEAN Charter in 2005, the first ASEAN document that began with “We, the peoples...”\nThe reality on the ground, however, is that ASEAN still has a long way to go to become a truly people-centered community. While Southeast Asian citizens are aware of the existence of ASEAN, and generally do not have a negative attitude toward the organization, many are clueless as to what it is all about.\nI once asked a group of international relations students in a top Indonesian university what they knew about the ASEAN Economic Community, and received no show of hands. I have repeated this exercise many times at other universities with similar results.\nIndeed, the main problem of ASEAN is that many of its parts do not know one another. There are tens of thousands of civil society groups in ASEAN; most of them do not connect with one another.\nMost micro small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) in any ASEAN country do not do business with those in any other regional country. In Indonesia, the largest economy in ASEAN, there are plenty of provinces, regencies and cities that have no trade links with their counterparts in any other ASEAN country.\nAs a rough estimate, I dare say that out of ASEAN’s population of more than 600 million, fewer than 1 percent have some degree of comprehension about ASEAN beyond name recognition.\nThe average Southeast Asian still feels that ASEAN is the business of diplomats and leaders at the top and are happy to leave it at that.\nMeanwhile, the ASEAN Peoples’ Forum/ASEAN Civil Society Conference (ACSC/APF), a movement of civil societies that began in 2005, is still struggling to be heard and to gain relevance. In 2016, the ACSC/APF released a joint statement expressing deep frustration about “ASEAN’s prevailing silence and lack of attention and response to the observations and recommendations raised in all previous ACSC/APF statements”.\nMore recently, just before the 42nd ASEAN Summit this year, the group voiced this lament: “As an institution that claims to be ‘people-centered’ and ‘people-oriented,’ ASEAN has failed to address the concerns of its people, especially those of the most marginalized”.\nAgainst this backdrop, ASEAN leaders need to take a serious look at how they want to proceed with a “people-centered ASEAN” and ask hard questions why their people-to-people relations remain sluggish after all these years.\nAnd today, some 25 years after the ASEAN Charter came into force, it is time to revisit and ascertain the real meaning of “people-centered” ASEAN. Does it mean ASEAN policies must simply benefit the regional peoples but based on a “father-knows-best” approach? Or does it also mean a more open policy environment, which gives adequate space for bottom-up participation by ASEAN peoples?\nThe latter means ASEAN must be willing to engage in constant and meaningful conversations with civil society groups, even though the exercise may sometimes turn uncomfortable.\nASEAN also needs to re-evaluate its structural arrangements with civil societies. Presently, under the ASEAN Charter, the task of working with “civil societies, business sector, academia and other stakeholders” is left in the hands of the ASEAN Foundation. But the reality of the last two decades tells us that the ASEAN Foundation lacks the standing, capacity and resources to effectively perform the role of focal point for civil societies in ASEAN.\nBeyond this, ASEAN must also encourage the proliferation of bottom-up ASEAN-wide independent civil society initiatives. In this regard, mindful of the region’s academic deficit where university research is scarce and many campuses do not have access to high-quality lectures, the Foreign Policy Community of Indonesia (FPCI) has launched an initiative to provide access to online lectures by world-class scholars for students at universities in ASEAN countries plus Timor-Leste. Now 50 campuses in ASEAN have joined in and the target is to expand its coverage to 200 universities in the coming years.\nMost importantly, ASEAN should undertake a serious and sustained campaign to socialize ASEAN to as many layers and segments of the regional population as possible. The ASEAN Socio-Cultural Community should be retooled: its official “Blueprint 2025” contained plenty of references to natural disasters, human rights, biodiversity, livable cities, but oddly no game plan to actually enhance “people-to-people” connections.\nThere should be an intensive effort to expand the number of civil society groups accredited to ASEAN by making sure that the process of qualifying for inclusion is not too cumbersome. It should welcome even those who are critical of the organization’s performance. The present number of “ASEAN entities”, CSOs officially affiliated with ASEAN, which is around 48, is way too small for a regional organization that serves 600 million people.\nASEAN must also launch an ambitious medium-term “Know ASEAN” campaign, to be conducted by the ASEAN Secretariat. This campaign must have a permanent tagline, distinct from the constantly changing tagline adopted by ASEAN’s annually rotating chairs. (The slogan “one vision, one identity, one community” sounds good to diplomats and officials but does not appeal to the general public).\nThe strategy of this campaign must be crafted professionally, based on periodic surveys that measure the deficit in public perception of ASEAN. The cost of this campaign should be borne by ASEAN’s 10 (soon to be 11) member states, with each contributing US$1 million to $5 million a year to the campaign’s budget. If ASEAN governments are serious about achieving a people-centered ASEAN, this should not be too much of a burden.\nThere is more. The Southeast Asia Games should be renamed the “ASEAN Games”. ASEAN Centers should be established in universities and their programs subsidized or funded by the national governments. The ASEAN Secretariat should pursue a dedicated program to connect the millions of ASEAN MSMEs and open their eyes to business opportunities in the region.\nThe bottom line is that there can be no \"ASEAN identity\" unless the regional peoples know the organization well enough, appreciate its relevance to their lives and feel that they have “ownership” of ASEAN.\nAmbassador Barry Desker, a seasoned Singaporean diplomat, struck an urgent note when he said: “Commitment to ASEAN exists only among policy-makers, academics and journalists and those who participate in ASEAN-related activities […] By contrast, for people living in Southeast Asia, the idea of a community with shared values toward a shared destiny remains a wish to be done”.\nHe is right. In the final analysis, the main challenge to the ASEAN Community is not just about preserving ASEAN’s “centrality” in regional affairs; it is also, more importantly, about deepening ASEAN’s credibility in the hearts and minds of its own peoples, meaning the grassroots and civil society in each individual ASEAN country.\nThis is the only way ASEAN can become resilient and thrive in the 21st century.\n***\nThe writer is founder and chairperson of the Foreign Policy Community of Indonesia (FPCI).\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get ‘closer to the people’: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nActivists call for accountability in a year filled with police brutality\nRelated Article\nPolice dismiss, name officer suspect in fatal Semarang shooting\nMinistry prepares trade remedies to brace for imports\nNo such thing as a free lunch?

(AFP/Tang Chhin Sothy)\nE\nurope, once a theatre of internecine wars, now has a robust European Union shaping the common destiny of its people. Although Europe is only a subcontinent of Asia as Arnold Toynbee had observed and as is visible to anyone looking at a map, we still not have a common Asian platform for economic and political cooperation.\nIt is high time Asia had its well mandated regional organization to secure a common Asian future, ending the costly hostilities and political egos. We can have the Asian Union even when the bilateral hostilities, unique to Asia, refuse to go away completely.\nAsia is the only continent where there are live hostilities today: India-Pakistan and South-North Koreas; the conflicts in a few West Asia countries are, however, not openly bilateral. The China-Japan rift is more emotional than anything and could be more readily surmounted through sensible diplomatic endeavors.&nbsp;\nThe congenital rivalry within the two sets of twin sisters – India-Pakistan and South-North Koreas – may take more time to resolve, but would definitely be resolved in mutual interest once the common gains are in view and a once matured, forward looking political leadership is there to steer&nbsp; the respective countries. A pan Asian Union would make peace and economic progress in the region real.\nLook at the history of Europe. Countries have been forming and reforming there for the greater part of its history. Violence was a daily reality in most of the prosperous countries of today. Factional disputes within its imported religion of Christianity – an Asian religion – was good enough for countries of Europe to go to war for a good part of its latter history. And to engender violence within its societies too.\nInternal conflicts and violence within the European boarders drastically reduced with the launch of imperialist onslaughts. They shifted the theatres of war and violence to the rest of the world, turning most of Asia into its victim.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nEurope changed this rule only with the first and second pan European wars, wrongly called world wars, and the second big war devastated the warring imperial countries militarily and economically, to our good fortune, resulting in their departure from the countries they had occupied.\nIf the countries of Europe whose history is rightly be termed savage, could shed their hostility, end wars and eventually give up a large part of their respective national sovereignty to create the powerful EU, cant the countries of Asia unite in our common interest. Incidentally, it is worth noting that the EU was created in 1993, marking 500 years of Colombus’ invasion of what was later called America and the subsequent occupation of the continent. The treaty signing was not held in 1992, the exact year of five centuries, to provide time for the political leaders and diplomats to engage in the Earth Summit process of that year.\nThere are greater reasons for Asia to unite than Europe had. To overcome the entrenched poverty, to build our economies based on our vast resources, to realize the potential of the immense human talent available, to protect the natural environment and more importantly to keep Asia peaceful and free of external interference.\nA collective Asian position on economic issues in the negotiations with the West can end the skewed trade relations and mark an end to the post-colonial exploitation.\nAsia is home to the ancient civilizations of the Arabs, India, China and Persia; it produced all the religions practiced on earth as well as Confucianism. The West has nothing even remotely comparable to the tremendous cultural, ethnic and linguistic diversity of Asia. It has not colonized countries – with the aberration of Japan, but has been victim of all the predatory imperialists of Europe and suffered massive theft of its resources.\nAsia has survived the imperial onslaught, bounced back and chartered its development course that is already yielding remarkable results. And it is time to take it forward by forging political and economic alliance across the region.\nAsia already has two good precedents to build upon: ASEAN in the east and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) in the west. Both these bodies are fairly concrete groupings and have yielded valuable lessons to their respective members in regional collectivity. The acronyms ASEAN and GCC appear on the daily conversations of the peoples of the respective regions.\nThe South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) had a modest start and continues to remain weak. The Shanghai Cooperation Organization is emerging as a strong regional body with its expanded membership that includes Russia, and deepening its agenda progressively.\nAll these experiences can be creatively applied to establish a pan Asian body of 48 countries for political and economic cooperation.\nOne reason why Africa has no wars or self-defeating hostility between countries is, in great measure, the influence of the African Union. When Asia attains that level of maturity the world shall be a better place. The threat of NATO in the region can be avoided and the incongruous Quad can be done away with. Countries can trade among them in a number of currencies of the region and people can travel without visas.\nOur democracies are at different stages of development; however, nearly all are on the trajectory toward maturity. The Asian Union can accelerate the process of deepening democracy across the region as the economic and social dividends of democracy would then become more obvious.&nbsp;\nJapan may not be initially enthusiastic about the Asian Union due to its dependence on the US on foreign policy, but once convinced that the US is actually a dispensable burden and that the Chinese threat is largely imaginary they would want to join too.\nThe statute of the new union could be designed in a way that the reach of its mandate and the coverage of subjects could be incremental, and allowing room for accommodating the differences across countries. Europe’s experience vividly tells us that the neighboring country’s progress and one’s own is inextricably linked, which should be a compelling reason to shed hostility and envy toward the neighbors.\nThe government leaders, given to conventional thinking, may take a long time to address the goal of an Asian union. It would be the role of the civil society, political movements and the progressive media to take this up on their agenda and build a people’s movement to create the Asian Union.\n&nbsp;***\nThe writer is an international environmental policy specialist and a United Nations environmental negotiator\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get ‘closer to the people’: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Article\n2024 will be the hottest year on record, EU scientists say\nBali as a ‘living mystery school’\nUnderstanding Trump in the MAGA 2.0\nEast Asia, ASEAN and Pacific demand Prabowo’s attention\nTime for ASEAN to have an easy-to-implement geostrategy\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get ‘closer to the people’: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nMore in Opinion\nView more\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo’s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?\nAcademia\nStop with the LGBTQ scapegoating\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nAcademia\nNavigating Indonesia-US relations amid global and domestic changes"

The war is happening right as simultaneously, Indonesia is at the helm of the Group of 20. It is Indonesia’s destiny to navigate the complex situation as it holds presidency of the world’s most prestigious mechanism on economics and finance.\nHistorically, Indonesia has been successful in hosting and chairing many prestigious international meetings, such as the Asia-Africa Conference in Bandung, West Java; the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Bogor, West Java; Bali’s climate conference; and numerous ASEAN’s landmark agreements contributing to regional peace, stability and prosperity, including the launch of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), the world’s largest trade agreement, when chairing ASEAN in 2011.\nThese events highlight Indonesia’s leadership and consistency in implementing its foreign policy, which aims to contribute to world peace, security, friendship and partnership.\nThe G20 was established as the world’s primary inclusive global economic and financial platform bringing together all parties from developed and new emerging economies with their diverse views to deliberate and adopt global policy measures. As a trillion dollar economy and the world’s 16\nth\nlargest, and as a country that emerged from the devastating 1998 financial crisis with the prestigious status as the world’s third largest democracy, Indonesia’s membership comes with responsibilities.\nReeling from the Asian financial crisis, Indonesia recovered stronger and envisions becoming the world’s seventh largest economy by 2030 while promoting democracy, human rights, sustainable development and multilateralism.\nThe theme of Indonesia’s G20 presidency, “Recover together, recover stronger”, represents the country’s responsibility to embrace all in its bid to bounce back from the pandemic. It adopts three concrete, deliverable priorities, which are not only in Indonesia’s interests, but are common global priorities: health, energy transition and digital transformation. The theme clearly represents the leadership’s aim of ensuring the G20’s relevance for everyone -- north and south, rich and poor.\nThe first priority underscores the fact that the pandemic has taught us all crucial lessons in how unprepared we are -- whether developing or developed countries -- and how divisive the narratives when unity is urgently needed.\nThe pandemic and geopolitical tension formed a perfect storm when distrust grew and unity was absent. Divisive rhetoric and exchanges of accusations were the dominant narratives, instead of collaboration.\nGalvanizing global solidarity, therefore, is the consistent narrative of President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo, who insists that “no one should be left behind” on vaccination and access to medications.\nAs an emerging economy and non-producing country of vaccines, Indonesia has managed to secure and vaccinate 70 percent of its population in slightly over a year. Despite progress, Indonesia continues forging global solidarity to achieve the World Health Organization’s vaccination target of 70 percent of the global population this year. As the acting G20 president, Jokowi will make sure the pandemic is addressed, the economy recovers and the world is well prepared for future pandemics.\nSecond, not long ago, world leaders put pressure on emerging economies like Indonesia to be more ambitious in their emission reduction targets to reach net zero by 2050. Despite lack of implementation on their part, developed countries again reaffirmed the Paris Commitment to US$100 billion financing annually. Many are now worried that financing the devastating geopolitical conflict will replace financing to address the climate crisis.\nWe should not allow this to happen and should stick to our collective efforts to address the climate crisis for all, including for our future generations.\nTherefore, energy transition is among Indonesia’s G20 priorities, despite its being a costly undertaking, especially for Indonesia, a country blessed with coal and fossil fuel resources. Indonesia’s leading by example announced by Jokowi at Glasgow Climate Summit was solid evidence of Indonesia’s determination to walk the talk.\nTo illustrate how costly it is, US$3.8 billon is needed merely to compensate Indonesia’s transition of 5.4 gigawatts of coal power. Indonesia understands this yet remains committed to move forward. Indonesia’s success in significantly slashing the deforestation rate in the past years has improved its confidence to launch the forest and other land uses (FOLU) net sink by 2030. Ambitious peatland and mangrove restoration has progressed significantly and will place Indonesia as a potential carbon sequestration market.\nThe third priority is digital transformation. We remember when digitalization disrupted many things, bringing anxiety and distress. But thanks to Indonesia’s democratic environment and vibrant young demography, digital transformation is now vast and has produced a number of unicorns and decacorns. Democracy and freedom are conducive preconditions for creativity and innovation to flourish. We also understand the challenges of digitalization and its potential threat to peace and security, as in the cases of hoaxes, disinformation and cybercrimes. Therefore, G20 deliberation on this topic should ensure digital transformation is relevant and beneficial to all.\nIndonesia’s firm and consistent approach -- “Recover together, recover stronger” -- is a testament to its pledge to keep the G20 credible and relevant for all. It should remain working in a spirit of multilateralism to promote dialogue and inclusiveness.\nThe geopolitical conflict is devastating, therefore a conducive environment should be created to put the fight to an end. Putting significant pressure on Indonesia is simply unfair when it is trying to salvage the G20 and its relevance to all, particularly developing countries. Many understand this stance, but some fail to do so.\nPressuring, and even bullying Indonesia for its stance is misrepresentation. Indonesia does not have the prerogative to invite or disinvite G20 members. It should be a collective decision of all members. But Indonesia has the right to invite guests, and therefore Jokowi has invited the president of Ukraine.\nThe success of the G20 summit is certainly desirable, not only for Indonesia, but for the whole international community, particularly developing countries. Jokowi and Foreign Minister Retno LP Marsudi have repeatedly called for an immediate stop to the war in Ukraine and respect for territorial integrity. Negotiation and diplomacy should be given their primacy.\nOnly history will tell whether Indonesia has made the right decision to choose dialogue over conflict, partnership over hostility and diplomacy over war mongering. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n&nbsp;***\nThe writer is the director general of American and European Affairs at the Indonesian Foreign Ministry; the views expressed are his own.\n&nbsp;\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get ‘closer to the people’: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Article\nRI identifies 29 potential nuclear power plant sites\nLula 'stable' after emergency surgery\nPutin’s India visit aims to shape global multipolarity\nGovt to review PIK 2’s spatial planning amid land use concerns\nNo new impetus seen for JETP under Trump\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get ‘closer to the people’: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nMore in Paper\nView more\nOpinion\nAnalysis: Govt adopts mandatory B35 biodiesel program as CPO prices tumble\nBusiness\nGlobal chip crunch stunts Indonesia car sales recovery\nBusiness\nXL profit falls in Q3 as tower sale income dries\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo’s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?\nAcademia\nStop with the LGBTQ scapegoating\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nAcademia\nNavigating Indonesia-US relations amid global and domestic changes"

JP/Anggie Angela (JP/Anggie Angela)\nI\nndonesia’s youth movements today are the natural heirs to their forerunners. In the arc of the nation’s history, the young have always played important and revolutionary roles.\nIn records and references, the youth movements fighting against the established older generation are tied to the moments they reached critical points and broke new ground.\nHence, the references to the youths of 1908, 1928, 1945, 1966, 1974, 1978 and – of course – 1998.\nLast year, a nation-wide wave of\nyouth protest\nagainst a set of\ncontroversial bills\nwas seen as the “\nbiggest student protest since 1998\n”.\n“The protests show that youth have retained their critical political outlook and sense of political agency, despite frequent allegations in the past two decades that they had become apathetic,” said Yatun Sastramidjaja, assistant professor in anthropology at the University of Amsterdam, the Netherlands.\nIn her estimation, the current generation of activist youth – coming of age as Indonesia turns 75 this year – represents a seminal moment in the nation’s history.\n“This is for the simple reason that the forerunners’ struggle for freedom from oppression and justice and truth remains necessary and all the more urgent today,” Yatun said.\nA generational consciousness\nYatun said that one recurring driving factor for the youth over different periods was their generational consciousness.\n“They embody the idea that a progressive new era, a better Indonesia, is possible, and that they have a responsibility to lead the way in the ongoing struggle for a better future,” she said.\nThe generational consciousness of youth agency has proven to be a driving force for change in Indonesia’s history.\nYouth and student movements throughout Indonesia’s history have contributed clear visions of progressive change and how this can be achieved.\n“And they have done so in imaginative ways befitting the needs of each historical period,” she said.\nCommon destiny of pre-independence\nkaum muda\nAccording to Yatun, political conditions and available opportunities shaped the roles of youth – specifically\neducated young people\n.\nAccording to her 2016\nstudy\nof Indonesian student movements, in the late Dutch colonial period, native-educated youth was a relatively tiny but highly privileged group.\nThey saw themselves as the agents of a dawning new era and called themselves\nkaum muda\n(the young).\nThey felt more enlightened than their feudalistic and ethnically divided parental generation, and well attuned to progressive developments on the world stage – including the rise of nationalism.\nThey were the first to develop a generational sense of common destiny and collective agency.\nThis was manifested in 1908, when Indonesian students in Jakarta (then Batavia) founded Boedi Oetomo, Indonesia’s first nationalist organisation.\nThey would later organise two youth congresses in 1926 and 1928; the latter produced the famous\nYouth Pledge\nfor allegiance to “one country, one nation, one language”.\nIn 1928,\nkaum muda\nembraced their proclaimed role as “agents of history”; the fate of the nation was intimately tied to the actions of youth.\nThe youth of the national revolution\nDuring the struggle for independence, a new generation of nationalist youth took a more radical stance.\nIn World War II, following the surrender of Japanese Empire - which then occupied Indonesia - on August 15, 1945, activist youth demanded Soekarno immediately proclaim independence.\nThey then\nabducted\nSoekarno and Mohammad Hatta to pressure the two hesitant leaders to proclaim independence, which they later did on August 17.\n&nbsp;\nSoekarno (fourth from left) and Hatta (third from left) in Rengasdengklok.\nWikimedia\n,\nCC BY\n&nbsp;\nThey called themselves by the more inclusive populist term\npemuda\n(youth), insisting on the need to involve\nrakyat\n(common people) in the independence struggle.\nIn the\nnational revolution\nthat followed, they formed numerous struggle groups to lead the people’s battles for freedom.\nBut\npemuda\ngradually lost the lead role in the revolution to the Indonesian army. The youth then moved into the national political arena.\nThe educated youth was redefined into the exclusive term\nmahasiswa\n(university student). It was institutionalised in the form of national student organisations with close affiliation to political parties.\nTowards a period of repression\nWhen the tide turned against Soekarno following the foiled coup of 1965 – which the army, led by General Soeharto, blamed on the Communist Party, Soekarno’s ally – the student organisations mobilised against Soekarno.\nMahasiswa\njoined forces in the Indonesian Student Action Front (KAMI), which for months staged mass demonstrations against the Communist Party and Soekarno’s cabinet in 1966.\nThe student movement played a key role in the transition to Soeharto’s New Order.\nIn the 1970s, the notion of students as a moral force – driven by historical and intellectual duty to defend the oppressed – became a recurring theme in the student movements.\nIn this period, protests against Soeharto’s authoritarian rule were brutally repressed.\nIn\n1974\n, the repression was disguised as mass riots that were blamed on student protest. In\n1978\n, the military raided and occupied universities that were seen as hotbeds of student activism.\nThe student movements of the 1970s laid the groundwork for the fundamental criticism of authoritarianism and state-led crony-capitalism that continues to resonate with student activists to this day.\nActivist youth\nThe student movements of the late 1980s and early 1990s did away with the emasculated label of\nmahasiswa\nand embraced the role of\naktifis\n(activist).\nHence, Yatun said, the student movement of 1998 came out of nowhere, but benefited from a climate of New Order opposition that students had nurtured since the 1970s.\nThe 1998 student movement was initially triggered by the economic crisis that hit Indonesia in late 1997 with devastating impact on the middle classes. It accelerated the process of Soeharto’s delegitimisation.\nHowever, it was the collective memory of “student struggle” that spurred the mass participation of students who had previously not been politically active.\nThese students felt called upon by the public to live up to their historical reputation as defenders of the people in times of crisis.\n“Ultimately, it was the students’ creative capacity not only to create a spectacular movement that grabbed attention and won hearts and minds, but also to present a cogent counter-narrative to the New Order, captured by the slogan of\nreformasi\nand the students’ agenda of reform,” said Yatun.\nThe student movement of 1998, as well as the preceding movements, has since provided a road-map for the student movements that have continued to fight against corruption, injustice and authoritarianism.\nIn constant battle against the old guard\nMuhammad Fajar, a PhD candidate in political science at Northwestern University, Illinois, the United States, said Indonesian youth has always been in a constant battle against the established older generation.\n“The old political elites always try to restrain the younger generation,” Muhammad said.\nWhen the young criticise, the old ones seek to silence them; when the young fight for gender equality, the old ones hold tighter to patriarchy, he said.\nBut Muhammad also warns that emphasising the role of educated youth excludes anyone outside this social category as equal actors in the struggle.\n“Defining the youth roles from the point of view of those who were involved in the historical moments ignores those who didn’t participate, or were left behind, or marginalised from the movements due to lack of access to education, jobs and power,” Muhammad said.\nYouth of today\nMuhammad said that if anything could be learned from historical youth movements, it was to always be wary of the older generation.\n“When the old political elites start to speak about youth, young people should be suspicious. What the elites talk about are their realities and interests, and not the realities faced by the youth,” he said.\n&nbsp;\nIndonesian youth join Climate Strike rally in Jakarta in September 2019.\nLuthfi Dzulfikar/The Conversation Indonesia\n,\nCC BY-NC-ND\n&nbsp;\nWhile they retain the collective desire for progressive change and collective capacity to push for it, today’s youth are mostly driven by the same broader narratives of political, social, economic, ecological, educational, racial and gender justice everywhere.\n“This does not make today’s youth movements any less nationalist. Rather, it makes them all the more suited to lead the Indonesian nation into necessary new directions,” Yatun said.\n---\nAndre Arditya, Editor Politik + Masyarakat,\nThe Conversation\nThis article is republished from\nThe Conversation\nunder a Creative Commons license.

Puspitek Raya in South Tangerang, Banten. Pancasila was officially promulgated by Sukarno on June 1, 1945, but only in 2016 did Pancasila Day become a public holiday.\n(JP / Dhoni Setiawan)\nT\no construct and reconstruct is a basic human activity. We build physical things, they deteriorate and get destroyed, so we reconstruct and build them up again.\nBut when we talk about social constructs, they exist in people’s minds to interpret the world. In no field is this so true as in history and politics with regard to both events and figures where interpretations can be distorted and manipulated, and you can even kill someone more than once. This happened to Sukarno, Indonesia’s first president who served from 1945 to 1966.\nHis obituary in&nbsp;\nThe New York Times\n&nbsp;in 1970 by Alfred Friendly Jr., noted that “he gave the 110 million inhabitants of Indonesia's 3,000 islands a common language, a sense of shared identity and a vision of exuberant destiny”.\nIndeed&nbsp;\nBung\n&nbsp;(brother) Karno as he liked to be called, achieved the incredible feat of leading Indonesia’s independence from Dutch colonialism. He spent a decade under Dutch detention.\nSukarno and Mohammad Hatta, his would-be vice president, declared Indonesia’s independence on Aug. 17, 1945. In June 1 of that same year, Sukarno formulated the five pillars of the state ideology Pancasila, which remains until now a blueprint for the Indonesian nation, its constitution and laws.\nOn July 18, 2020, a statue of Sukarno was erected in Algiers to celebrate Indonesia’s historical connection with Algeria and Indonesia. Algeria had attended the Asia Africa conference in Bandung in 1955, which inspired its struggle for independence from France in 1962.\nThe statue was unveiled virtually in Algiers by Puan Maharani, Sukarno’s granddaughter from Megawati Soekarnoputri, Indonesia’s fifth president (2001-2005).\nThe statue itself was designed and made by Dolorosa Sinaga, renown sculptor, human rights and feminist activist, commissioned by Ridwan Kamil, governor of West Java. Kamil, a former architect, also designed the plaza monument where the statue stands (see “Sukarno monument to grace Algiers’ city center” published in&nbsp;\nThe Jakarta Post\n&nbsp;on June 23).\nAlgeria is the second country that has erected a statue of Sukarno outside of Indonesia. The first was in Mexico in Sukarno Parque, unveiled on Sept. 26, 2019. He has been recognized in other ways, as the name of a street, building and even a tree in Mount Arafat, Saudia Arabia.\nThis affirms his iconic and enduring status in the world and the continued respect and recognition of Sukarno.\nWhat about in Indonesia? As the founder of the Indonesian nation state, he must have unquestioned hero status, right? Unfortunately, it’s not that straightforward.\nDespite the struggles and sacrifices he made, and as Friendly wrote, being recognized as a giant among Asian nationalists after World War II, Sukarno ended his life in relative obscurity. After the alleged Communist coup in 1965, “the right‐wing military leaders consolidated their power and dethroned Mr. Sukarno”.\nFrom the start of the Soeharto New Order military dictatorship (1966-1998), there have been various attempts at de-Sukarnoization. In 1967, the People’s Provisional Consultative Assembly (MPRS) stripped him off his powers and put him under house arrest. During that time, he was denied health care, which led to his death from kidney and heart problems, as well as the isolation and mental torture he was made to suffer. So, this was the first time Sukarno’s was killed. The way he was treated by the then-military government was effectively slow murder.\nSoeharto also denied Sukarno’s request to be buried at the Bogor Palace in West Java over fears that Bogor could be a focal point for opposition to Soeharto’s rule. Instead, he was buried in Blitar, his birthplace in East Java, about 750 kilometers away from Jakarta.\nMonuments and places named after Sukarno were changed: the Gelora Bung Karno Sports Complex in Central Jakarta became the Senayan Sports Complex, Sukarnapura&nbsp; (Sukarno City) in Papua was renamed Jayapura and Puncak Sukarno (Sukarno Peak, also in Papua) became Puncak Jaya. If this was not a killing, it was certainly an erasing.\nIn 1981, he experienced this deletion again, this time more in relation to his political-ideological legacy: Pancasila. Nugroho Notosusanto, the New Order military right-wing historian, claimed that it was Mohammad Yamin, another politician, lawyer, poet, national independence leader, who was the founder of Pancasila and that Sukarno merely used the term. Nugroho also said that June 1 can’t be considered the birth of Pancasila. Instead, the version of Pancasila that became the official state ideology was formulated on Aug. 18, 1945, by the Indonesian Independence Preparatory Committee (PPKI).\nSo, you get the picture? This “reconstruction” of history became the official version of history taught in schools.\nIt is now 22 years since the so-called end of the New Order, but the attempts to further reformulate &nbsp;Pancasila are still going on in the form of the a controversial bill on Pancasila (RUU HIP), which aims to reduce the five principles into three and even one. Who knows what the motive is behind this bill, but luckily, deliberations have been postponed.\nOnly postponed? Why not scrap it altogether?\nThe brouhaha over Sukarno’s legacy, including that of Pancasila, is a clear indication of our immaturity as a nation — certainly that of our lawmakers. What with the coronavirus pandemic still going on unabated with its long term effects such as poverty, decline in education and the health system, and the rise in domestic and sexual violence, don’t our House of Representatives members have a better sense of priority of the nation’s and people’s needs?\n&nbsp;***\nThe writer is the author of&nbsp;\nJulia’s Jihad\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get ‘closer to the people’: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Article\nThe troubled history of South Korean presidents\nFrom ‘Jokowi’ to ‘Mulyono’: The dynamics of names in politics\nWhy the world must resist, prevent neocolonial policies\nLeadership 2024-2029: Balancing national interests and individual competencies\nGovernment provides El Nino aid as part of equitable Pancasila economy\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get ‘closer to the people’: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nMore in Academia\nView more\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo’s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?\nAcademia\nStop with the LGBTQ scapegoating\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nAcademia\nNavigating Indonesia-US relations amid global and domestic changes"

By this choice, France wants to show its solidarity with European and international partners affected by the health crisis.\nIndonesia is a major partner for France in Southeast Asia. Our countries are united by bonds of friendship and since 2011, by a strategic partnership based on common values ​​such as democracy, human rights, tolerance and pluralism within society, and the conception of a secure, law-based international order that we are engaging to strengthen today.\nFacing the growing challenges of globalization, peace and security, be it climate change, the fight against terrorism, radicalism and extremism, disarmament, non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction or health, our two countries recognize the leading role played by the United Nations and other multilateral international organizations.\nIn the Indo-Pacific region, France and Indonesia promote the same vision of an inclusive and open space, in which France intends to contribute to regional stability and growth by strengthening its partnerships in three sectors: maritime cooperation, connectivity and sustainable development (Sustainable Development Goals), fully in line with the priorities of Indonesia and ASEAN, a central player in regional architecture.\nUnpredictable, deadly and long-lasting, the COVID-19 crisis makes us realize that to face a pandemic, only a collective response is effective. There is a need to strengthen multilateralism and international cooperation, France and Indonesia are fully committing in order to better prevent and overcome future crises.\nIt is an ambitious and demanding project that must be driven by common values. In this regard, the spirit of July 14, which we celebrate in France, can be instilled in this momentum. In 1789, our ancestors were convinced that freedom, equality and fraternity should guide all of humanity and that these ideals would achieve full meaning if they were applied to all, beyond borders.

It is supported by the European Union, which has also taken unprecedented measures with a plan of 540 billion euro (US$609.92 billion).\nWe are working with our European partners on a targeted stimulus fund to support the recovery, which is expected to amount to 750 billion euro. In addition, there is a debt buyback plan by the European Central Bank for 1.45 trillion euro.\nFrance has thus taken ambitious measures to face the crisis, with a rescue plan representing 5 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) and 315 billion euro in guarantees for businesses. Furthermore, there are sector plans for aeronautics, automotive industry and tourism and a recovery plan to be presented in the fall by the new government. The challenge is above all to preserve the productive apparatus to allow a rebound once the crisis has been overcome.\nAs members of the Group of 20, France and Indonesia are working together to find a coordinated response to revive economy, trade and investment already damaged by the trade war between the two largest economies in the world.\nThe 200 subsidiaries of French companies present in Indonesia remained during the crisis and will resume their investments. They have a lot to offer in the new sectors after COVID-19, especially in healthcare and digital. In order to facilitate recovery, it is more necessary than ever to continue negotiations between the EU and Indonesia for a free trade agreement (EU-CEPA).\nFrance is Indonesia’s third-largest donor of bilateral public aid. Our development bank, the French Development Agency (AFD), has already proposed to commit $110 million to support the Indonesian budgetary effort in the fight against COVID-19, and we are ready to do more by using the diversity of our financial tools.\nHere again, adaptation will be the keyword, in all sectors.

The virus in both movie and the 2020 real-life health crisis killed millions of victims who suffered from flu symptoms. Social distancing and disinformation come up in the film as they do now in this coronavirus era.\nDirector Steven Soderbegh’s eerily accurate foretelling of the COVID-19 crisis, starring Matt Damon, Kate Winslet, Jude Law, Marion Cotillard, Gwyneth Paltrow and Laurence Fishburne, is a hit again as a result of its uncanny prescience. The nine-year-old drama is climbing up the charts, trending on Amazon Prime Video, iTunes Top 10 and on-demand streaming services.\nIn this vein, we recently interviewed, via video conference, two key figures involved in making “Contagion”: screenwriter Scott Z. Burns and Dr. Ian Lipkin, the film’s chief scientific consultant.\nIan, who is the director of Columbia University’s Center for Infection and Immunity, recently revealed that he tested positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. Larry Brilliant, whose work with the World Health Organization helped eradicate smallpox, and Ian, who is played in the movie by Elliott Gould, are credited by Scott for helping make “Contagion” realistic and accurate.\nScott’s other screenwriting credits include “The Bourne Ultimatum” and “The Informant!,” both of which also starred Matt and were directed by Steven.\nRead also:\n'Contagion' movie stars tell fans coronavirus is 'real life'\nExcerpts of our interview with Scott (S) and Ian (I), who were in two separate locations:\nDr. Lipkin, you tested positive for COVID-19. Can you talk about it?\nI\n:&nbsp;It’s a very unpleasant disease, I can tell you that. You have high fever. A cough that doesn’t remit for two weeks. I had a headache that was one of the worst headaches I have ever had. I have lethargy, fatigue. There was one day that I had shortness of breath—that was quite worrisome.\nIn hindsight, why do you think “Contagion” predicted the coronavirus pandemic so accurately?\nS\n:&nbsp;The response is very simple, which is, when I pitched the movie to Steven Soderbergh, I said, “I only want to do this if it can be accurate and fact-based because I had some awareness that we are in an age of pandemics.” So I was able to get in touch with Ian, who is the best virologist we have in our country.\nIan said the same thing to me, which is, “I will only help you on the movie if it’s very fact and science-based and not some sort of conspiratorial bullshit about a virus coming from a lab or a cellphone tower.”\nThe reason that I knew this was going to happen was because I spoke to people like Ian, who had been trying to stop the virus in this country and all over the world.\nDr. Lipkin, what is the update on controlling the spread of the coronavirus?\nI\n:&nbsp;We found the virus at the end of December 2019. We have a diagnostic test for it. We don’t have enough of them, although we can actually control the spread. Those countries where there’s been success in controlling the pandemic—Germany, Singapore and China, believe it or not—have access to these tests and have been using them quite successfully.\nWe, in the United States, have been behind. The same thing happened in Italy, Spain and elsewhere. We’re using old techniques—isolation—this is the sort of thing we used in the Middle Ages to control a plague. Until we have a vaccine or drugs that everyone can take that are oral and inexpensive, we are limited in what we have.\nIt’s going to be isolation, testing, tracing, finding people who have come in contact with individuals who are infected and isolating them.\nWhat needs to be done?\nI\n:&nbsp;We go back to the mid-2000s when we had SARS and George Bush set up something called National Biosurveillance Advisory Committee that provided specific guidance on how to avoid these particular outbreaks. Then, Obama came in and founded yet another one that made a report that no one paid any attention to.\nOur social services are poor, our Centers for Diseases Control has less funding than it needs. Our budget for science continues to drop, at least in terms of real purchasing power. There aren’t enough people and resources to do what they need to do.\nThe lack of epidemiology, lack of good tests, lack of funding for people who are near the poverty line so that they can safely isolate—these are all things that threaten us all, not only as a local culture, but also internationally.&nbsp;\nAnd the finger pointing now at China, it doesn’t help. They have been far more transparent with us than they were in 2003, when I was actively involved in SARS.\nWhen the National Biosurveillance Advisory Committee came out with the report in 2010, it was designed, in fact, to address all the shortcomings, problems with the communication.\nScott, when you were making the film, did you ever imagine that you would be living through that experience yourself?\nS\n:&nbsp;Having been friends with Ian now for a decade, I’m aware of his work on SARS and MERS. The virus that we chose in “Contagion” is a paramyxovirus. It’s different from a coronavirus. But I do remember having conversations with Ian about the need to develop at some point a universal coronavirus vaccine.\nDr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said that we don’t make the timeline; the virus makes the timeline. How do you envision the route back to normalcy?\nI\n:&nbsp;Tony is a good friend of mine. I’m just going to make a slight twist on what he said. We do in part determine the timeline because we can flatten the curve for isolation. We can improve testing. We can accelerate the advancement of drugs and vaccines. So, to some extent, we are the masters of our own destiny.\nI am working very closely now with Steven Soderbergh in ways we can go back (in the movie industry) to our normal world safely. But the idea would be that we would do testing before people come on set, so we can make sure that they are safe. We would find ways to mitigate risk by frequent use of gloves. Makeup would be individual. These sorts of things.\nIf you are asking about the culture as a whole, we will be moving back to those experiences that are not crowded.\nBut we are not going to move back to where we were a year ago until we have a vaccine and that vaccine is widely deployed.\nDo you still remember the moment when you decided and thought, I am going to make a movie about a virus?&nbsp;\nS\n:&nbsp;My father and I used to have conversations in the early 2000s, about avian flu. I remember the movie “Outbreak” from when I was young. Something about the end of that movie and the science involved always made me feel uncomfortable, both as a writer and a thinker.\nI remember thinking, I want to make a pandemic movie, but I wanted to be guided by the latest science.\nOn the day that we wrapped “The Informant!,” I remember Steven coming to me and saying, “What do you want to do next?” I pitched him “Contagion.” I got halfway through and he said, “I’m in.”\nDr. Lipkin, when do you think can we come up with a COVID\n-19 vaccine?\nI\n:&nbsp;I think that we are going to get there (a vaccine) in a year.\nOne of the movie’s characters, played by Jude Law, is a sinister blogger and a conspiracy theorist who spreads fear and misinformation. Can you discuss the danger that some of these bloggers pose in these pandemic times?\nS\n:&nbsp;It has only gotten worse. And it’s not just bloggers. Unfortunately, now it’s also people in the Federal government. Ian will probably agree that it’s hard enough fighting the disease and to have to now also fight misinformation, especially misinformation that is relying on xenophobia, on incredible political divides that have existed in this country before this thing happened. It makes the job of someone like Ian’s incredibly difficult … because once you get this misinformation out there, it changes people’s behaviors and makes the situation potentially more dangerous.\nCan you talk about how it’s likely not a question of if, but when, another pandemic is going to happen?\nI\n:&nbsp;The first pandemic I encountered was HIV. And we had an influenza pandemic in the 2010s. It’s not the first pandemic and it’s not going to be the last.\nIf you look at the frequency with which these outbreaks occur, it seems to me to be increasing, on the order of every three to five years.&nbsp;\nSo, I am hoping that people will carry forward the lessons of the wild animal markets, data sharing and improvements for platforms of vaccines so that when the next one comes, we’ll be in better shape.\nS\n:&nbsp;I do think as long as we are in a circumstance where we don’t have testing, we can’t know who is sick, [so] it’s not a great idea to shake hands or kiss people.\nLarry Brilliant, who is an epidemiologist, has taught me that nodding to people is totally acceptable.\nIn these pandemic movies, the source of the virus is always outside of the First World. Is that really rooted in reality?\nS\n:&nbsp;[From] just speaking to Dr. Lipkin and … different epidemiologists, I learned that this reliance on wet markets in China is a problem, and it was the source of SARS. But there are diseases that come from all over the world.\nSo, it’s not as easy as saying that we are blaming the Third World because frequently, the development of these wild places is done in poor countries, but done under a banner of industrial colonialism.\nThat being said, there are diseases that have come from America, as well.\nWhy do you think many Covid-19 carriers are asymptomatic? Is that common in other types of viruses?\nI\n:&nbsp;The answer is no. It’s unusual that so many people are asymptomatic. Why, we don’t know yet.\nThere are several theories on how the coronavirus came about. Is it confirmed that it definitely came from an animal?&nbsp;\nS\n:&nbsp;I spent a lot of time every week speaking to scientists, making sure that they’re teaching me what I should be saying to you. There isn’t a single legitimate scientist that I know of, that I am in contact with, who has any reason to believe this is anything but what they would call a zoonotic virus.\nWhat that means is that it came from an animal. Throughout history, we see viruses jump. There are seven coronaviruses that affect human beings. Four of them are like the common cold. One is SARS, which is deadly.\nSo it does not seem strange to me that there could be a new virus that came from a bat that would have affected humans. I think it’s a bad idea for us to continue to give credence to conspiracy theories, because it keeps us from focusing on what the preponderance of science groups say is true and what we have learned historically.\nWhat are you working on now? Will it probably be going to impact us too someday?\nS\n:&nbsp;I’m working on a couple of different projects, but the one that I hope and is relevant to this, is an anthology series for Apple TV Plus about climate change, which I would encourage you to think about.\nWe have scientists telling us that this is a real threat, that bad things are going to happen, and again, we aren’t making the appropriate investments as a society to ward off the worst of it. One of the things that we are going to see with climate change is an increased series of pandemic events.\nThis article appeared on the Philippine Daily Inquirer newspaper website, which is a member of Asia News Network and a media partner of The Jakarta Post\n&nbsp;\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get ‘closer to the people’: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Article\nPandemic treaty talks round wrapping up without a breakthrough\nASEAN, Canada work together for health security\nPrilly, Dikta and the art of cathartic cinema\nAs poor nations' default wave peaks, cash shortage could take its place\nThe danger of antimicrobial resistance and how to tackle it\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get ‘closer to the people’: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nMore in Life\nView more\nHealth\nGESID National Gathering 2024 for the Zero Anemia Initiative\nArt &amp; Culture\nA Tribute to Giacomo Puccini: Celebrating 75 years of Italy-Indonesia relations\nEntertainment\nJay-Z accused in lawsuit of raping 13-year-old girl\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo’s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?\nAcademia\nStop with the LGBTQ scapegoating\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nAcademia\nNavigating Indonesia-US relations amid global and domestic changes"

(Antara/M Risyal Hidayat)\nA\nctually, it was just a matter of time before the year-long skirmishes between Indonesian and Chinese fishermen, the latter often heavily guarded by China’s naval vessels, would escalate and become a more open quarrel between the two countries. But still, last week’s blunt statements by China’s Foreign Ministry on the Natuna Islands were shocking to many Indonesians.\nIn his press briefing in Beijing, the Foreign Ministry spokesman insisted that Chinese fishermen are free to fish in their “traditional” fishing area, which partly overlaps Indonesia’s exclusive economic zone (EEZ), because China’s “position and propositions comply with international law, including UNCLOS [the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]”.\n“So whether the Indonesian side accepts it or not, nothing will change the objective fact that China has rights and interests over the relevant waters,” Geng Shuang asserted.&nbsp;&nbsp;\nSuch an answer has been regularly issued on the South China Sea. Indonesia always tried to distance itself from the dispute, but this time Jakarta can no longer keep to that position. China realizes Indonesia is a key unifying factor for ASEAN, but now ASEAN faces a new situation in which its most important member will also be directly involved in the sensitive issue. The government would be in trouble domestically if it fails to appear firm in ensuring it retains control over the Natunas.\nPresident Joko “Jokowi” Widodo should talk with Chinese President Xi Jinping to prevent a worsening situation. Jokowi is definitely under pressure domestically. He was often accused by his political opponents of being too weak against China for economic reasons. I disagree. The President is being very realistic, as are leaders of other nations.\nPresident Xi needs to know the real feelings and sentiments of the Indonesian people. He will take it seriously when Jokowi honestly conveys his position to his counterpart. The Chinese leader needs to demonstrate more soft power diplomacy. Indonesia’s economy is indeed significantly dependent on China, but China also knows that such dependence will not last eternally.&nbsp;\nIndonesia and China are to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the normalization of&nbsp; their diplomatic relations this year, which always sticks to the principle of mutually beneficial interests, trust and respect for their respective territorial integrity. However, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang soured the commemoration mood with his harsh assertion that no one could stop Chinese fishermen from fishing in Natuna waters. Is it hard to guess why Beijing chose this moment to challenge Indonesia?&nbsp;\nIndonesian officials said Indonesia has to do nothing with China over the Natuna Islands and their surrounding waters, as UNCLOS does not recognize “traditional” fishing grounds, and therefore Jakarta would not open any negotiations with Beijing. Among Indonesian Military officers, however, the common mood is that “China’s position is totally unacceptable and we should take concrete actions in the field”.\nFor millions of Indonesians, China’s diplomat has crossed the line by openly challenging Indonesia’s territorial integrity. Their pride as a nation has been wounded, for right or wrong reasons. “China can easily do it to smaller members of ASEAN, but not with us”, was the common reaction of Indonesians on social media.\nThe two countries reopened official ties after Indonesia unilaterally cut off relations following allegations that China was behind the foiled coup blamed on the now-defunct Indonesian Communist Party (PKI) on Sept. 30, 1965. China strongly denied the accusation. Only after 25 years, then president Soeharto agreed to reopen diplomatic ties.&nbsp;\nSince then, robust bilateral relations have grown, especially economically. Indonesia is the largest member of ASEAN and, along with Vietnam, the country is consistently wary of the world’s economic and military superpowers. Indonesia and many ASEAN members always prefer the military presence of the United States in this region, to counter China’s rising power.&nbsp;\nPresident Jokowi, Foreign Minister Retno LP Marsudi and Defense Minister\nPrabowo Subianto\nhave sounded firm but have refrained from sharply rebuking China, more with an eye to the potential domestic implications. Rather than fearing possible reprisal, they realize the implications could be serious domestically. Resentment against China remains despite warm diplomatic ties: just have a glimpse at the social media buzz.\nNetizens have also raised demands to bring back the hugely popular former fishery and maritime minister, Susi Pudjiastuti. Millions of Indonesians adore her, particularly for her orders to sink foreign fishing vessels, including those of China and Vietnam, which were found guilty of poaching in Indonesian seas. Ordinary people don’t care about other officials’ statements that Susi’s “blowing up and sinking vessels” policy is mainly her PR. She remains their “Superwoman” guarding Indonesia’s seas.&nbsp;\nChina claims nearly the whole of the South China Sea, as reflected in its “nine-dash line”, while the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan claim some parts of the resource-rich ocean territory. Indonesia itself is not a claimant in the South China Sea, but China’s claim based on the “history” of its fishermen’s traditional grounds around the Natunas could also be adopted by other nations. Fishermen from Sulawesi have fished for centuries in Australia’s waters, so could we also claim historic rights there? But wouldn’t that be ridiculous?\nPresident Xi once said: \"By turning antagonism to synergy, hostility to friendship, together we will forge a community of shared destiny for all humankind.\"\nMaintaining sustainable relations between China and Indonesia is much more important than bickering over Natuna. Indonesians need China and vice versa. But the aspirations of the people at the grassroots level are often totally different from those of their leaders.\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get ‘closer to the people’: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Article\nTrump’s second term could deepen Indonesia-China relations\nAssad's fall in Syria exposes limits of China's Middle East diplomacy\nIndonesia to respond appropriately to South China Sea incidents, official says\nGibran to be in charge of government as Prabowo makes overseas trips\nPrabowo vows good friendship at gala dinner with foreign leaders\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get ‘closer to the people’: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nMore in Academia\nView more\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo’s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?\nAcademia\nStop with the LGBTQ scapegoating\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nAcademia\nNavigating Indonesia-US relations amid global and domestic changes"

Tai-chi practitioners, tea ceremony masters, experts in aromatic culture, flower arrangement artists and players of\nguqin\n— a Chinese musical instrument — are China’s latest cultural ambassadors to Southeast Asia.\nThe tour was the brainchild of the Philippines mission to ASEAN, which conceived of a platform to increase Chinese-ASEAN cultural exchanges during a 2018 visit to Beijing by the Committee of Permanent Representatives to ASEAN.\n“I hope that this tour of Chinese folk culture will serve as a window for ASEAN to understand Chinese history, culture and art. We are looking forward to more cooperation between ASEAN and China in this field,” said Noel Servigon, the permanent representative of the Philippines to ASEAN, in a speech during the official launch of the tour on Monday at the ASEAN Secretariat in Jakarta.\nSince 2012, Chinese President Xi Jinping has advocated for greater cultural exchanges between countries as part of his platform of “a community of common destiny”. Beijing’s acts of cultural diplomacy in Southeast Asia can be understood as one such attempt at people-to-people exchanges.\nChina’s cultural ambassadors are not new to the ASEAN region. Over the course of the 2014 China-ASEAN Cultural Year, Chinese fan dancers and folk musicians filled the theater at Balai Kartini in Jakarta in an effort by the Chinese government to exhibit China’s cultural achievements in Southeast Asia. Confucius institutes in Indonesia and worldwide act as vessels for the dissemination of Chinese culture and education.\n“China finds it easy to place a wedge in Southeast Asia by showing that only China can connect with Southeast Asia culturally, not countries like the United States and Western Europe,” said Xue Gong, a research fellow in China-ASEAN relations at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore.\nChina’s Ambassador to ASEAN, Huang Xilian, emphasized the cultural similarities between Southeast Asian countries and China, in an interview with The Jakarta Post on Monday. “China and ASEAN countries both belong to Asian civilizations or Eastern civilizations or Oriental civilizations with a very rich culture,” said Huang.\nEarlier this year, Huang admitted to a lack of understanding between China and ASEAN countries after a survey of Southeast Asians conducted by the Singapore-based ASEAN Studies Center revealed that 51.5 percent of respondents felt distrust toward China’s influence in the region. The majority said they believed China intends to be a revisionist power and turn Southeast Asia into its sphere of influence.\n“Increasing trust between China and ASEAN countries is a process we need to promote from time to time,” Huang said on Monday, “In order to do this, we need to conduct changes from various perspectives and folk culture is one important perspective to contribute to this process since folk culture is something that ordinary people are fond of.”\nWhile China’s economic, political and strategic influence in Southeast Asia is high, the survey concluded that Chinese soft power penetration in mainland Southeast Asia remains low, with a very small minority of respondents desiring to travel to or study in China.\n“Due to the trust deficit in the region and prevalent Chinese threat perceptions, China realizes it still needs to invest in other areas than just infrastructure projects and cultural or people-to-people exchanges are a very important pillar of its Belt and Road Initiative,” said Gong.\nThe logo for the ASEAN-China Young Leaders Scholarship was also unveiled at the launch of the tour on Monday, marking a step toward increased educational partnerships between China and Southeast Asia. The scholarship would provide funding for Southeast Asian nationals to pursue graduate education, research and training in China.\nHowever, Gong expressed doubt about the extent to which China’s soft power overtures would be effective in changing Southeast Asian perceptions of China as a threat in the region.\n“In international relations theory, how useful and effective soft power can be is very difficult to determine. Realists only believe military power and, to a large extent, economic power are effective,” said Gong. “I don’t think soft power will surpass China’s emphasis on economic statecraft. It is only playing a complementary role in terms of reducing the concerns of Southeast Asian countries.”\nPresident Xi first proposed the Belt and Road Initiative during a 2013 visit to Indonesia.\n&nbsp;\n—\nThe writer is an intern at\nThe Jakarta Post.\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get ‘closer to the people’: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Article\nNavigating Indonesia-US relations amid global and domestic changes\nMegawati supports free meals program, with caveat\nJapan seeks Indonesia’s help to solve labor crisis\nRussia teams up with BRICS to create AI alliance\nIndonesia must regain credibility as an honest broker\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get ‘closer to the people’: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nMore in News\nView more\nOpinion\nAnalysis: Govt adopts mandatory B35 biodiesel program as CPO prices tumble\nBusiness\nGlobal chip crunch stunts Indonesia car sales recovery\nBusiness\nXL profit falls in Q3 as tower sale income dries\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo’s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?\nAcademia\nStop with the LGBTQ scapegoating\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nAcademia\nNavigating Indonesia-US relations amid global and domestic changes"

Rogue goes on to thrash both Captain America and Thor, a fight that should offer a grand entrance for mutants into the MCU!\nHaving Brie Larson’s Captain Marvel lose her powers to Rogue would add some conflict into the mix, and then there’s the involvement of the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants (Destiny, Avalanche, Pyro and Mystique), which should make things even more interesting.\nSecret Wars (1984)\nMarvel’s first ever crossover event also offers the perfect chance to introduce the X-Men into the MCU. The premise is simple – an omnipotent being named the Beyonder transports a combination of superheroes (including from Avengers, X-Men and the Fantastic Four) and pits them against their respective rogues, with the winners promised everything they ever desired!\nSince Marvel now owns the rights to the Fantastic Four as well as the X-Men, this would be a simple matter of transporting these “new” characters from their respective dimensions (yes, we’re talking multiverse here) and conveniently getting them “stuck” in the MCU for subsequent movies.\nRead also:\nRobert Downey Jr. thanks fans for Marvel career\nX-Men Vs Avengers (1987)\nX-Men vs. the Avengers (1987) comic books Scan is of Actual Comic!\nhttps://t.co/FMsHQF2S1I\n— IFIO (@IFIOCanada)\nApril 22, 2019\nIt took Marvel 23 years to finally allow both teams to headline a story, but this four-parter was worth the wait.\nIt revolves around a reformed Magneto trying to utilise technology to telepathically remove humanity’s prejudice against mutants. With the X-Men and Avengers at odds over this course of action, things get even more complicated with the arrival of the Soviet Super Soldiers.\nMagneto is a formidable opponent for both Avengers and X-Men alike, and would make for a great reason for the two teams to first fight each other over him and then later, work together to stop him.\nAvengers/X-Men: Bloodties (1993)\nThis five-part mini-series was released in conjunction with both teams’ 30th anniversaries, using both Quicksilver and the Scarlet Witch as the nexus. With the siblings having roots in both Avengers and the X-Men, the kidnapping of Luna (Quicksilver’s daughter with Inhuman princess Crystal) by Fabian Cortez (Magneto’s former right hand man) inadvertently unites both the X-Men and Avengers against a common enemy.\nThis would work for the simple reason that both Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch are already in the MCU. Since the MCU version of Quicksilver was killed in Avengers: Age Of Ultron, this conveniently paves the way for the Fox version of Quicksilver to take his place (though it remains to be seen how they solve the brother/sister relationship with Wanda and also the “having a baby with an Inhuman princess” part).\nOnslaught (1996)\nMarvel Universe Onslaught #1 October 1996 Marvel Comics Never Read\nhttps://t.co/yTHUmZL3Ve\npic.twitter.com/fWDzFjESnQ\n— BuyingToys (@BuyingToys)\nDecember 24, 2018\nThis has cinematic value written all over it! From Professor Xavier’s and Magneto’s “dark sides” manifesting into a powerful sentient psionic entity named Onslaught, to revelations of Xavier’s “lust” for Jean Grey, this 90s mega event has more drama than the entire MCU combined.\nWith Professor X, the world’s most powerful telepath, going bad, Onslaught represents a credible threat that would need the combined forces of the Avengers and X-Men to defeat. As an added bonus, the Fantastic Four are also part of the story in the comic books!\nAvengers Vs X-Men (2012)\nAvengers Vs X-Men - COVER (2012)\npic.twitter.com/GsuRZgZJd9\n— Marvel Perfect Panels (@Marvel_CoPics)\nMay 12, 2018\nThe mother of all Avengers versus X-Men stories. The impending arrival of the Phoenix Force pits both teams against each other – the Avengers want to destroy it once and for all, while the X-Men see the Phoenix Force as a chance to rebuild a mutant population that was still recovering from House of M, which had left them decimated.\nWhat happens next, however, went beyond both sides’ expectations – five of the X-Men (Cyclops, Emma Frost, Colossus, Namor, and Magik) found themselves imbued with the Phoenix Force and decide to use its power to shape the world to their will.\nThe story is not only one of the most significant Avengers versus X-Men events, it also includes some universe-shaking moments, like the death of Professor X at the hands of Cyclops, and Namor sending a tidal wave to destroy Wakanda!\nDeadpool Kills The Marvel Universe (2012)\nDeadpool Kills the Marvel Universe\n#2A\n2012 1st Printing VF+ 8.5 on eBay:\nhttps://t.co/QQTuXI5lhn\n#comicbooks\n#marvel\n#deadpool\npic.twitter.com/4GfSKVhpxp\n— COM1CBOOKS (@COM1CBOOKS)\nJuly 13, 2018\nHow could we forget about Deadpool? Disney’s purchase of Fox also means that the Merc With A Mouth is now in the Mouse House, and what better way to introduce him than by getting him to kill everyone in the MCU?\nIn this totally bizarre mini-series, Deadpool’s brain is “prodded” one too many times, compelling him to kill every single superhero, anti-hero, and villain in the Marvel universe. Why? Who cares?\nGranted, it wouldn’t make much business sense for Marvel Studios to kill off all their heroes and leave Deadpool the sole survivor, but this particular story would make a great “What If” story that could be turned into an R-rated movie featuring scene after scene of Deadpool killing every single superhero in the MCU. Yeah, we’d definitely watch that.\nThis article appeared on The Star newspaper website, which is a member of Asia News Network and a media partner of The Jakarta Post\n&nbsp;\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get ‘closer to the people’: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Article\nJeremy Renner, Marvel's Hawkeye, has surgery after snow plow accident\nDel Toro explores fascism in dark, animated ‘Pinocchio’\nQueen Elizabeth's life features in a new comic book\nJtoku Indonesia celebrates \"inner power\" through atypical superheroes\nKeanu Reeves to make his comic book debut with ‘BRZRKR’\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get ‘closer to the people’: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nMore in Life\nView more\nHealth\nGESID National Gathering 2024 for the Zero Anemia Initiative\nArt &amp; Culture\nA Tribute to Giacomo Puccini: Celebrating 75 years of Italy-Indonesia relations\nEntertainment\nJay-Z accused in lawsuit of raping 13-year-old girl\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo’s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?\nAcademia\nStop with the LGBTQ scapegoating\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nAcademia\nNavigating Indonesia-US relations amid global and domestic changes"

(AFP/Fabrice Coffrini)\nT\nhirty years ago this month, a young British physician working at a lab near Geneva invented a system for scientists to share information that would ultimately change humanity.\nBut three decades after he invented the World Wide Web, Tim Berners-Lee has warned that his creation has been \"hijacked by crooks\" that may spell its destruction.\nBerner-Lee's old office at Europe's physics lab CERN now looks no different than the others lining the long, nondescript corridor within the expansive compound.\nThe only indication that history was made here is a small commemorative plaque and a page from an old CERN directory hung on the door, with \"MOMENTARILY OUT OF OFFICE!\" written in jest next to Berners-Lee's name.\n\"Tim worked a lot,\" said technician Francois Fluckiger, who took charge of the web team after Berners-Lee left for the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1994.\n\"The lights were always on in his office,\" Fluckiger told AFP.\nHistory in the making&nbsp;\nBerners-Lee was responsible for CERN's internal directory but was interested in ways to allow the thousands of scientists around the world who cooperated with the lab to more easily share their work.\nHis vision for \"a decentralised information management system\" soon gave birth to the web.\nPrimitive forms of the internet -- a network linking computers -- had previously existed, but it was the World Wide Web that allowed web pages to be collected and accessed with a browser.\n\"Very early on, we had the feeling that history was in the making,\" Fluckiger said.\nIn 1990, Belgian scientist Robert Cailliau came onboard to help promote the invention, which used Hypertext Markup Language, or HTML, as a standard to create webpages.\nThey created the Hypertext Transfer Protocol, or HTTP, which allows users to access resources by clicking on hyperlinks, and also Uniform Resource Locators, or URLs, as a website address system.\nAt the end of 1990, Berners-Lee set CERN's first web navigator server into action.&nbsp;\nRead also:\nWorldwide web inventor wants new 'contract' to make web safe\nThe browser was released outside of CERN in early 1991, first to other research institutions and later to the public.&nbsp;\nFluckiger, now retired, hailed the web as one of three major inventions in the 20th century that enabled the digital society, alongside the Internet Protocol (IP) and Google's search algorithms.\nBut he lamented the \"online bullying, fake news, and mass hysteria\" that flourish online as well as threats to privacy.\n\"One has to ask oneself if we did not, in the end, create a completely out-of-control monster.\"\n'Crooks and trolls'&nbsp;\nBerners-Lee has launched his own campaign to \"save the web\".\nAt the Web Summit in Lisbon last November, he called for a new \"Contract for the Web\", based on access for all and the fundamental right to privacy,&nbsp;among other things.\n\"The web has been hijacked by crooks and trolls who have used it to manipulate people all over the world,\" Berners-Lee warned in a New York Times op-ed in December, citing threats ranging from the dark web, to cyber crime, fake news and personal data theft.\nIn January, the man dubbed the \"father of the web\" urged the global elites at the World Economic Forum in Davos to join the fight against the \"polarisation\" of online debates.\nHe called for discussion platforms that connect people with different opinions and backgrounds, contrary to today's common practice of creating online ghettos, filter bubbles and feedback loops where people rarely encounter opinions different from their own.\nUnited Nations chief Antonio Guterres also voiced concerns at Davos over the direction the web was taking.&nbsp;\nHe warned of the impact \"of the dark web and the deep web and all the problems of cyber security\", and called for the creation of \"soft mechanisms\" to help rein in countries using this technology to violate human rights.\nOpen source&nbsp;\nBack in 1989, no one could have foreseen the importance of the emerging web.\nCERN has held onto only a few souvenirs from the early days: the first memo that Berners-Lee drafted about his invention, his black NeXT computer station and his keyboard.&nbsp;\nBut while CERN may not have preserved many keepsakes to memorialise the historic invention, it has strived to prevent the web from falling into the wrong hands.\nIn 1993, the organisation announced it was putting the web software into the public domain, which could have allowed any individual or business to claim it as their own and control its development.\nBut destiny, with a little help from Fluckiger, helped avert potential disaster.&nbsp;\nAfter discussions with CERN's legal service, Fluckiger decided in 1994 to launch a new open source version of the web.\nThat proved a crucial move that allowed CERN to retain the intellectual property rights to the invention while giving access to anyone to use and modify the web freely and without cost.\nIn 1995, the intellectual property rights were transferred to a consortium set up by Berners-Lee based out of MIT, called W3C.\n\"We were lucky that during those 18 months, no one seized the web,\" Fluckiger said.\n\"Otherwise, there might not have been a web today.\"\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get ‘closer to the people’:

The recently released film Aquaman stars hyper-masculine Hawaiian hunk Jason Momoa as Arthur Curry, the titular character. The film follows the journey of Aquaman, the son of a lighthouse keeper with Atlanna, an underwater crown-princess, as he looks to fulfill his destiny of becoming king of Atlantis.\nCheck out the dialogue between Aquaman and Mera, a badass underwater Atlantean princess. Aquaman: “I’m no leader. I’m not a king”.&nbsp; Mera: “Atlantis has always had a king. Now it needs something more”. Aquaman: “Well, what could be greater than a king?” Mera: “A hero. A king fights for his nation. A hero fights for everyone.”\nWow! This dialogue really resonated with me! So inspiring, as a hero indeed fights for everyone!\nMaybe we should make an Indonesian version of Aquaman, to inspire us since our political leaders don’t. Which of our Indonesian actors could play Aquaman? Reza Rahadian! He’s not big and burley like Momoa, but he’s one of Indonesia’s best and most versatile actors and has played a very wide range of roles. I saw Reza in a pencak silat film, Pendekar Tongkat Emas (The Golden Cane Warrior), which, like Aquaman, was also about leadership struggles. He played Biru, a villain, but as an actor, he could easily turn himself into a hero.\nBut you know what? Reza probably doesn’t feel the need to play a superhero in a movie, because he’s already a hero in real life as a Yappika Goodwill Ambassador.\nYappika stands for Aliansi Masyarakat Sipil untuk Demokrasi (Civil Society Alliance for Democracy). In 2016, Yappika became a member of ActionAid International, a federation of non-profit organizations in 45 countries. Together with the community, the Yappika-ActionAid program deals with poverty and injustice, and works to develop education, health and public services.\nI had the opportunity to find out more about the program when, on Nov. 29, I attended a charity and advocacy event co-hosted by Rachel Malik, wife of the British ambassador to Indonesia, with BritCham’s Professional Women’s Group.\nThe event was basically an awareness-raising discussion featuring three speakers. The first was Malik, who said, as an ambassador’s wife in Jakarta, she had an entire team of staff members who help her with the household duties she did on her own for her family when she was in London. So now she has time on her hands and is using it for good causes. One of them is being a Yappika Goodwill Ambassador.\nThe second speaker was Pierre Destexhe, program manager of the European Union delegation in Indonesia who explained an EU-funded project called “Promoting civil society-led initiatives for inclusive and quality education in Indonesia”. The grant provided by the EU is to the sum of almost 750,000 euros (US$855.075) and was implemented by Yappika-ActionAid in collaboration with three partners. The three-and a half-year project is expected to reach 150,000 elementary school kids, including children with disabilities.\nLast but not least was Reza, who, like many well-known Hollywood actors, is lending his star power for good causes. He felt motivated to be involved with the Yappika project because he can personally relate to it. His mother struggled to raise him and his younger brother as a single parent. Reza said it was she who inspired him to love and care for others.\nThat came as a surprise to me because when you see him as such a successful actor, you wouldn’t have imagined that he was sent out of the classroom because he was late in paying his school fees. But this is how and why he has such empathy for the unfortunate many, not just in education but also in health and other social services. He has also been a Sustainable Development Goals Mover for the United Nations Development Fund (UNDP) Indonesia since 2016.\nReza has been a Yappika ambassador for two years, traveling around Indonesia to advocate that the local government allocate more funds toward education infrastructure. He pointed out that 18.6 percent of elementary school classrooms and 16.62 percent of junior high school classrooms in Indonesia were damaged. At least 6.6 million children are at risk because studying in damaged classrooms means they can collapse at any time (see daruratsekolah.com). Since 2014, 105 children have been injured and four children have been killed. Gulp!\nThis is the time of the year for caring and sharing. We are reminded by three events in December. The first is the commemoration of International Human Solidarity Day every Dec. 20, which among others, aims “to promote solidarity for the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals including poverty eradication”.\nThe second of course is Christmas. The idea to donate to charities instead of the customary orgy of consumerism, especially in Western countries, has been floating around and seems to be gaining some traction.\nThen on New Year’s, it is a time for resolutions. Why don’t you consider adopting caring more for others as your resolution, besides the more common ones of losing weight and getting more exercise?\nRecently, I came across a talk by Radranath Swami, who used an analogy referencing the Muir Woods near San Francisco, which contains redwood and sequoia trees, among the largest trees on the planet. Amazingly, the roots are not that deep, so how do they endure massive storms, blizzards and earthquakes? It turns out that the roots reached outward, “seeking the roots of other redwood trees. When they meet, they intertwine, making a permanent bond with each other”, Swami said. “In this way, all the redwood trees in the entire forest are either directly or indirectly giving support to each other. In the Muir Woods, nature is giving humanity a very crucial lesson, that our real strength is in our willingness to care for and support each other.”\nThe slogan of the Justice League is, “You can’t save the world alone”. And boy, if there was ever a time the world needs saving, it’s now! So why not start your path to hero-hood by getting involved with Yappika (yappika-actionaid.or.id), either by donating or volunteering, and be part of the change you want to see in the world!\n_______________________\nThe writer is the author of\nJulia’s Jihad.\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get ‘closer to the people’: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Articles\nNavigating Indonesia-US relations amid global and domestic changes\nMegawati supports free meals program, with caveat\nJapan seeks Indonesia’s help to solve labor crisis\nRussia teams up with BRICS to create AI alliance\nIndonesia must regain credibility as an honest broker\nRelated Article\nNavigating Indonesia-US relations amid global and domestic changes\nMegawati supports free meals program, with caveat\nJapan seeks Indonesia’s help to solve labor crisis\nRussia teams up with BRICS to create AI alliance\nIndonesia must regain credibility as an honest broker\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get ‘closer to the people’: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nMore in News\nView more\nOpinion\nAnalysis: Govt adopts mandatory B35 biodiesel program as CPO prices tumble\nBusiness\nGlobal chip crunch stunts Indonesia car sales recovery\nBusiness\nXL profit falls in Q3 as tower sale income dries\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo’s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?\nAcademia\nStop with the LGBTQ scapegoating\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nAcademia\nNavigating Indonesia-US relations amid global and domestic changes"

After working for nine months, the commission of eight members and 60 staffers completed the report of 1,800 pages on 3,400 cases of “disappearances after arrests, executions and torture leading to death committed by government agents”, as cited by the researcher Priscilla B. Hayner.\nWhat is inspiring from this Chilean experience is that Aylwin then made a public statement that on behalf of the state, he begged forgiveness for what had happened to the victims and asked the armed forces to “make gestures of recognition of the pain caused”.\nAs a follow-up of the report, in 1992 the government issued a law on the creation of a national corporation for reparation and reconciliation to provide reparation for the victims.\nWe can see a common historical destiny between Chile and Indonesia — unfortunately a bitter one. Both beautiful countries had been the field of experiments of the United States’ economic and political greed. There is abundant evidence of US involvement in Indonesia’s darkest history in 1965 and 1966, when the leftists were eliminated, which led to the fall of left-leaning president Sukarno and the rise of Soeharto’s New Order regime.\nLess than a decade later on Sept. 11, 1973, Gen. Augusto Pinochet staged a coup d’état against democratically elected president Allende. In Santiago, I asked a senior civil society leader about the slogan “Operacion Yakarta” (Operation Jakarta) during the 1973 bloodshed. He said the slogans, sprawled as graffiti in the streets of Santiago, was a form of terror and intimidation by the coup leader against leftists in Chile. “We learned about the horrifying witch hunt of communists in Jakarta in 1965. So the word ‘Jakarta’ created an emotional effect of horror among the leftists.”\nSeveral of my Chilean friends have been working for the desaparecidos (disappeared persons) in Chile. They have been fighting for decades for their disappeared loved ones — husbands, wives, daughters, sons or other relatives.\nDuring my brief visit, I dropped by the office of the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, where demonstrations during Pinochet’s era drew global attention to human rights violations.\nThe most emotional visit was to the Museum of Memory and Human Rights, where I trembled and was teary-eyed at the sight of the objects presented and the narratives told.\nThey brought me to memories of repression under Indonesia’s authoritarian government.\nThis museum is packed with memorial objects related to repression and despair. But visitors would also come away with a sense of hope, for the Museum aimed both at informing the public on the widespread and intense oppression under the Pinochet junta (1973 to 1990) and also how to prevent the dark past from ever happening again, as expressed in their iconic words nunca más (never again).\nLike Chile, with our similar past, I still harbor hope that the Indonesian government will be daring and determined to take steps to resolve past human rights violation, as President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo has reiterated.\nIt is never too late. And because of the magnitude of the challenges, people will understand if the government starts from a small step, for as the proverb says, “A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.”\n_____________________________\nThe writer is a senior program officer for human rights and democracy at the International NGO Forum on Indonesian Development (INFID).

His task as the Chosen One is to protect his people, the&nbsp;Israelites, against their Philistine oppressors led by King Balek (Billy Zane) and his son Prince Rallah (Jackson Rathbone), who feels simultaneously threatened by and jealous of Samson’s strength.\nAs the popular story goes, Samson is betrayed by Delilah (Caitlin Leahy), who cuts his hair. Samson loses his power and becomes a prisoner of Rallah, until the now-blinded man begs forgiveness from God and finally takes his vengeance.\nIt is a well-known story that throws up no surprises, and sadly the film also does not do much to offer us something unexpected. It diligently adheres to the conventions of the religious historical genre: evil prince hungry for power versus good common man who happens to be immensely strong. Nothing surprises us and nothing makes us leave in wonderment.\nDirector Bruce MacDonald chose to present a rather stale depiction of Samson’s power. He is seen wrestling a charging lion, breaking down a wooden door double his size, and killing 1,000&nbsp;soldiers one at a time using only the jawbone of a donkey, there is little there to provoke a sense of awe in viewers. &nbsp;\nRead also:\n'Black Panther' pounces to box office glory over holiday weekend\nGod’s name is stated repeatedly throughout the film, more so when Samson needs protection and to escape from dire situations. This could be traced back to its production house, Pure Flix, which produces Christian and family-friendly films. That also means that blood and gore is kept to a minimum, as in the eye-gouging scene, where we are to infer what is happening through Samson’s cries.\nRidiculous moments in the film are abundant: mentioning sorrow and loss ever so lightly with smiles aplenty, beards so fake they would make 2012’s hipsters collectively grumble, or how Samson needs only a moment of walking in the forest or along the beach peppered with overused sentiments such as “Do you believe in destiny?” to fall in love.\nThe film is mostly haunted by its sluggish pacing and wooden performances; a result of playing it safe and abstaining from injecting complex human emotions into the characters.\nUnderneath all that, it is still a story you can watch if you prefer a film about a pious superhero with next-to-nothing special effects. There is that feeling of Old Hollywood epics and admittedly it is seldom boring.

MH Thamrin in Central Jakarta. The parade displayed national and traditional cultures from ASEAN member countries. (JP/Ibrahim Irsyad)\nT\nhe culture and history of Southeast Asia is influenced by India, and also China to a large extent, as a dominant power in the past. India is poised today to regain its former glory, driven by its Act East policy. The policy, first announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi during the 2014 ASEAN Summit, is an upgraded iteration of the Look East policy of 1992, announced by then prime minister Narasimha Rao. India is now aiming for better engagements with countries to its east, including those of ASEAN, not only in the realm of economics, but also politics and security.\nLeaders from India and all 10 ASEAN members states are gathering in New Delhi today (Jan. 25) for the 25th ASEAN-India Commemorative Summit, with big hopes that they will convert cultural ties of over a millennia into tangible mutual benefits. With a population of some 1.2 billion, India is definitely a promising market for ASEAN entrepreneurs and businesses. It will also certainly be challenging.\nIndia still needs to improve not only its infrastructure, which in itself provides investment opportunities, but also its bureaucracy to be more efficient in processing the necessary licenses and permits for foreign investors to operate in the subcontinent.\nMeanwhile, ASEAN members are also expecting more Indian companies to enter their markets and flourish together. The ASEAN-India alliance is targeting US$200 billion in bilateral trade by 2020. With the rise of protectionism, however, much work needs to be done to ensure stakeholders that foreign investment is not all bad. Governments need to balance their national interests with the need to open their markets toward economic growth.\nIndia is maintaining a benign stance with respect to other countries’ sovereignty and their respective needs. A similar approach is also taken in the political and security spheres with respect to rule of law, and by adopting peaceful means to resolve problems such as border disputes.\nState leaders are also expected to raise various security issues at the Summit, ranging from counterterrorism to maritime security. India stresses that ASEAN countries are its immediate neighbors, and therefore closer cooperation is only natural, especially in maritime security.\nLike Indonesia’s recent doctrine of “global maritime fulcrum,” India has its own maritime policy called the sagarmala, or “ocean garland,” which focuses on improving access to ports. With its catchphrase of “port-led prosperity,” the Indian policy joins port operators with railway networks for better connectivity in transporting goods and passengers.\nIndia has also affirmed its recognition of ASEAN’s unity and centrality in maintaining security and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region. ASEAN countries must, however, come to terms and unite under the ASEAN flag to achieve its vision of “One ASEAN, One Community.” Once ASEAN members unite, there is nothing to stop them from reaching shared prosperity with India, as exemplified by the Summit’s theme of “Shared values, Common Destiny”.\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get ‘closer to the people’: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Article\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nBRICS welcomes Indonesia: A view from New Delhi\nFadli Zon promises to continue repatriating cultural artifacts\nBret Easton Ellis: 'I was always suspicious of wealth'\nNew exhibition navigates memories to celebrate Indonesia’s geographic diversity\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get ‘closer to the people’: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nMore in Academia\nView more\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo’s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nAcademia\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?\nAcademia\nStop with the LGBTQ scapegoating\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities"

(Shutterstock/File)\nW\nhen people think of dolphins, they think of intelligent, lively mammals. Maybe they’ll remember the documentaries on Nat Geo Wild about how dolphins assign themselves names and about human-dolphin interaction.\nBut what about the dark side that the species has gone through?\nThe Taiji Cove dolphin hunt happens annually in Japan. Generally taking place between September and March, at least 2,000&nbsp;dolphins and porpoises are hunted and slaughtered annually. An extra month is added for the hunting of pilot whales. Taiji dolphin hunters also capture dolphin calves to sell to nearby aquariums and zoos while the rest are killed and sold to supermarkets. Dolphins are generally worth more money dead than alive, and offer more income for hunts. Dolphin and whale meat costs a lot of money and is said to be part of a very fundamental culture of Japan.\nThe Taiji dolphin killings first came to light in 2009, after a film called\nThe Cove\nwas released.\nThe Cove\nhas won 25 awards, and since its release, Japan has been pressured to end the Taiji Cove killings.\nHowever, much to the frustration of the community, the Japanese government has sided with fishermen, claiming that the killings are part of tradition and culture, even though the killings started only in 1969. In response to the film, the fishermen put up more barriers, preventing outsiders from seeing dolphins being killed.\nThe notorious Taiji Cove, Japan, where the slaughter of dolphins happens annually.  (Shutterstock/File)\nUnfortunately, the problem can’t be solved just by putting up barriers. During the 2016-2017 hunting season, many social media sites, especially Twitter, were flooded with activists who went to Taiji Cove to livestream and tweet the killings. Almost every person in the animal world was aware of the Taiji Cove dolphin killings. A lot of signatures were collected on online petitions, and a lot of people boycotted aquariums that bought dolphins. Sea World, which in early 2017 came under pressure because of the death of an orca that was highlighted in the 2013 documentary\nBlackfish\n, must deal with even more hate from activists.\nRead also:\nThailand leads the pack for Asia's abused tourist elephants\nThe plight of sea creatures isn't highlighted only in documentaries. It can be observed in animated films, like\nFinding Nemo, Finding Dory\nand Moana\n.\nThe critically appraised\nMoana\nhas been applauded for its representation of a minority. The movie centers on a young girl named Moana who wants to break away from village traditions. Despite the taboo of leaving the small island, Moana chooses to pursue her destiny and sets sail on the sea.\nThe difference between the tradition of Moana’s people and the Japanese Taiji dolphin hunters is quite simple. People hide behind the word \"tradition\" for a lot of different reasons. The first reason behind that is because people are afraid of change. This is apparent in the\nMoana\nfilm. The plot of\nMoana\nrevolves around how tradition can be comfortable and how major changes can be considered scary. When people settle into a routine, they tend to want to stay in their comfortable routine instead of trying and doing something new. Moana learned a lot of new things on her journey, yet she still missed her old home.\nHowever, the word tradition for the hunters at Taiji Cove isn’t just about being afraid of change. The tradition there includes greed and closed-mindedness. Most traditions and cultures make sense, like myths and legends as they teach people lessons, which make people too comfortable to move on. But if tradition is corrupted with greed, then it cannot be said to be a part of tradition.\nRead also:\nFantastic animals of Indonesia and where to find them\nIt is time for us to take a step back and rethink tradition, as tradition might be too ingrained in us to be examined objectively -- from a big thing like the annual dolphin hunt to something as mundane as going to aquariums or zoos.\nCaptive animals have likely gone through a lot of psychological trauma at watching their family killed in front of their eyes and being forcefully separated from their family. Such animals would die quickly and face a lot of health issues. Yes, it is possible for emotions to affect an animal, both positively and negatively. It has been proven again and again how sensitive animals can be. Losing everything so suddenly can result in everything else left in life to become pointless.\nMoana\nshows us that even nature can turn into a monster. Nature can be a beautiful world that everyone can enjoy, or a burning world destroyed through human intervention. It’s time to get up and move on to begin a new life, one where people and nature can live in harmony. (dev/kes)\n***\nElysa Ng is a 15-year-old middle high student.

(-/-)\nI\nndonesia has had a long history of positive and fruitful relations with the South Pacific region and its 14 countries and 10 million inhabitants.\nThe overall relationship between the two sides has shown a slow but steady increase in economic cooperation over the years.\nIn 2013 alone, Indonesia donated millions of US dollars to Pacific countries to be used in various fields. In early 2016, Foreign Minister Retno LP Marsudi visited Pacific countries to reiterate Indonesia’s interest in strengthening relations with them.\nThe Foreign Ministry has expressed its belief that this relationship has the potential for further development.\n“Becoming part of the Pacific is destiny. You can choose your friends but not your neighbors,” said Desra Percaya, who is director general for Asia-Pacific and African Affairs of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Indonesia.\n“Indonesia’s diplomatic mission in the Pacific is to create a territory that is safe, stable and friendly, and to increase economic cooperation, trade, investment and social-cultural relations.”\nThe country has developed diplomatic relations with nearly all countries in the Pacific, and is currently in the process of opening a relationship with the Cook Islands.\nIts relations with Pacific nations encompasses aspects like capacity building, diplomatic training, inter-university partnerships (such as between Pasundan University and Fiji National University) and work on dealing with common concerns, such as climate change.\nWith the Fiji archipelago, for instance, Indonesia has maintained a strong and dynamic relationship for the past 30 years. It has helped Fiji respond to disaster. In the aftermath of the recent category-five tropical storm, Cyclone Winston, which devastated Fiji last February, the Indonesian government has given the Fiji island nation US$5 million in reconstructive and rehabilitative aid.\nThe government has also pledged to help Fiji rebuild its Queen Victoria School by deploying engineer troops. It has also offered cooperation in areas of fisheries, food security and general disaster mitigation. In helping Fiji develop its agriculture sector, Indonesia has also sent 100 hand tractor units to aid the Fiji government.\nAnother Pacific nation, Papua New Guinea, has also enjoyed positive relations with Indonesia. In April this year, Rimbink Pato, Papua New Guinea’s foreign affairs and immigration minister, said that both countries had signed 11 memorandums of understanding and three corporate arrangements that spanned issues such as economic cooperation and politics.\nThe ministers of both countries have also discussed security arrangements, intelligence sharing and working in close cooperation on the border.\nThroughout the years, Indonesia’s work with its neighbors in the Pacific region has also resulted in a number of influential intergovernmental sub-regional organizations, such as the Pacific Islands Forum (PIF), the Melanesian Spearhead Group (MSG), the Southwest Pacific Dialogue (SWPD), the Coral Triangle Initiative on Coral Reefs, Fisheries and Food Security (CTI-CFF) and the Pacific Islands Development Forum (PIDF).\nAmong the most notable of the organizations is the MSG, which began in 1988 as a means to promote economic cooperation among Melanesian nations – Fiji, Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu. Indonesia was recognized as an associate member in 2015, after initially being accepted as an observer in 2011.\nThe relationship between Indonesia and the MSG countries is not simply economic. Indonesia in the past has used its common cultural background with these Melanesian countries to strengthen bilateral relations.\nIndonesia has 11 million people of Melanesian descent spread across provinces such as Maluku and East Nusa Tenggara.\nIn fact, according to Vice Minister of Foreign Affair A. M Fachir, increased connectivity between Melanesians in Indonesia and the MSG nations could pave the way for broader access to the Indonesian market.\n“Stronger connectivity will create wider opportunities,” Desra added.\n“To answer this challenge, Indonesia is pushing for a meeting of the SWPD Group on Connectivity under the leadership of Papua New Guinea to discuss strengthening connectivity between Indonesia and the Pacific, especially the Southwest Pacific.”\nIn 2014, Indonesia and the MSG nations also agreed on a nine-paragraph joint statement that identified potential venues for cooperation in fields such as food security, education, democracy, good governance and social and cultural issues.\nThe country’s desire to improve cooperation extends to the natural world as well. In 2009, during the World Ocean Conference, Indonesia spearheaded the CTI-CFF with countries like Malaysia, the Philippines and Papua New Guinea.\nAside from protecting nature, Indonesia has also used the CTI-CFF as a way of fighting against illegal, unregulated and unreported fishing, and to have it classified as a Transnational Organized Crime.\nThis decades-long history of cooperation between Indonesia and the Pacific nations has all been part of Indonesia’s diplomacy goal of building good relations with all of its neighbors and maintaining a stable, prosperous and secure regional neighborhood, which in turn is crucial for Indonesia’s own security, development and prosperity.\n“Indonesia has an interest in pushing for stronger political stability and economic growth in the Pacific by playing its role in building bridges to Southeast Asia,” Desra said.\n&nbsp;\nMINISTRY OF COMMUNICATION AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get ‘closer to the people’: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Article\nNavigating Indonesia-US relations amid global and domestic changes\nMegawati supports free meals program, with caveat\nJapan seeks Indonesia’s help to solve labor crisis\nRussia teams up with BRICS to create AI alliance\nIndonesia must regain credibility as an honest broker\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get ‘closer to the people’: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nMore in Front Row\nView more\nFront Row\nThink Business, Think Hong Kong: Spotlighting Asia opportunities in Jakarta\nFront Row\nBPJS Kesehatan partners with stakeholders to build a fraud-free JKN ecosystem\nFront Row\nFore Coffee ends the year strong with hopeful prospects and locally focused products\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo’s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nAcademia\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?\nAcademia\nStop with the LGBTQ scapegoating\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities"

No problem, as most photo applications come with an auto or semi-auto color balancing feature.\nAre your hands too shaky when taking photos so the results are blurred pictures? Then just give them more artsy effects using Instagram and within seconds you will have obscure high-quality photos that hipsters would love.\nWith that in mind, what then separates true professional photographers from the picture-and-selfie-snapping commoners?\nPhotography expert Markus Schaden said this is where the photo book culture comes into play.\n“Everybody can take part and make photos. This means how do we deal with all these images? The best practice is, for sure, if you put them into a book. By doing this, you can make them into a story, a documentation or whatever you want,” Schaden told The Jakarta Post in a recent interview.\n“You can make it [your photo book] into a PDF and print it as a physical book. The digital things actually help the analog version because it makes it easier for photos to be printed and to be shared.”\nFor Schaden, although technology helped photographers greatly when it came to publishing their photo books, the aspect of having a physical paper versions of them remained relevant in the digital age.\n“For the human being, the love of paper is a long story. It is a story that is a few hundred years old. The physical book is an object that you can touch and feel and it always offers more sensitivity than the digital version. The young generation might not have the same sentiments toward other kinds of books but they are totally crazy in the photography section for the physical version,” Schaden said.\nSchaden, who is from Germany, has more than 20 years of experience in photo book publishing. In 1995, he founded schaden.com, a publisher and a bookshop specializing in photo books.\nSo far, schaden.com has published over 100 photo books and participated in hundreds of international festivals, congresses and photographic events.\nSchaden was also the vice-president of the German Society of Photography (DGPh), a member of the editorial board of the FOAM magazine and a jury member at numerous photo festivals, including Arles, Paris, Krakow, Amsterdam and Los Angeles.\nIn 2014, he founded the PhotoBook Museum, the first ever museum devoted to international photography book exhibitions.\nSchaden has visited Indonesia numerous times in the past to conduct workshops on photo books for photographers. This year, with the support of the Goethe Institut, the Pannafoto Institute, the Japan Foundation and Afterhours Books, he returns for his third photo book workshop.\n“The first workshop gave inspiration. After it was done, we set up a Facebook group a few thousand people joined. The community grew bigger and in the next workshop, there was a lot of enthusiasm,” he said.\nFor the current workshop, Schaden said he would bring new ideas and would discuss more than just how to make a photo book.\n“The workshop also includes the general view on photo books, on photography, on how we archive and on how we produce,” he said.\nThe workshop is actually a part of a photo book exhibition held by Goethe. The exhibition, which runs until Nov. 13 in Jakarta, features hundreds of high-quality and selected photo books from Germany, Indonesia and Japan.\nThe exhibition also features two public discussions, with the first one on Nov. 5 focused on books as part of visual culture, while a week later photographer Romi Perbawa and Lans Bramantyo of Afterhours Books will disclose the creation process behind The Riders of Destiny photo book.\nLans said he hoped the exhibition, workshop and discussions would inspire more Indonesian photographers to start working on their photo books. “If you are not inspired to create your own photo book, then you are not a true photographer,” he said.\n— Photo by\nJP/Jerry Adiguna\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get ‘closer to the people’: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Articles\nNavigating Indonesia-US relations amid global and domestic changes\nMegawati supports free meals program, with caveat\nJapan seeks Indonesia’s help to solve labor crisis\nRussia teams up with BRICS to create AI alliance\nIndonesia must regain credibility as an honest broker\nRelated Article\nNavigating Indonesia-US relations amid global and domestic changes\nMegawati supports free meals program, with caveat\nJapan seeks Indonesia’s help to solve labor crisis\nRussia teams up with BRICS to create AI alliance\nIndonesia must regain credibility as an honest broker\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get ‘closer to the people’: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nMore in News\nView more\nOpinion\nAnalysis: Govt adopts mandatory B35 biodiesel program as CPO prices tumble\nBusiness\nGlobal chip crunch stunts Indonesia car sales recovery\nBusiness\nXL profit falls in Q3 as tower sale income dries\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo’s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nAcademia\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?\nAcademia\nStop with the LGBTQ scapegoating\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities"

Sheng Guangzu, right,  Chinese State Councillor Wang Yong, second right, and Chinese Ambassador to Indonesia Xie Feng, third right, during the groundbreaking ceremony for the construction of its railway in Cikalong Wetan, West  Java, Indonesia, Thursday, Jan. 21, 2016.  (AP Photo/Dita Alangkara)\nI\nn light of the recent increase in Chinese presence in Natuna waters, critics and scholars alike have called on the Indonesian government to break its silence and assert its own legally-backed claims over Indonesia’s exclusive economic zone (EEZ).\nWhile China considers the Natuna Islands to be part of its “traditional fishing grounds”, Indonesia holds legal sovereignty based on the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). However, neither side&nbsp;have&nbsp;stated specific territorial claims, leading some to wonder what imperatives have kept Indonesia from taking a firmer stance on the issue.\nThis event marks Indonesia’s entry into the South China Sea debate, almost a decade after the territorial fiasco between China, Vietnam, Malaysia, and the Philippines began. And just as the country remained silent on the Spratly&nbsp;Islands&nbsp;dispute, so too has Indonesia taken a “non-claimant” stance on the Natuna issue. Researcher Evan Laksmana described Indonesia’s position as akin to a “hollow neutrality” --&nbsp;one that China echoes with great ambiguity, and one that has only recently been questioned.\nIndeed, this event comes as a striking change in direction for China-Indonesia relations, largely due to how Indonesia remained (much to China’s favor) “neutral” during the SCS debacle, in addition to the&nbsp;recent&nbsp;groundbreaking of a China-financed Indonesian high-speed rail (HSR) project. It thus seems curiously contradictory that China acts as both a benevolent neighbor and a regional superpower - assisting Indonesia’s development while simultaneously threatening its territorial sovereignty.\nThis analysis proposes that China’s economic assertiveness and Indonesia’s supposed neutrality regarding the SCS are somewhat interlinked, and that future Indonesian policy should be viewed under this consideration.\n&nbsp;\nChinese economic investment in Indonesia\nChina’s “One Belt One Road” initiative positioned Indonesia as the largest Southeast Asian recipient of China’s foreign infrastructure investment, amounting to about $87 billion in repayable loans. Rather controversially beating Japan, China recently won the contract to build Indonesia’s first HSR project between Jakarta and Bandung, investing $5.5 billion without requiring a guarantee from the Indonesian government.\nAccording to Xie Feng, the Chinese ambassador to Indonesia, the HSR project represents a “major breakthrough in international capacity and equipment cooperation” between the two nations - a landmark agreement representing the win-win nature of China’s ambitious “One Belt One Road” initiative.\nBut for China, investing in foreign infrastructure projects is not so much a politicized tactic as it is an economic necessity. The nation’s railway industry has reached a critical economic juncture: China’s own railway networks are already highly developed, and its production surpluses create an imperative to expand its customer base to countries like Indonesia. This perhaps explains the strong economic ties China has built with several ASEAN nations.\nThis is not to say that China’s economic assistance is entirely apolitical in nature. Critics claim that China’s recent investments&nbsp;in infrastructure&nbsp;are mere diplomatic attempts to ease tensions between ASEAN member states.\nOthers see it as an attempt to find a line of influence - an opening in the Southeast Asian region. After all, a central hallmark of Chinese foreign policy is reciprocity, and it seems that China will only testify to its “good neighborhood” approach so long as its territorial claims in the SCS remain uncontested.\nDiplomatically speaking, China emphasizes a “common destiny” approach of coercive connectivity that opposes the ASEAN norm of mutual noninterference. China capitalizes on this noninterference by building bilateral relationships with individual ASEAN countries - leaving its expansion policies largely uncontested by ASEAN neighbors.\nAs a result, the “China Threat” involves the expectation of reciprocation in the political sphere that China demands of its economic recipients. The low level of mutual political trust and fear of Chinese hegemony is in fact secondary to the quiet realization that the “high speed” diplomacy has unwritten obligations.\n&nbsp;\nThe litmus test: So far so good?\nWilmar Salim and Siwage Negara from the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies, posit that China’s investment in Indonesian infrastructure can be seen as an economic “litmus test”.&nbsp;But the litmus test goes beyond economic viability; the HSR project is also a litmus test for the structural legacy of what Chinese infrastructural investments leave behind.\nIn particular, the proposition of building a “common destiny” leaves neither intellectual expertise nor local manufacturing facilities, reflecting what Hong Yu of the USC US-China Institute describes as China’s competitive, rather than complementary, relationship with its ASEAN counterparts.\nThe politicized premise behind China’s foreign economic investments is thus not as altruistic as it seems, and the inherent danger is in assessing the “win-win” results of the “One Belt One Road” initiative solely by its economic outcomes.\nThe fallacy is in using the HSR project itself as a litmus test - and thereby a source of justification - to assess the political soundness of China’s influence on Indonesia. After all, wouldn’t such a fallacy likewise justify and encourage Indonesia to maintain its indifference toward the SCS debate?\nThe question of Indonesia’s silence lies beyond China exerting its political prowess under the guise of economic benevolence. Instead, Indonesia should be more concerned with its supposed neutrality regarding the China-Indonesia HSR project, as well as the illusory perception that the HSR project is mutually exclusive from the SCS fiasco.\nThis is not to say that Indonesia should be wholly condemned for its silence; the debate on territorial sovereignty remains integral, but the antithesis to that indifference is far from the solution. In order for Indonesia to find its compromise, critics must first acknowledge the reasons behind the government’s current silence.\nMuch like how the Jakarta’s High Speed Rail project is far from being politically neutral, so too is Indonesia’s supposedly “neutral” response tainted with color.\n&nbsp;\n***\nJulius Utama is a student in New York University's Department of Applied Psychology, with research concentrations in Sociology and Communications.

President Joko \"Jokowi\" Widodo inaugurated the renovated-airport on Wednesday. Government aims to boost tourist arrivals in Aceh with the airport expansion. (Antara/Septianda Perdana)\nTo the people of Aceh,\nNext February, you will all have the opportunity to cast your vote for a new governor and other local representatives. As a sense of expectation builds around the elections, so too does our sense of concern: that the elections will again see the violence and intimidation that damaged the election process of 2012.\nHaving gone through decades of war and then achieved peace and “self-government”, you deserve better than to see the democratic promise of the 2005 Helsinki peace accord buried by another round of less-than-democratic elections.\nAs participants in that historic agreement and as dear friends of the Acehnese, we believe it would be a betrayal of everything the Free Aceh Movement (GAM) and the referendum movement struggled for.\nThe agreement, or MoU, signed between GAM and the government of Indonesia, was intended to end the power of the gun in Aceh; this was a commitment by GAM and the Indonesian government. It aimed to bring peace to Aceh – not just an end to the fighting between the&nbsp;Acehnese Military (TNA) and the Indonesian Military (TNI) – but peace, to all Acehnese in all circumstances.\nThe agreement was intended to allow you to determine your destiny through free and fair elections. It was not meant to exchange one form of violence and intimidation by Indonesia for violence and intimidation by Acehnese themselves, to let one group of Acehnese or another force people to vote their way.\nThe agreement was intended to ensure that Aceh’s political leaders listened to the wishes of the Acehnese, and reflected those preferences in policies that benefited the great mass of Acehnese, not just the presumptive leaders.\nThe peace agreement was based on the idea that political issues within Aceh should be resolved through the ballot box and the many other means available in a democracy. To assert the fullest measure of democracy possible within the Republic of Indonesia, the peace agreement gave you, the people of Aceh, the historic and unprecedented right to your own political parties.\nDuring the talks in Helsinki, the Indonesian government offered GAM – in exchange for its cooperation in ending the independence struggle – sole political control of Aceh, the right to be the only Acehnese party. The GAM negotiating team, to which we were advisors, rejected that offer. Instead, GAM wisely insisted that the Acehnese had the right to choose their representatives democratically and to form as few or as many political parties as they so chose.\nIn GAM’s rejection of taking power without being democratically elected, and instead giving political power to the people of Aceh, GAM embraced the central Islamic principle of achieving peace through justice. By the use of force and intimidation in the 2012 elections, some of our beloved friends contradicted this noble principle and damaged the high promise of peace. The 2017 elections cannot be allowed to deepen that damage.\nNo group of Acehnese should be permitted to bully its way to power. It would be a betrayal of the goals of the Helsinki accord and of all that GAM, Aceh province (DIA) and the Acehnese struggled for.\nDuring 2012 electioneering, some of the very men who fought for Aceh’s freedom turned to force and intimidation, and to attacking other candidates as traitors to the cause. They attacked and even killed members of other parties, fellow men of GAM. At the swearing-in of the current governor and vice-governor, the former governor, a GAM man, was beaten up by other GAM men.&nbsp;We felt ashamed that former brothers-in-arms, people we knew and lived with during the war, would do such things.\nThose elections, unfortunately, demonstrated that guerrilla leaders who are good at war often have difficulty accepting democratic methods in times of peace. Used to giving orders and using force and violence for a collective cause, they have a hard time respecting people who challenge them when times have changed; when the common cause is the democratic process itself.\nNow, for there to be justice, for the men and women of GAM to continue the struggle for justice, political leaders and supporters must listen to the democratic voice of the people.&nbsp;That voice will never die; it can only be temporarily silenced at the cost of destroying the very thing that GAM won.\nThere is no room for violence and the threat of violence. Those who seek to be leaders in Aceh or participants in Aceh’s future must forswear this, even if that means some other leaders, some other participants, prevail. That is the democracy.\nThe 2017 election must thereby reflect Islam’s commitment to being an abode of peace and goodness. The election must be Halal.\nAny attempt to obtain political benefit through support for or by allowing threats or acts of violence in a place of peace is, and must be seen as by all Acehnese, Haram.\nPeace through justice. Justice through free and fair elections.\nMay peace and justice prevail in Aceh.\n&nbsp;\nPeace be unto you!\n&nbsp;\nProfessor Damien Kingsbury\nWilliam “Abu Billy” Nessen\n&nbsp;\n***\nDamien Kingsbury is professor of international politics at Deakin University, Melbourne, Australia, where he is director of the masters in international and community development.

In that belief, a woman who behaves in accordance to the social norms would not be fallen victim,' she said.\nAti, a Muslim, was a model student in a vocational high school in Sikka who always wore modest clothes and headdress. She stayed in a boarding house, away from her parents and siblings.\nOne Friday in 2009, Ati finished noon prayers when the house owner raped her.\nThe accused turned out to be a regional council member. The case was frozen in court.\nRos, now 22, was a typical rebellious teen who left her parents' house for a punk community. She worked at a hair salon to make ends meet.\nAs she walked back from a late party, she was chased by a group of boys and gang-raped in a deserted alley. Ros recognized one of the offenders as a male friend.\nDuring her subsequent pregnancy, Ros mustered the courage to bring the case to the court, despite intimidation from the defendants aimed at her family. The court ruled in her favor and sent the defendants to jail.\nBravery:\nRos, a survivor of sexual violence, as she speaks to filmmakers about her experience.\nCourtesy of Arts for Women\nThe documentary, directed by Yuda Kurniawan and produced by Caroline Monteiro, backs up data from the National Commission on Violence Against Women (Komnas Perempuan), which reported that gang rapes and rapes committed by public figures or officials were difficult to prosecute.\nIn 2012, the commission said that there were 20 cases of sexual violence against women reported each day in the country and that most offenders were known to the victims, whose average age was between 13 and 18.\n'If there is one thing a rape survivor needs is recognition that a grave crime has taken place,' Valentina said. 'The documentary can serve as a tool for the fight against sexual abuse, because the more we know about it, we can be more sensitive and [are] able to identify and even to prevent the crime.'\nShe criticized the government for not incorporating discussions on a proposed law on sexual violence into its five-year plan until 2019, as previously promised.\nAccording to Valentina, sex crimes such as rape were lumped under 'moral offenses' in the Criminal Code.\nCaroline said that she would bring her project on a road show in NTT before going to other regions. 'I have determined to film the plight of rape survivors during my stay in NTT. I started the production in 2012 and the filming was started last year.'\nFilming took months until Ati and Ros were ready to talk about what they had gone through.\nThe women connected with filmmakers from the Team of Volunteers for Humanity in Flores (TRUK-F) based in Maumere, the capital of Sikka. TRUK-F, led by Sister Eustochia Monika Nata, has provided a safe house and legal support for the women and children survivors of sex crimes since 1999.\n'Either case of Ati and Ros is unique, but they both chose to stand up and fight,' said TRUK-F staffer Maria Hendrika Hungan, or Henny, who accompanied Ati and Ros to the premiere. 'They are the example of rape survivors who have moved forward and continue to reach their dreams and to raise their children.'\nAti lives with a son from a short-lived marriage to a distant relative who abandoned her. Ati, who always wanted to become a teacher, has been given the chance to teach at an elementary school in her hometown although she was yet qualified for the stint.\n'I received lots of help from people who care about me. I have enrolled in an open university and will continue teaching,' said Ati, who read a poem she wrote on stage.\nMeanwhile, Ros said she left her six-year-old girl to be raised by her parents in Maumere as she pursued her dreams of becoming a singer while cleaning houses between voice classes in Bekasi, West Java.\nShe took the stage and the heart of the audience when she sang\n'Takdirku'\n(My Destiny).\n'I couldn't talk about the rape to just anybody. It will still haunt me, but it won't stop me,' said Ros.\nOn screen:\nSister Eustochia Monika Nata as she is interviewed for the documentary.\nCourtesy of Arts for Women\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get ‘closer to the people’: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Article\nNavigating Indonesia-US relations amid global and domestic changes\nMegawati supports free meals program, with caveat\nJapan seeks Indonesia’s help to solve labor crisis\nRussia teams up with BRICS to create AI alliance\nIndonesia must regain credibility as an honest broker\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get ‘closer to the people’: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nMore in News\nView more\nOpinion\nAnalysis: Govt adopts mandatory B35 biodiesel program as CPO prices tumble\nBusiness\nGlobal chip crunch stunts Indonesia car sales recovery\nBusiness\nXL profit falls in Q3 as tower sale income dries\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo’s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nAcademia\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?\nAcademia\nStop with the LGBTQ scapegoating\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities"

In just a few months, Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) leaders will again meet in Indonesia, Southeast Asia’s largest economy. How far has the region come in achieving those goals and what more needs to be done?\n&nbsp;The headline achievements are impressive. To note just one, incomes in the region have more than doubled since 1994 from an average of US$10,000 to more than $23,000.\nThe journey to where we are today has not been easy. The region has been buffeted by economic crises, first in 1997-1998 and then in 2008-2009. This crisis is not yet over, a number of APEC members recently enacted stimulus measures to kick start growth, such as QE3 in the US and Japan’s new attempt to reflate its economy. There is a possibility of a new stimulus in China in response to a deteriorating external environment.\nThese measures, while focused on domestic growth, have some unintended consequences. We are seeing rising capital flows into Asia that pose challenges, including the need to minimize the risks of asset bubbles and excessive credit expansion. There is already talk of “currency wars” and competitive devaluations. While the rhetoric makes for exciting reading, the world is far too complex for simplistic reasoning.\nAt the outset of the crisis, many had feared a descent into beggar-thy-neighbor polices, but thus far, through the actions of the G20 and APEC, we have avoided this. At this critical juncture, when nationalist sentiments are rising, we need more cooperation and understanding. APEC is the embodiment of bridging differences and must continue to play its role in bringing a diverse community together.\nWhile APEC has done well in terms of freeing up trade and investment, the world that it occupies has changed. In 1994, bilateral trade deals were the exception, today they are the rule.\nEven this is changing. The ASEAN Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership Framework will consolidate the ASEAN+1 agreements into a single area and the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement hopes to build on the Pacific 4 agreement. Outside our region, the US and the EU are talking about a trans-Atlantic trade agreement, which would create the single biggest market in the world.\nThese massive trade groups, while potentially building blocs to multilateralism, can make outsiders feel excluded. This is a dangerous path to go down and this region, through APEC, with its spirit of inclusiveness and openness, should ensure that no economy is left out.\nHowever, strong headline growth has masked a dirty secret — income disparities have been growing both among and within regional economies. APEC leaders have long talked of the need for growth to be equitable — both in Bogor and in recent years such as in 2009 in Singapore — with a call to “foster inclusive growth” and in Yokohama where it was a key dimension of the APEC Growth Strategy.\nThe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) set the objective of universal primary education by 2015. In this region, we should move ahead and aim to provide all our citizens with the skills to participate in this competitive global economy. While some economies have done particularly well in increasing tertiary education participation, for example in South Korea where the ratio has increased from 35 percent to almost universal enrollment since 1994, others lag behind.\nHowever, enrollment rates are not a panacea. One need only look at high unemployment rates among recent graduates in parts of Europe to see this. Emphasis must be on flexibility and resilience. There is a need for educational institutions and businesses to work together to help to develop skills of our peoples to fulfill their potential. This requires a change in culture in both business and education providers.\nEven if our people possess the skills to compete, they cannot do so if they are not connected to the market. We need our people and our businesses — large and small — to be able to connect to where opportunities exist. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) estimates that East Asia alone needs to invest some $8 trillion in infrastructure.\nMuch of this would be in transportation but a critical part of the creative economy is access to information. Access to the Internet varies tremendously in the region, from 2 to 84 in every 100 in Papua New Guinea and South Korea, respectively.\nAnother aspect of the integration process is how do our businesses reap the opportunities that lie ahead? It has been conventional wisdom that multinational corporations account for 70 percent of global trade, while at the same time small and medium enterprises (SMEs) account for 90 percent of all businesses.\nThe idea that products are made in one particular country has given way to the idea of being “made in the world”. The emergence of global value chains opens up opportunities for SMEs to participate, but SMEs face a distinct set of problems going global as trade rules and compliance costs disproportionately impact smaller businesses, and their access to finance and information about overseas markets is limited.\nA focus on these three areas: education, infrastructure and barriers to SME participation, could help make a major difference to addressing APEC’s goals of equitable and inclusive growth in the years ahead. Calls for addressing inequality should not be misconstrued as calls for the redistribution of wealth — that has already been tried and failed. Making growth equitable and inclusive are essential to the region’s goal of community building — that is one in which we share a sense of common destiny and purpose.\nThese issues will be addressed during a conference organized by the Pacific Economic Cooperation Council (PECC), the Singapore National Committee for Pacific Economic Cooperation (SINCPEC) and the Indonesian National Committee for Pacific Economic Cooperation (INCPEC) on Feb. 22-23.\n— Jusuf Wanandi is the co-chair of the Pacific Economic Cooperation Council and vice-chair of the Board of Trustees of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) in Jakarta.\n— Tan Khee Giap is the chair of the SINCPEC and co-director of the Asian Competitiveness Institute (Singapore) at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy, NUS.\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get ‘closer to the people’: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nRelated Articles\nNavigating Indonesia-US relations amid global and domestic changes\nMegawati supports free meals program, with caveat\nJapan seeks Indonesia’s help to solve labor crisis\nRussia teams up with BRICS to create AI alliance\nIndonesia must regain credibility as an honest broker\nRelated Article\nNavigating Indonesia-US relations amid global and domestic changes\nMegawati supports free meals program, with caveat\nJapan seeks Indonesia’s help to solve labor crisis\nRussia teams up with BRICS to create AI alliance\nIndonesia must regain credibility as an honest broker\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get ‘closer to the people’: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nSurviving via 'VCS': Indonesians turn to virtual sex work amid COVID-19\nMore in News\nView more\nOpinion\nAnalysis: Govt adopts mandatory B35 biodiesel program as CPO prices tumble\nBusiness\nGlobal chip crunch stunts Indonesia car sales recovery\nBusiness\nXL profit falls in Q3 as tower sale income dries\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo’s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nAcademia\nConfronting impunity crisis in Southeast Asia\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?\nAcademia\nStop with the LGBTQ scapegoating\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities"

Instead, by an accident of history, Australia has been predominantly populated with Westerners. This historical accident is now coming to an end.\nThe past two centuries of Western domination of world history have been a major historical aberration because from the year 1 to the year 1820, the two largest economies in the world were always Asian (China and India). All historical aberrations come to a natural end. We will return soon to the Asian century, if not the Asian millennium.\nThe one country that will have to make the most painful adjustment to the Asian century is undoubtedly Australia. As Western power slowly but steadily recedes from Asia, Australia could well be left beached, together with New Zealand, as the sole Western entity in Asia. Today, Australia is naturally clinging on to American power for comfort. The deployment of 2,500 Marines in Darwin recently clearly sent a signal that Australia was counting on American security protection.\nYet American power will also recede steadily. Few Americans and Australians are aware of how quickly the American economy will become number two in the world. IMF statistics show that in PPP terms America had a 25 percent share of the global economy in 1980, while China only had 2.2 percent. By 2016, the American share will decline to 17.6 percent while the Chinese share will rise to 18 percent.\nUnder these dramatically changed historical circumstances, the biggest mistake that Australia could make is to continue on auto-pilot, clinging to Western or American power as its sole source of security.\nA strong desire to remain part of the West is perfectly natural. The Australian Foreign Minister, Bob Carr, explained this desire well in his interview with The Straits Times on July 6. “But by language and institutions and values, Australia is undeniably Western and should not apologize for it,” he said. “It is who we are. It makes us interesting and it makes us valuable to all interlocutors... A parliamentary democracy, an independent judiciary, a free press, a focus on human rights — all derive from the Western tradition. The Asian migrants who come here bringing their cultures and their perspectives like it that way.”\nThe logic of cultural identity cannot, however, trump hard geopolitical considerations. Let me make a slightly provocative comparison to drive home that point. The West supported the white minority apartheid government throughout the Cold War because it was seen as a necessary bulwark against Soviet expansion in Africa.\nHowever, as soon as the Cold War ended, South Africa lost its strategic usefulness and was quickly abandoned by the West. Their common cultural roots did not factor in the equation. At the same time, to avoid any misunderstanding, let me stress that Australia, unlike apartheid South Africa, does not sit as a “foreign” object in Asia.\nIt has adapted relatively well over the years to its Asian neighborhood. It enjoys close and friendly relations with many of its Asian neighbors.\nIndeed, Australia has many assets in Asia. First, Australia is a member of the Five Power Defense Arrangements (FPDA) together with Singapore, Malaysia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. Established in 1971, the FPDA has sought to complement the traditional US bilateral alliances and networks, more recent minilateral arrangements, as well as ASEAN’s operations in promoting peace and stability in Southeast Asia. In so doing, Australia, together with the UK and New Zealand, plays a part in sustaining the Southeast Asian security architecture.\nSecond, Australia has carried out a number of education and training projects through the Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID) and other government agencies. In fact, AusAID funds the ASEAN-Australia Development Cooperation Program which helps in the realization of the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) by 2015.\nThe program focuses on building the institutional capacity of ASEC, funding critical economic research and policy activities, and implementing projects that help less developed ASEAN member states operationalize elements of the ASEAN Economic Blueprint.\nIn short, Australia is already playing a pivotal role in raising the quality of education and training among ASEAN member states.\nThird, Australia has cultivated close ties with its Asian neighbors, particularly Japan and Indonesia. Japan and Australia have close economic ties, since Japan is Australia’s largest trading partner and a major source of capital investment. In 2007, Australia and Japan started negotiations on a bilateral free trade agreement. Both countries have also cooperated in the areas of culture, tourism, defense and scientific cooperation.\nAustralia also has generally good ties with Indonesia. Since the independence of Indonesia, both countries have cooperated in the areas of fisheries conservation, law enforcement, and justice. In June 2006, Indonesia and Australia also concluded a security agreement, known as the Lombok Agreement, to provide a framework for the development of the bilateral security relationship.\nIn 2011-2012, Australia’s assistance to Indonesia was worth an estimated $558 million. Indonesia is Australia’s top recipient of bilateral aid. Both countries also have a healthy trade and economic relationship with two-way trade (merchandise and services) worth $13.8 billion in 2010-11, and two-way investment worth around $5.7 billion in 2010.\nThe importance of the Australian-Indonesian relationship can be summarized in a 1994 speech by Paul Keating in which he said, “No country is more important to Australia than Indonesia. If we fail to get this relationship right, and nurture and develop it, the whole web of our foreign relations is incomplete. [...] The emergence of the New Order government of president Soeharto, and the stability and prosperity which [it] has brought to [Indonesia], was the single most beneficial strategic development to have affected Australia and its region in the past 30 years.”\nThe article is an excerpt from a paper recently submitted at a seminar in Canberra, Australia. The writer, dean of the Lee Kuan Yew school of public policy, National University of Singapore, is former Singapore permanent representative to the United Nations.\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get ‘closer to the people’: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nActivists call for accountability in a year filled with police brutality\nRelated Articles\nNavigating Indonesia-US relations amid global and domestic changes\nMegawati supports free meals program, with caveat\nJapan seeks Indonesia’s help to solve labor crisis\nRussia teams up with BRICS to create AI alliance\nIndonesia must regain credibility as an honest broker\nRelated Article\nNavigating Indonesia-US relations amid global and domestic changes\nMegawati supports free meals program, with caveat\nJapan seeks Indonesia’s help to solve labor crisis\nRussia teams up with BRICS to create AI alliance\nIndonesia must regain credibility as an honest broker\nPopular\nJokowi told PPP to get ‘closer to the people’: Sandiaga\nFewer marriages among young Indonesians hurts wedding industry\nActivists call for accountability in a year filled with police brutality\nMore in News\nView more\nOpinion\nAnalysis: Govt adopts mandatory B35 biodiesel program as CPO prices tumble\nBusiness\nGlobal chip crunch stunts Indonesia car sales recovery\nBusiness\nXL profit falls in Q3 as tower sale income dries\nHighlight\nPolitics\nPrabowo’s suggestion for indirect regional polls lambasted&nbsp;\nArchipelago\nFamilies of Kanjuruhan stadium crush victims seek Rp 17.5b in compensation\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nThe Latest\nView more\nAcademia\nTourism and turmoil: Can Bali survive the price of its own success?\nSociety\nDeputy higher education minister under scrutiny after study tip session\nAcademia\nCan South Koreans protect their democracy?\nRegional Elections\nRidwan Kamil concedes defeat in Jakarta gubernatorial election\nAcademia\nWill your encrypted messages remain private in Europe?\nAcademia\nStop with the LGBTQ scapegoating\nEconomy\nAs the world ages, Indonesia sees business opportunities\nAcademia\nNavigating Indonesia-US relations amid global and domestic changes"
