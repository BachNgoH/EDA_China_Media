Associated Press\nCAPE TOWN, South Africa \u2014 President Joe Biden is finally making his long-promised visit to Africa this week, attempting to showcase a U.S.-backed railway project in three countries that he has pushed as a new approach in countering some of China\u2019s global influence.\nBiden\u2019s first visit to the continent as president \u2014 which he left to the very end \u2014 will highlight the Lobito Corridor railway redevelopment in Zambia, Congo and Angola. It aims to advance U.S. presence in a region rich in the critical minerals used in batteries for electric vehicles, electronic devices and clean energy technologies.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThat\u2019s a key field for U.S.-China competition and China has a stranglehold on Africa\u2019s critical minerals.\nFEATURED STORIES\nGLOBALNATION\nJollibee Group\u2019s inclusive business practice boosts Filipino farmers\u2019 productivity, income\nGLOBALNATION\nTrump taps election denier to head global media operation VOA\nGLOBALNATION\n'Alarming' US mystery drones confound officials, scare locals\nA new strategy\nThe U.S. has for years built relations in Africa through trade, security and humanitarian aid. The 800-mile (1,300-kilometer), $2.5 billion railway upgrade is a different move and has shades of China\u2019s Belt and Road foreign infrastructure strategy that has surged ahead.\nREAD:\nBiden\u2019s promised visit to Africa shows no signs of happening yet\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThe Biden administration has called the corridor one of the president\u2019s signature initiatives.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nBiden starts a three-day trip to Angola on Monday, yet Lobito\u2019s future and any change in the way the United States engages with a continent of 1.4 billion leaning heavily toward China depends on the incoming administration of Donald Trump.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\n\u201cPresident Biden is no longer the story,\u201d said Mvemba Dizolele, the director of the Africa Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington-based think tank. \u201cEven African leaders are focused on Donald Trump.\u201d\nA fit for Trump\u2019s vision?\nThe U.S. has committed hundreds of millions of dollars to the Lobito Corridor alongside financing from the European Union, the Group of Seven leading industrialized nations, a Western-led private consortium and African banks.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\n\u201cA lot is riding on this in terms of its success and its replicability,\u201d said Tom Sheehy, a fellow at the United States Institute of Peace, a nonpartisan federal research institution.\nREAD:\nBiden fetes Kenyan leader as Africa competition grows\nHe called it one of the flagships for the G7\u2019s new Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment, which was driven by Biden and aims to reach other developing nations as a response to China\u2019s Belt and Road.\nBiden promised to visit Africa last year after reviving the U.S.-Africa Summit for the first time in nearly a decade in December 2022. The trip was kicked back to 2024 and delayed again this October because of Hurricane Milton, reinforcing a sentiment among Africans that their continent is still low priority. The last U.S. president to visit was Barack Obama in 2015.\n\u201cAfrica never gets top attention,\u201d said Witney Schniedman, an expert on African economic growth at the nonprofit Brookings Institution.\nBut many are optimistic that the Lobito project, which isn\u2019t due for completion until well after Biden has left office, will survive a change of administration and be given a chance. It goes some way to blunting China, which has bipartisan backing and is high on Trump\u2019s to-do list.\n\u201cAs long as they keep labeling Lobito one of the main anti-China tools in Africa, there is a certain likelihood that it\u2019s going to keep being funded,\u201d said Christian-G\u00e9raud Neema, who analyzes China-Africa relations.\nSome success in Africa\nThe Lobito Corridor will be an upgrade and extension of a railway line from the copper and cobalt mines of northern Zambia and southern Congo to Angola\u2019s Atlantic Ocean port of Lobito, a route west for Africa\u2019s critical minerals.\nIt\u2019s little more than a starting point for the U.S. and its partners, because China is dominant in the mining in Zambia and Congo. Congo has more than 70% of the world\u2019s cobalt, most of which is heading to China to reinforce its critical mineral supply chain that the U.S. and Europe have to rely on.\nLobito was made possible by some American diplomatic success in Angola that led to a Western consortium winning the bid for the project in 2022 ahead of Chinese competition, a surprise given Angola\u2019s long and strong ties with Beijing. China financed a previous redevelopment of the railway.\nThe Biden administration accelerated American outreach to Angola, turning around what was an antagonistic relationship three decades ago when the U.S. armed anti-government rebels in Angola\u2019s civil war. U.S.-Angola trade was $1.77 billion last year, while the U.S. has a stronger stake in regional security through a strategic presence on the Atlantic Ocean, and Angolan President Jo\u00e3o Louren\u00e7o\u2019s role mediating in a conflict in eastern Congo.\nIn Angola, Biden will announce new developments on health, agribusiness, security cooperation as well as the Lobito Corridor, White House officials said on a preview call with reporters.\nThe visit, the first by a sitting U.S. president to Angola, will \u201chighlight that remarkable evolution of the U.S.-Angola relationship,\u201d Frances Brown, a special assistant to the president and senior director for African affairs at the National Security Council, said on a separate call.\nIt will also draw attention to a perennial challenge for America\u2019s value-based diplomacy in Africa. International rights groups have used Biden\u2019s trip to criticize the Louren\u00e7o government\u2019s authoritarian shift. Political opponents have been imprisoned and allegedly tortured, while security and other laws have been passed in Angola that severely restrict freedoms, throwing some scrutiny on Washington\u2019s new African partnership.\nWill the US really show up?\nThose calling for more U.S. presence in Africa say Angola and the Lobito spinoff show what might be achieved, even with China-facing countries, if the U.S. is willing to consistently engage. But they see signs for Africa when China has held a summit with African leaders every three years since 2000, while the US has had just two summits, in 2014 and 2022, and there are no plans for the next one.\nMichelle Gavin, a former U.S. ambassador to Botswana and adviser on Africa to Obama, said that the U.S. had failed to take Africa seriously over multiple administrations, a bipartisan trend. She doesn\u2019t see Biden\u2019s visit and Lobito being a major \u201cinflection point\u201d that will drive a new U.S. focus across Africa.\nYour subscription could not be saved.

This is important as China is Singapore\u2019s second-largest source of fresh fruits and vegetables and its fourth-largest source of seafood.\nWith Donald Trump poised to return to the White House after winning the recent US presidential election, countries including China and Singapore are bracing themselves for stiffer tariffs and trade disruptions.\nAsked about this, Mr Gan said: \u201cThe operating environment going forward is likely to be very challenging and continue to have significant uncertainties.\u201d\nHe pointed out that a stable and secure relationship between China and the US will benefit a small and open economy like Singapore. \u201cWe will encourage the US and China to continue to dialogue and find ways to work together even as they compete with one another,\u201d he said.\nHe also urged Singapore businesses to be nimble and flexible. \u201cBe prepared to adjust our strategy even as the global environment evolves.\u201d\nMr Chan, meanwhile, stressed that Singapore takes a long-term perspective on China.\n\u201cWe look beyond the short-term perturbations. Underlying that is a deep sense of trust and respect for one another,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are also not complacent. We are constantly on the lookout to better understand the latest challenges that China are grappling with, the latest opportunities.\u201d\nYour subscription could not be saved.

Luggage was strewn everywhere. Most of the victims were taken to a state-owned hospital and some to a military one.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nSoldiers, railway staff among the dead\nWasim Baig, a spokesman for the health department and police said over a dozen soldiers and six railway employees were among the dead at the station, where a walk-through gate has been installed to check whether anyone is carrying explosives. Still, there are multiple other entrances to the station without such security.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nA separatist group, the Balochistan Liberation Army, claimed the attack in a statement, saying a suicide bomber targeted troops present at the railway station.

It is a hub for the country\u2019s ethnic Baloch minority whose members say they face discrimination and exploitation by the central government. Along with separatist groups, Islamic militants also operate in the province.\nChinese as targets\nThe BLA mostly targets security forces and foreigners, especially Chinese nationals who are in Pakistan as part of Beijing\u2019s multibillion-dollar Belt and Road Initiative, which is working on major infrastructure projects. The group often demands the halt of all Chinese-funded projects and for workers to leave Pakistan to avoid further attacks.\nYour subscription could not be saved.

But the latter accidentally sends a message to them, with her bandmates giggling to support her sudden move.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nAccording to the P-pop girl group, the scene didn\u2019t have a script. It was them simply joking around and enjoying each other\u2019s company.\nFEATURED STORIES\nENTERTAINMENT\nSofronio Vasquez looks back on Rey Valera's advice after 'The Voice' US win\nENTERTAINMENT\nPriscilla Meirelles wins new beauty title, Teresa Loyzaga fulfills pageantry dreams\nENTERTAINMENT\nSelena Gomez now engaged to Benny Blanco\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to box ourselves into just one concept,\u201d Angela told INQUIRER.net in a one-on-one interview weeks after \u201cWalang Biruan\u2019s\u201d release. \u201cWe want to be diverse. We\u2019re trying different things to grow as artists and find what\u2019s perfect for us.\u201d The group\u2019s leader also noted that the single is a reminder that there\u2019s power in embracing their girly and feminine side.\nWhile KAIA has always been hands-on with their releases \u2014\u201cdumadaan \u2019yan sa butas ng karayom (it goes through a tedious process),\u201d as Alexa and Charice pointed out\u2014their recent single is a glimpse of their future releases.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\n\u201cWalang Biruan (no joke), we want to show that we\u2019re all-rounders. We\u2019re very passionate about our work,\u201d Angela said before taking a moment of silence. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to be told to do something. We do things because we love what we want to do. We have an initiative to do things for our craft.\u201d\nArticle continues after this advertisement\n\u201cNo joke, we\u2019re very hands-on with what we do. All of our releases go through us. Everything must have a touch of KAIA,\u201d Alexa pointed out.\nHopeful, but kind to themselves\nAs they navigate their journey, the quintet finds joy in declaring they \u201cwill make it.\u201d They also enjoy declaring their dreams in public, such as posting on social media or saying at events, \u201csana sumikat na ang KAIA (I hope KAIA becomes famous)\u201d or \u201cKAIA sikat (KAIA is famous).\u201d\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThese acts of manifestation are some of the group\u2019s ways of harnessing their dreams into reality and remaining hopeful. \u201cOf course, we\u2019ll break down first,\u201d Alexa joked when asked how they go through struggles. This moment allowed the group to reiterate that being vulnerable is okay, as long as they remember their goal to \u201cempower people through songs and stories [they] tell.\u201d\n\u201cPeople believe you need to do and be at your best every day. But sometimes, it\u2019s not feasible,\u201d Charice said. \u201cYou need to take a rest. You need to take care of yourself. You need to reserve energy for yourself.\u201d\nKAIA\u2019s Angela, Charice, and Alexa in a concept photo for \u201cWalang Biruan.\u201d Image: X/@KAIAOfficialPH\nSophia agreed with her bandmate\u2019s remark, noting that phones need to be charged. \u201cRest is part of success. Growth is part of success. You can\u2019t keep on going all the time.\u201d\nMutual support has always been a key factor in their journey, with the members being aware of each other\u2019s strengths and weaknesses. \u201cWe fill each other\u2019s gaps,\u201d Angela said, noting it\u2019s a habit of the group to keep tabs on each other at all times. Sophia, on the other hand, noted that \u201cthey came a long way\u201d while following up with, \u201cWhat haven\u2019t we experienced together\u201d with a knowing smile.\n\u201cIn terms of our performances, we know when someone is best for a certain part. We trust this person,\u201d Charice said. \u201cAt the same time, we know if a certain member can only exert this much. This is where we come in. I guess this is how we achieve our goals as a group.\u201d\n\u201cWe make sure that we\u2019re here for each other,\u201d Charlotte said, chiming in. \u201cNo one is left behind. We have to be there for each other. We have to be together. We can\u2019t leave one behind.\u201d\nLooking back at their journey, the members felt they truly had each other\u2019s back while preparing for their first concert in December 2023. At the time, Angela said it was a tough time for the group, with the members even wondering if they could still push through\n\u201cBefore our concert, there was a time where we\u2019re asked if we can still do it,\u201d Charlotte added. \u201cTo be honest, we had moments where we thought if we should stop. But when the girls are then asked about it, we want to keep going. This makes me want to always rely on my members. If they still want to keep going, I will keep going.\u201d\nAside from finding strength in themselves, KAIA relies on the support of their fans (or ZAIA). \u201cWe always think of our ZAIA. Even if 10 of them are left, it\u2019s okay for us. Because they can multiply. And we\u2019ll keep on performing even if one of them will be left,\u201d Angela said.\nThe concert was eventually sold out and KAIA performed for thousands of fans. For Sophia, it was a moment that gave them a \u201cnew sense of motivation.\u201d\n\u201cWe would sometimes wake up thinking if we\u2019re going to be successful. There are days when we wake up feeling unmotivated and we want to give up. But what makes it easier is we\u2019re in a group,\u201d Sophia added. \u201cIf one of us says that we can do it, the remaining members will follow. We get strength from each other.\u201d\nKAIA\u2019s Charlotte and Sophia in a concept photo for \u201cWalang Biruan.\u201d Image: X/@KAIAOfficialPH\nBeing real\nKAIA also believes in the power of being authentic. This includes being true to themselves and addressing issues that matter, such as reminding fans and casual listeners to \u201cbe kind.\u201d\n\u201cWe have to take care of our fans. They are a reflection of us, of who we are, and our character,\u201d Sophia said. \u201cAll P-pop idols have a goal of making P-pop bigger. Let\u2019s not create problems out of something that\u2019s meant to be a problem in the first place. We hope to celebrate each other because one group\u2019s success is success for the P-pop community.\u201d\nAside from \u201ccreating awareness and allowing themselves to be authentic,\u201d Angela hopes KAIA will be remembered as a girl group that empowers fans to keep pushing for their dreams and celebrating who they truly are.\n\u201cWe realized that we became KAIA because we have the strength to move forward despite the challenges. We can power through if we\u2019re together,\u201d she said. \u201cWe receive messages from fans saying, \u2018Because of your music, I can do my best.\u2019 For me, KAIA is not just a group. It is a connection with our fans. We have a clear vision and message that you can do it.\u201d\nKAIA in a concept photo for \u201cWalang Biruan.\u201d Image: X/@KAIAOfficialPH\nWhile her bandmates nodded in agreement, Sophia emphasized that they want to be \u201caccepted for who they are.\u201d For KAIA, they had several mistakes throughout their careers, but these moments didn\u2019t hold them back from powering through. \u201cI used these to motivate me. It made me who I am. I always return to my mistakes as a way of seeing them as a stepping stone.\u201d\nYour subscription could not be saved.

        "content": "Who\u2019s more valuable to Southeast Asia: its immediate neighbor China, or the other superpower across the Pacific, the United States?\nThere\u2019s an undeniable rivalry between the two in their multifaceted relations with the region, and for good reason. The Switzerland-based World Economic Forum describes Asean\u2014the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations\u2014as the world\u2019s \u201ceconomic dark horse.\u201d Its combined population of 685 million makes it the third-largest market in the world, next to India and China. It thus wields demographic power and is now acknowledged as a driver of the global economy.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThe Asean countries share a common geography and ethnicities, but the economic disparities among them are wide. Average income in the richest member Singapore ($91,100 in 2023) is 77 times that in the poorest member Myanmar ($1,180). Price stability ranges from very stable (with Brunei\u2019s and Thailand\u2019s annual inflation rates of 0.4 and 1.2 percent, respectively) to hyperinflationary (Laos with 31.2 and Myanmar with 27.1 percent). The jobs situation ranges from virtual full employment in Cambodia and Thailand, with unemployment rates of 0.5 and 1.0 percent this year, to Indonesia\u2019s 5.3 percent. Exports-to-GDP ratio ranges from dynamic Singapore\u2019s 108.9 percent to inward-looking Philippines\u2019 measly 12.7 percent (regional average is 55.9 percent). Education outcomes range from globally top-ranked Singapore to bottom-dwellers Philippines and Cambodia (77th and 81st, respectively) in the 2022 Programme for International Student Assessment or Pisa. With such wide disparities, it would be ideal if the US and China help the region with a \u201crising tide that lifts all boats\u201d so that the wide inequalities both across and within countries in Asean could somehow be narrowed.\nFEATURED STORIES\nOPINION\nRoque arrest serves ends of justice\nOPINION\nMAGA\nOPINION\nIs our ICC case dependent on insider witnesses?\nI was invited last week to a candid dialogue in Thailand on how China and the US are helping Southeast Asia. My assigned focus was on their economic contributions to the region. These come via trade, investment, economic assistance, tourism, labor migration, and more. I focused on the first three, which are the most prominent elements in the relationship, and for which data are readily available.\nChina is Asean\u2019s largest trading partner, which is not surprising being right next door. Even so, the US actually took the lead from China early this year as the biggest buyer of Asean\u2019s exports, even from the other side of the world. Trade balance with the US has consistently been in Asean\u2019s favor, with a $200-billion trade surplus; that is, Asean sells more to the US than it buys from it, by that much. The reverse is true with China, which sells more to Asean than it buys, by about $100 billion, and this Asean trade deficit with China has grown tenfold since 2010, in an increasingly lopsided trade.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nAs to foreign direct investments, the US is Asean\u2019s largest source, with $74.4 billion in FDI inflows in 2023. China comes in fourth with FDI flows of $17.3 billion, behind the European Union\u2019s $24.9 billion and Asean cross-investments of $21.9 billion. American investments have been shifting to Asean since the US-China trade war and the COVID-19 pandemic led American manufacturers in China to shift out or add back-up factories in Asean, to the great benefit of the region.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nChina\u2019s economic assistance comes mainly as soft loans for large infrastructure projects under the Belt and Road Initiative. In 2021, it pivoted to a Global Development Initiative promoting \u201cpeople-centered, high-quality, green, and innovation-driven development.\u201d The US Agency for International Development delivers a smaller but comprehensive package of grant assistance covering a wide range of areas including governance, education, health care, agriculture, manufacturing, renewable energy, digital economy, trade facilitation, and workforce development\u2014all aimed to support economic growth, poverty reduction, and sustainable development in Asean. US grants and soft loans uphold labor and environmental standards, transparency, accountability, and human rights, which some see as intrusive conditionalities. While Chinese soft loan projects have no such \u201cstrings\u201d attached, they provoke concerns about a lack of labor and environmental safeguards, looming \u201cdebt traps,\u201d and the prospect of giving up state assets in the event of default. Their assistance with connectivity infrastructure is also feared to carry the risk of data security, cyber-espionage, and over-dependence.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThere are pros and cons on each side. But rather than see it as a contest for the region, the dialogue agreed that complementation or even cooperation, rather than competition, would be in the best interest of Southeast Asia, and in turn, the world. However, current geopolitical realities make this little more than wishful thinking.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\ncielito.habito@gmail.com\nYour subscription could not be saved.

(Photo by GREG BAKER / AFP)\nModest approach\nChina coordinates much of its overseas lending under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), the massive infrastructure project that is a central pillar of Xi\u2019s bid to expand his country\u2019s clout overseas.\nThe BRI made headlines for backing big-ticket projects in Africa with opaque funding and questionable impacts.\nBut China has been shifting its approach in the past few years, analysts said.\nIt has increasingly funnelled money into smaller projects, from a modestly sized solar farm in Burkina Faso to a hydropower project in Madagascar and broadband infrastructure in Angola, according to Boston University\u2019s researchers.\n\u201cThe increased volume of loans signals Africa\u2019s continued importance to China, but the type of loans being deployed are intended to let Africans know that China is taking African concerns into account,\u201d Engel told AFP.\nThis does not mean that Beijing is \u201cpermanently retrenching its investments and provision of development finance to the continent\u201d, Zainab Usman, director of the Africa Program at the US-based Carnegie Endowment for International Peace said.\n\u201cDevelopment finance flows, especially lending, (are) now starting to rebound,\u201d she said.\nNo \u2018debt traps\u2019\nAfrican leaders have this week secured deals with China on a range of sectors including infrastructure, agriculture, mining and energy.\nWestern critics accuse China of using the BRI to enmesh developing nations in unsustainable debt to exert diplomatic leverage over them or even seize their assets.\nA chorus of African leaders \u2014 as well as research by leading global think tanks like London\u2019s Chatham House \u2014 have rebuked the \u201cdebt trap\u201d theory.\n\u201cI don\u2019t necessarily buy in the notion that when China invests, it is with an intention of\u2026 ensuring that those countries end up in a debt trap,\u201d South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said in Beijing on Thursday.\nOne analyst agreed, saying that for many Africans, China has \u201cbecome synonymous\u201d with life-changing roads, bridges and ports and the debt-trap argument ignores the \u201cpositive impact\u201d Beijing has had on infrastructure development on the continent.\n\u201cThe reality is some (African) countries have had a tough time fulfilling their debt repayment commitments due to a multiplicity of factors,\u201d Ovigwe Eguegu, a policy analyst at consultancy Development Reimagined, said.\nEngel, of the Boston University research centre, said the argument mistakenly assumes that \u201cChina solely has short-term objectives in Africa\u201d.\nYour subscription could not be saved.

MVP revives Smart Money\nBUSINESS\nFilipinos urged to go digital in giving Christmas cash gifts\nHowever, China\u2019s investment in the continent has been slammed by critics who accuse the BRI of saddling countries with exorbitant debt or funding projects that damage the environment.\nHere AFP takes a look at five key BRI projects in Africa:\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nKenya\u2019s incomplete railway&nbsp;\nKenya\u2019s Standard Gauge Railway \u2014 built with finance from Exim Bank of China \u2014 connects the capital Nairobi with the port city of Mombasa, and has cut journey times from 10 hours to four since opening in 2017.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nAt $5 billion, it is the country\u2019s most expensive infrastructure project since it won independence more than 60 years ago.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nBut a second phase meant to continue the line to Uganda never materialised as both countries struggled to pay down BRI debts.\nREAD:\nChina promises investment in impoverished Sierra Leone\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThe project was also beset with corruption allegations, and environmental campaigners have taken issue with the route, which cuts through a wildlife park.\nKenya\u2019s President William Ruto last year asked China for a $1 billion loan and the restructuring of existing debt to complete other stalled BRI construction projects.\nThe country now owes China more than $8 billion.\nPort facilities in Djibouti\nAfter China established its first permanent overseas naval base in Djibouti in 2016, it also helped develop the east African country\u2019s nearby Doraleh multi-purpose port.\nThe reportedly $590 million military base is strategically placed between the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden.\nBeijing has said the base is used to resupply navy ships, support regional peacekeeping and humanitarian operations, and combat piracy, though its proximity to a US military base has raised concerns of espionage.\nDoraleh, meanwhile, is partly owned by China Merchants Port Holdings, but the conglomerate\u2019s 23.5 percent stake raised eyebrows when it was awarded after the Djiboutian government seized control of the container terminal from UAE-based DP World.\nDP World claims it was forced out to allow China Merchants to take over.\nAfrica\u2019s longest suspension bridge\nAccording to state broadcaster CCTV, BRI investment in Africa has helped build over 12,000 kilometres (7,500 miles) of road and railway track, around 20 ports, and more than 80 power facilities.\nIn Mozambique, China Road and Bridge Corporation built Africa\u2019s longest suspension bridge, connecting the capital Maputo with its suburb of Katembe.\nPreviously, the quickest way across the Bay of Maputo was by ferry. Road travel required driving 160 kilometres on unpaved roads susceptible to flooding.\nThe bridge, which opened in 2018, cost an estimated $786 million, 95 percent of which was financed by Chinese loans.\nBut critics have suggested the project was overpriced and that interest rates on loans are excessive.\nMinerals in Botswana and beyond\nIn recent years, BRI investment in Africa has shifted to mining the minerals needed to fuel China\u2019s high-tech and green industries, such as electric vehicles.\nIn 2023, China invested $7.8 billion in mining in Africa, according to US-based think tank the American Enterprise Institute.\nThat includes a $1.9 billion deal, reached last year, by state-owned MMG to buy the Khoemacau mine in Botswana, one of the world\u2019s largest copper mines.\nIn July, Chinese firm JCHX Mining Management agreed to buy Zambia\u2019s indebted Lubambe copper mine for just $2.\nChina has also invested in cobalt and lithium mines in Zambia, Namibia and Zimbabwe.\nBut regional conflicts have proved an occasional barrier to Chinese investments. In July this year, authorities suspended all mining in part of the Democratic Republic of Congo, including where Chinese companies operate, to \u201crestore order\u201d there.\nCoal and clean power\nChinese funding in Africa has included dozens of investments in power generation, leading to criticism of the BRI\u2019s environmental impact.\nIn Kenya, Chinese companies were contracted in 2015 to build a coal-fired power plant close to the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Lamu old town.\nBut Kenya\u2019s government cancelled the project in 2020 after protests and opposition to its environmental impact.\nIn 2021, Chinese President Xi Jinping announced China would no longer support the construction of coal power plants abroad.\nIn July that year, Chinese funders pulled support from the $3 billion Sengwa coal project in Zimbabwe.\nInstead, Chinese backers have funded the expansion of the country\u2019s Kariba Hydroelectric Power Station, for $533 million.\nChinese firms have accelerated investments in renewable energy projects. In Nigeria, Chinese loans are part-funding the $4.9 billion construction of the Mambilla hydroelectric plant, which will be the country\u2019s largest power station.\nYour subscription could not be saved.

        "content": "Unrequited Love: Duterte\u2019s China Embrace\u201d by Marites Da\u00f1guilan Vitug and Camille Elemia (Ateneo University Press, 2024) is not a bitter-sweet story about a lovelorn politico from a banana republic told with allegorical flourish. It is a horror investigative story backed by research, interviews, voluminous documents, published and broadcast news reports that show how an elected president had flung his sovereign nation into the arms of a covetous bully nation across the West Philippine Sea (WPS). At what cost? What had we lost?\nIn her back cover blurb, Sen. Risa Hontiveros does not mince words: \u201cA damning record of the former president\u2019s long-running relationship with China, [the book] makes a case for Rodrigo Duterte\u2019s betrayal of the Filipino people.\u201d\nIn her preface, Da\u00f1guilan Vitug\u2019s states the whys: \u201cWhere was Duterte coming from? How did he demonstrate his affection for China and how was this reciprocated? What was the impact of this pendulum swing on sectors such as the military and the defense and foreign affairs departments, institutions that had clear geostrategic moorings? What did this mean for the rule of law and our maritime dispute with China?\u201d\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThe book exposes the overt and covert maneuvers of an Asian bully nation, enabled and emboldened by a China-smitten Filipino president, to aggressively intrude into not only Philippine geographical territory but into other aspects of Philippine life\u2014politics, the military, economics, media, communications, infrastructure, culture, name it.\nFEATURED STORIES\nOPINION\nRoque arrest serves ends of justice\nOPINION\nMAGA\nOPINION\nIs our ICC case dependent on insider witnesses?\nPublic officials, government bureaucrats, think tanks, patriotic garden-variety sleuths and citizens who care about this country\u2019s future should read the book and then act and be vigilant. Warning: On the cover is a doppelganger.\nHere was a national leader enamored with the leader of another nation (China) he put his own at a disadvantage while bad-mouthing a long-time ally (the United States of America) for personal reasons that I may describe as fits of childish pique and disaffection (Chapter 1, \u201cRoots of Affection\u201d).\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nDuterte\u2019s amorous protestations in 2018: \u201cI just simply love Xi Jinping. He understands my position and he is willing to help \u2026 More than anybody else at this time of our national life, I need China.\u201d In 2019: \u201cI love China.\u201d\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThus his \u201cpivot toward China\u201d declared in the early days of his presidency. Thus began the Philippines\u2019 descent into a bottom corner of the relationship. The word \u201cunrequited\u201d means that \u201clove\u201d is lopsided if not exploitative, leaving the pursuing lover\u2019s people in a position of weakness that has yet to be reversed.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nDivided into six parts of 16 chapters, \u201cUnrequited Love\u201d chronicles how the descent worsened with the COVID-19 pandemic and the Duterte government\u2019s shameless favoring of China-made vaccines and health equipment that made local manufacturers cry out for help. Soon the corrupt Pharmally deal was uncovered and so was the Chinese matrix of allies, cronies, and scoundrels salivating for quick bucks. That was the tip of the iceberg.\nThere were the China-financed mega projects in Duterte\u2019s \u201cBuild, build, build\u201d program, among them, the Chico River irrigation project in Kalinga despite red flags from the Commission on Audit, and the Kaliwa Dam that would adversely affect indigenous communities in Quezon and Rizal. These looked like a perfect fit in China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative, a global showcase that snared countries into a web of indebtedness and an altered state of katangahan. Read about \u201cthe bridges over troubled waters\u201d and projects that went pffft. Read about how Chinese tycoons built massive drug rehab centers to complement Duterte\u2019s dirty drug war, only for these to be declared near useless by experts.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nIf you are wondering why the hundreds of Philippine offshore gaming operators (Pogos) that have sprouted, spawned crimes, and become suspected hubs of China espionage are not tackled in \u201cUnrequited Love\u201d it is because the book is mainly about Duterte\u2019s foreign policy shift. A book on Pogos, anyone?\nA chapter of high interest to me was about how media practitioners of good and bad standing were also being snared into the Chinese scheme. Travels, scholarships, wine-and-dine enticements until some media people, bloated and MSG-loaded, have become China\u2019s mouthpieces themselves. This is a major, scary issue, if you ask me, especially when seen in the context of the entry of Chinese telecommunications corporations getting a slice of the pie in the sky, our sky. And gaining foothold near military facilities at that.\nExpectedly, several chapters are devoted to the flashpoint that is the WPS where firepower reigns supreme, where David-and-Goliath skirmishes unfold almost daily since Duterte belittled the much-hailed 2016 arbitral ruling that favored the Philippines\u2019 territorial claims as \u201ca mere scrap of paper.\u201d Nations will be watching how the Philippines will rise or sink, its allies notwithstanding.\n\u201cUnrequited Love\u201d is a heartbreaking reportage about a country that was fed into the maw of a fire-breathing dragon.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\nYour subscription could not be saved.

Xi will visit France, Serbia and Hungary this week as Beijing appears to seek a larger role in the conflict between Russia and Ukraine that has upended global political and economic security. Associated Press\nBUDAPEST, Hungary \u2014 Chinese leader Xi Jinping will spend the bulk of his five-day tour in Europe this week in two small countries at the continent\u2019s eastern half, a region that Beijing has used as a foothold for its expanding economic ambitions in Europe.\nFollowing a stop in Paris on Monday to kick off his first European trip in five years, Xi will then travel to Hungary and Serbia, two nations with autocratic leaders that are seen as China-friendly and close to Russian President Vladimir Putin.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nAs mainstream European leaders have pursued more protectionist policies to limit Beijing and Moscow\u2019s reach on the continent, the governments of nationalist conservative leaders Viktor Orb\u00e1n of Hungary and Aleksandar Vu\u010di\u0107 of Serbia have vigorously courted economic ties with China, inviting major investments in infrastructure, manufacturing, energy and technology.\nFEATURED STORIES\nGLOBALNATION\nBamban under Alice Guo late in submitting cash advance vouchers \u2013 COA\nGLOBALNATION\n2 more PH nature reserves tagged of \u2018internationl importance\u2019\nGLOBALNATION\nJollibee Group\u2019s inclusive business practice boosts Filipino farmers\u2019 productivity, income\nREAD:\nChina\u2019s Xi Jinping in France for Macron talks on Ukraine\nAs the first European Union country to participate in Xi\u2019s signature Belt and Road Initiative, Hungary has straddled a middle ground between its membership in the EU and NATO, and an unusual openness to diplomatic and trade relationships with eastern autocracies.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nTam\u00e1s Matura, a China expert and associate professor at Corvinus University in Budapest, said that Hungary\u2019s hosting of major Chinese investments and production sites \u2014 and its agnosticism on doing business with countries with spotty democratic and human rights records \u2014 has opened a crucial door to China within the EU trading bloc.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\n\u201cThe Hungarian government is the last true friend of China in the whole EU,\u201d Matura said. \u201cIt is very important now to the Chinese to settle down in a country that is within the boundaries of the EU \u2026 and is friendly to the Chinese political system.\u201d\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nREAD:\nEU chief says will urge \u2018fair\u2019 China competition in talks with Xi\nOne of the major benefits to China of establishing bases within the EU: avoiding costly tariffs. The European Commission, the bloc\u2019s executive arm, is mulling raising duties on the import of Chinese electric vehicles (EVs) from its current 10% to protect the European auto manufacturing market \u2014 a mainstay for Germany, the 27-member EU\u2019s largest economy.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nYet in December, Hungary announced that one of the world\u2019s largest EV manufacturers, China\u2019s BYD, will open its first European EV production factory in the south of the country \u2014 an inroad into the EU that could upend the competitiveness of the continent\u2019s auto industry.\nThat shift is already visible in Budapest, where one car dealership has begun scaling down its supply of European vehicles and instead introducing models produced by BYD.\nM\u00e1rk Schiller, the strategy and marketing director for the family-owned Schiller Auto Group, said he believes that European carmakers are \u201calready behind\u201d China in transitioning to EV production. His company recently stopped selling cars made by German carmaker Opel, and switched to BYD.\n\u201cThis was a huge shift,\u201d Schiller said.\nUnconfirmed reports suggest that during Xi\u2019s visit to Hungary from Wednesday to Friday, he and Orb\u00e1n will announce another EV manufacturing investment involving China\u2019s Great Wall Motor. Orb\u00e1n\u2019s office didn\u2019t respond to multiple requests for information on the schedule of the visit.\nIn Serbia, to Hungary\u2019s south, China runs mines and factories across the Balkan country, while billions more in infrastructure loans have funded roads, bridges and new facilities.\nHungary and Serbia have an agreement with Beijing to modernize the railway between the countries\u2019 capitals of Budapest and Belgrade, part of a Belt and Road plan to connect with the Chinese-controlled port of Piraeus in Greece as an entry point for Chinese goods to Central and Eastern Europe.\nThe bulk of the project, which after numerous delays is expected to be completed in 2026, is financed through loans from Chinese banks \u2014 the kind of capital that Hungary and Serbia have been eager to utilize.\nAccording to the AidData research lab at William &amp; Mary, a public university in Virginia, Chinese lenders have issued loans worth more than $22 billion to nine countries in Central and Eastern Europe between 2000 and 2021.\nOf that sum, $9.4 billion has gone to Hungary and $5.7 billion to Serbia, dwarfing the totals of other regional countries.\nVu\u010di\u0107 has said he is \u201chonored\u201d that Xi \u2014 whom he often describes as a \u201cfriend\u201d \u2014 is visiting on Tuesday. He said before the visit that Serbia would seek further Chinese investment, particularly when it comes to advanced technologies.\nBut economic analyst Mijat Laki\u0107evi\u0107 said he didn\u2019t expect any major new investment deals, because \u201ceverything that Serbia does with China has already been agreed.\u201d\nHungary, too, has created a favorable investment environment for China, providing generous tax breaks, subsidies and infrastructural assistance to Chinese companies, as well as helping them navigate Hungarian bureaucracy.\n\u201cThey get the red carpets rolled out and they get everything tailor-made by the government. And that is a huge advantage,\u201d said Matura, the China analyst.\nNear Debrecen, Hungary\u2019s second-largest city, construction is underway of a nearly 550-acre (222-hectare), 7.3 billion euro ($7.9 billion) EV battery plant, Hungary\u2019s largest-ever foreign direct investment.\nOrb\u00e1n\u2019s government hopes the factory, run by Chinese battery giant CATL, will make the country a global hub of lithium-ion battery manufacturing in an era where governments are increasingly seeking to limit greenhouse gas emissions by switching to electric cars.\nSuch investments are coming at a time when Hungary\u2019s sluggish economy has been further hindered by record-setting inflation and the freezing of billions in EU funding that has been withheld over Orb\u00e1n\u2019s track record on democracy standards and the rule of law.\nWith EU money at a standstill, Matura said, China has been willing to fill in the gaps in Hungary\u2019s budget.\n\u201cEU funds have almost came to full stop flowing into the Hungarian economy, so now there is a desperate need in Hungary to turn towards other alternatives, other sources of financial capital,\u201d he said.\nOrb\u00e1n has been open about why he has prioritized Chinese investment: his belief that Western economies are declining, and that China is on the rise.\nYour subscription could not be saved.

        "content": "Beijing\u2014With each coming of spring comes the annual conference of the Boao Forum for Asia (BFA), held in China\u2019s island province of Hainan. This year\u2019s theme, \u201cAsia and the World: Common Challenges, Shared Responsibilities,\u201d is a highly relevant one.\nThroughout the world, there is no shortage of challenges: geopolitical conflicts, a sluggish global economy, lackluster trade, not to mention emerging risks from artificial intelligence, and the existential threat of climate change. But if one takes a closer look, region by region, the picture is not all gloom and doom. Asia stands out as a bright spot. This part of the world has enjoyed robust growth for decades and continues to serve as a primary engine for the global economy. It has also avoided major conflicts in recent memory, despite a multitude of contentious issues.\nData from the McKinsey Global Institute show that Asia is now a prominent player in world order, technology platforms, demographic forces, resource and energy systems, and capitalization. The entire region is set to grow at a rate of 4.5 percent in 2024, much higher than the expected global growth, according to an International Monetary Fund forecast.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nWhat is the secret behind the region\u2019s success story? Perhaps it has a lot to do with the distinctly Asian way of doing things. It is a way of respecting each other, building consensus, and accommodating the comfort levels of all parties. It is a way of advocating good neighborliness and friendship, collectively maintaining a peaceful and stable environment for development. It is a way of jointly practicing open regionalism, further liberalizing and facilitating trade and investment, while opposing trade protectionism, decoupling or cutting supply chains.\nFEATURED STORIES\nOPINION\nRoque arrest serves ends of justice\nOPINION\nMAGA\nOPINION\nIs our ICC case dependent on insider witnesses?\nSimply put, the Asian way is a collaborative approach deeply rooted in an oriental philosophy that values peace and harmony, and focuses on building consensus and promoting development. And much has been achieved this way. Numerous railroads, bridges, and factories stand as a strong testament to what can be achieved when everyone pitches in. From the Asean Highway Network and Asean Power Grid under the Master Plan on Asean Connectivity 2025, to China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), Asian countries are synergizing their development strategies to create greater, collective strength for growth. BRI projects like the China-Laos Railway, Port City Colombo and Hambantota International Port in Sri Lanka, and the Jakarta-Bandung High-Speed Rail in Indonesia have not only created local jobs and revenue, but also given a strong boost to regional connectivity.\nThe Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership put in place in 2022 is the world\u2019s largest free trade agreement. It has been instrumental in consolidating Asia\u2019s position as the world\u2019s manufacturing and trade hub. The Global Development Initiative provides Asian countries with another important platform for development cooperation in areas such as poverty reduction, human resource training, industrialization, the digital economy, and green development, all critical to economic development in the 21st century.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nIn a world fraught with challenges, decoupling and fragmentation are pulling countries apart, making it increasingly difficult to form a synergy. Yet what has happened in recent years\u2014despite the pandemic, repercussions from the Ukraine crisis, or the conflict in Gaza\u2014has time and again proven that the whole of humanity is closely intertwined and shares the same future. The more difficult the going gets, the greater the need for countries to stay together, show solidarity, and coordinate with one another.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nIn this lies the future of the world; in this lies the future of Asia. It is critical that Asian countries maintain the Asian way, enhance solidarity and cooperation, and together build a home of peace and strong growth. In so doing, Asia will be able to bring greater certainty to the fluid global environment and inject strong dynamism into the global economy. And at a time of turbulence and change, the Asian way may also prove useful in solving intractable problems in other parts of the world. Having said that, hopefully, more Asian wisdom will come out of this year\u2019s BFA to help find solutions to common challenges in both Asia and the world.\nThe Jakarta Post/Asia News Network\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nYi Xin is an international affairs observer based in Beijing.\nThe Philippine Daily Inquirer is a member of the Asia News Network, an alliance of 22 media titles in the region.\nYour subscription could not be saved.

Indeed, the conflict raging over the West Philippine Sea was not lost on anyone, including this author, but calmed by an almost familiar setting replete with Filipino culture and traditions\u2014that, perhaps, showcase that there are no distinctions to be set aside.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\n\u201cFujian people have been having business with the Philippines since more than a thousand years ago. They know our country and they have had intermarriages with our people, so that they are more comfortable with us,\u201d says George Chua Cham, FFCCCII government liaison committee chair, whose ancestors also hail from the China province.\n\u201cIt seems these controversial border disputes came about only in modern times, especially with the onset of colonialism. In the past, fisherfolk, traders and seafarers of all nations interacted with each other without passports, with the vast expanse of the sea actually uniting them in camaraderie, kinship and brotherhood,\u201d adds Flores.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nCROWNING GLORY A tiny shop near Kaiyuan Temple in Quanzhou offers traditional wear for rent, including this headpiece, to tourists. The belief is that when one wears a floral crown, called Zanhuawei, \u201cin this life, you\u2019ll also be pretty in the afterlife.\u201d\nFrom Xiamen airport, a mall with an all-too-familiar logo of the SM group greets guests upon their entry into the city. Manicured gardens and parks are found in every corner, as a major highway provides unobstructed view of the sea, a la Manila Bay.\nIn early December, temperature usually drops to the mid-teens\u2014just the right formula for a long walk for those accustomed to the tropics. Around the same time this year, Beijing had to endure its longest cold wave in modern history.\nAccording to Fujian officials interviewed, aside from the weather, Filipinos will take a liking to the connectivity that the city and the province, in general, have to offer.\nInterprovince, a bullet train will cut by more than half passengers\u2019 travel time to Fuzhou, the provincial capital, to just over an hour. The CR Fuxing is only the third fastest train in the world, with the first two also belonging to China.\nTHIRD FASTEST TRAIN At a speed of 350 kilometers per hour, the CR Fuxing is just the third fastest in the world. The first and second spots also belong to China.\nRunning at a speed of 350 kilometers per hour, a seat by the window gives a spectacular\u2014at times dizzying\u2014alternate views of the sea, tree-lined mountains and buildings of various shapes and sizes. It\u2019s a showcase of how the Fujian government would describe its advantage over the more popular cities of China: the province offers \u201cmarine culture, ecological civilization and multiculturalism.\u201dA crisscross of modern and ancient\nAside from the rich cuisine\u2014think oyster omelette, spring rolls, fish balls and an array of soup varieties (including \u2018Buddha Jumps Over the Wall,\u2019 a collagen-filled soup of abalone, sea cucumber and various meats so-called because even Buddha would be tempted to splurge on it)\u2014on offer, Fujian also provides an ancient vibe that can easily comingle with the modern.\nSanFangQiXiang, or the Three Lanes and Seven Alleys in Fuzhou, is an Instagram-ready residential block regarded by scholars as a \u201cliving fossil of ancient city street system.\u201d Once an area that housed intellectuals and officials of important standing in the Ming and Qing dynasties, it is now a major tourist spot with a side street offering various curios and food.\nA stone\u2019s throw away is Lin Zexu Memorial, a mix of temple and museum in remembrance of China\u2019s anti-opium hero, whose policies precipitated the Opium War and continued to inspire modern China\u2019s endeavors in the narcotics war.\nNOT TIRESOME One of two five-story pagodas that flank Kai- yuan Temple in Quanzhou, a crucial port on the ancient Mari- time Silk Road, where various beliefs and religions flourished.\nA consistent theme in China\u2019s history is perhaps the pride that its peoples have grown to evolve with in response to subjugation and humiliation over the centuries.\nNot only in Fujian, Luckin outlets are now scattered across China. It was the country\u2019s response to the dominance of Starbucks, which currently numbers around 6,000 versus the homegrown coffee brand\u2019s 10,000 branches.\nIn Quanzhou, which is two hours by bus from Fuzhou, a museum houses the 32-year-old history of Anta, the country\u2019s biggest sportswear company and the world\u2019s third largest in terms of market capitalization (next only to Nike and Adidas). Founded in Fujian, Anta has gained popularity in recent years after signing up big names in world sports while tapping a burgeoning predilection among the young for anything homegrown rooted in national pride.\nPH hero in China\n\u201cMulticulturalism\u201d is another big theme in Fujian\u2019s tourism banner.\nNOT LUNETA The tallest Rizal monument, at 18.61 meters representing the Philippine hero\u2019s birth year, can be found in Jinjiang, Quanzhou.\nWhere else is this most reflected than in Quanzhou, one of the most important ports in the Maritime Silk Road, a sea route that modern China wants to revisit through its Belt and Road Initiative.\nWowing the likes of explorers Marco Polo and Ibn Battuta, Quanzhou was an important trading hub that allowed various religions and beliefs to flourish.\nEven FFCCCII\u2019s Cham could only quip they had no concept of racism and discrimination in those days. A tombstone unearthed in recent years showed Buddha with angel wings and a mix of other religious elements, such as Hinduism surrounding it. Meanwhile, in the middle of the city is a 1,000-year-old mosque built for Muslim traders and not far from it is the Taoist temple, Guandi.\nFilipinos will also do a double take when they visit Rizal Park in Zhangguo village also in Quanzhou for its similarities to the one in Manila. The Fujian monument commemorates the Philippine hero while acknowledging his Chinese connection. Rizal\u2019s great-grandfather was Domingo Lam-co (Chinese name: Ke Yinan) who adopted the surname Mercado.\nA case for Mandarin\nBack in Fuzhou, about 50 Filipino students and teachers are studying Mandarin at 116-year-old Fujian Normal University. Some have been living in China for a couple of years now and are supported by the FFCCCII.\nLindsey Reyes, who hails from Bataan, believes studying the language will be a big advantage when she graduates. \u201cKnowing a foreign language is an advantage, what more if it\u2019s Mandarin?\u201dReyes and her companions say the language will make Filipinos more competitive in an increasingly globalized world. Knowledge of the language also becomes an imperative with China\u2019s growing impact across economies.\nIn the Philippines, teachers who can teach Mandarin are few and far between. While a campaign for the inclusion of Mandarin in the curriculum has yet to take root, students like Reyes will have to content themselves with scholarships that will allow them to \u201cgive back\u201d to their mother country in the near future.\nAdjusting in a foreign country like China was not difficult for Christian Dayson of Pampanga. He was more surprised that all his perceptions of China were shattered when he started studying there.\n\u201cTheir personalities are not that different from Pinoys. Like us, they are very much willing when we need help,\u201d he says.\nAs run-ins on disputed waters continue, so too must trade and cultural exchanges, according to Cham. Fujian today also remains a commercial center of trade for Filipino products such as durian, banana chips and other agricultural products.\nBased on data from the Fujian government, exports to the Philippines grew 16 percent in 2021 to $10.43 billion, while imports increased almost 41 percent to $1.2 billion in the same year.\nTRAFFIC-FREE Xiamen\u2019s roads are free of heavy traffic even at peak hours due to pedestrian-friendly sidewalks and e-bikes scattered all over the city, ready for renting using e-wallets.\nFFCCCII president Cecilio Pedro says it\u2019s high time for a \u201creset\u201d in Philippine-China relations in the direction of \u201cmore cooperation and dialogues.\u201d\nIn a follow-up email correspondence with the Inquirer, the Fujian government says the dispute at sea is \u201crooted in the intersection of history, law and geopolitics, and there is currently no universally accepted solution.\u201d\nYour subscription could not be saved.

Exchanges between the two cultures can also promote cultural diversity and the protection of cultural heritage. Exchanges and cooperation between the two peoples can promote mutual understanding and friendship, help ease political tensions, and provide a solid social foundation for the stability and development of bilateral relations.\u201d\nINQ\nREAD NEXT\nHog raisers brace for slow recovery\nGov\u2019t spending slowdown shrank Nov budget gap\nEDITORS' PICK\n2 more hotel workers charged for the death of Liam Payne\nSteve Kerr rips officiating in Warriors NBA Cup loss to Rockets\nTrump is Time\u2019s Person of the Year, rings NYSE\u2019s opening bell\nSelena Gomez now engaged to Benny Blanco\nAlex Eala celebrates stellar year with high hopes for 2025\nFiesta Se\u00f1or 2025: Registration for Fluvial Procession begins\nMOST READ\nTeodoro says petitions to cancel candidacy \u2018political maneuvering\u2019\nSofronio Vasquez looks back on Rey Valera's advice after 'The Voice' US win\nPhilHealth\u2019s zero subsidy for 2025 an insult to members \u2013 group\nINQToday: Grijaldo skips House quad panel probe for the 4th time; held in contempt\nFollow\n@FMangosingINQ\non Twitter\n-->\nView comments",

(Photo from the Presidential Communications Office)\nMANILA \u2014 Shortly after winning the presidency of the Philippines in May of last year, Ferdinand \u201cBongbong\u201d Marcos Jr. took his first congratulatory call from a foreign head of state.\nUS President Joe Biden was on the line.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nBiden\u2019s speed in wishing the new president well delighted Marcos, according to brother-in-law Gregorio Maria Araneta III, who said the Philippine leader proudly told his family about that call a few days later over lunch. It \u201cput a smile on his face,\u201d Araneta, one of the country\u2019s most prominent tycoons, told Reuters in a rare interview, speaking from his wood-paneled office in Manila.\nFEATURED STORIES\nGLOBALNATION\nBamban under Alice Guo late in submitting cash advance vouchers \u2013 COA\nGLOBALNATION\n2 more PH nature reserves tagged of \u2018internationl importance\u2019\nGLOBALNATION\nJollibee Group\u2019s inclusive business practice boosts Filipino farmers\u2019 productivity, income\nThe US Embassy in Manila confirmed Biden was the first to call. What followed was two trips to the United States in less than a year for Marcos, and visits to the Philippines by high-ranking Biden administration officials. Among them: Vice President Kamala Harris, Secretary of State Antony Blinken, and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin III.\nManila-based political analyst Julio Amador III described the US outreach as \u201cunprecedented love-bombing\u201d aimed at resetting the US-Philippines relationship. Marcos\u2019 predecessor, the populist firebrand Rodrigo Duterte, was openly hostile to the United States and attempted to bring his country closer to communist China during his six-year term.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThere is urgency to the US charm offensive: America needs Manila squarely in its camp as tensions with China rise in the Asia-Pacific.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThe Philippines, Taiwan\u2019s neighbor to the south, would be an indispensable staging point for the US military to aid Taipei in the event of a Chinese attack, military analysts say. China\u2019s ruling Communist Party views democratically governed Taiwan as an inalienable part of China and refuses to rule out force to bring the island under its control.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nNavigational route\nUnder President Xi Jinping, Beijing has laid claim to an ever-widening swathe of the South China Sea and is bent on making his nation the unquestioned military power in East Asia. Such a shift would have far-reaching consequences for US influence, regional security, and global trade.\nMore than a fifth of the world\u2019s shipping passes through the South China Sea annually. The narrow straits around the Philippines and Taiwan bristle with undersea internet cables and are vital channels for US naval forces patrolling the region.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nReuters has been detailing the race between China and the United States to bulk up on advanced technologies that could determine who secures military and economic supremacy this century. Aerial and sea drones, AI-controlled weapons, and cutting-edge surveillance are fast reshaping warfare, with implications for the global balance of power.\nFor the United States, cementing alliances in the Asia-Pacific region is likewise crucial to keeping China in check. The US embrace of Marcos is key to that project.\nTo get inside the American effort at mending ties and Marcos\u2019 decisive pivot to Washington, Reuters spoke to more than two dozen current and former officials from both countries. Some spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media.\nThe reporting revealed a picture of a superpower anxious about China, knocked off stride by Duterte, and eager to partner with Marcos despite his family\u2019s history of brutality and corruption.\nMarcos\u2019 father, the late strongman Ferdinand Marcos Sr., was a steadfast US ally who was deposed in 1986 after Filipinos revolted against his regime. The elder Marcos was accused of orchestrating the detention and killing of thousands of political enemies and illegally siphoning billions of dollars from public coffers.\nHe died in exile in Hawaii in 1989 without facing trial. After his death, family members returned to the Philippines, where they have remained a force in politics.\nAction, not ancestors\nPresident Marcos did not respond to requests to be interviewed for this report. He has sought to recast his father\u2019s time in power as a golden era of development for the Philippines, while saying little about the allegations of wrongdoing. \u201cJudge me not by my ancestors, but by my actions,\u201d he said after his 2022 election win.\nThe US Department of State declined to comment on the Marcos family\u2019s past. In a statement to Reuters, it said US support for civilian security, democracy, and human rights was \u201cintegral to US foreign policy and national security interests\u201d in the Pacific.\n\u201cThe US-Philippines alliance is strategically irreplaceable, and a Philippine government that respects the rule of law, good governance, and human rights is essential to maintaining a strong alliance.\u201d\nReuters also learned of efforts by senior Filipino military and government officials that successfully stalled moves by Duterte to shred the US-Philippines security alliance. The reporting also sheds light on Marcos\u2019 calculus about the risks of aligning himself too closely with China.\nUnpopular\nDuterte\u2019s pro-Beijing stance was unpopular with the Filipino public, failed to produce as much Chinese investment as he had promised, and didn\u2019t stop territorial disputes between the two nations, which have intensified.\nIn October, the Philippines alleged that a Chinese coast guard vessel and a maritime militia boat \u201cintentionally\u201d collided with two Filipino boats on a journey to resupply Philippine personnel stationed at Ayungin (Second Thomas) Shoal, a contested outpost in the South China Sea. China claimed that the Filipino vessels were at fault.\nThe United States swiftly backed the Philippines, warning Beijing that it would defend its ally in the event of an armed attack under a 1951 mutual defense treaty.\nIt\u2019s a stance that pleased Manila, which has felt at times that Washington hasn\u2019t done enough to support the Philippines in such confrontations, two current and one former official told Reuters.\nDuterte declined to comment for this report.\nChina\u2019s Foreign Ministry, in a statement to Reuters, characterized China and the Philippines as \u201cclose neighbors across the sea\u201d with a common interest in friendship. It noted that China was the Philippines\u2019 largest trading partner and a major source of investment that \u201chad improved the living standard of the Filipino people.\u201d\nZero-sum mentality\nWithout naming the United States, the Foreign Ministry added that \u201csome countries, out of self-interest and with a zero-sum mentality, continue to strengthen their military deployment in the region, which is precisely aggravating tensions.\u201d\nRegarding Taiwan, the statement said China \u201cinsists on striving for the prospect of peaceful reunification with the utmost sincerity and effort, but will never commit itself to renouncing the use of force.\u201d\nThe Philippines is a former American colony that was granted independence in 1946, shortly after World War II. As part of the so-called first island chain\u2014a string of islands that encloses China\u2019s coastal waters\u2014it has long been a key node in U defense strategy in the Pacific.\nWorld\u2019s biggest navy\nIn addition to the Philippines, the United States for decades has partnered with other regional allies, including Japan, South Korea and Australia, to access military bases and conduct naval exercises. The enduring US presence has rankled an increasingly militarized and confident China.\nThe People\u2019s Liberation Army now has a sophisticated missile force designed to destroy the installations, aircraft carriers, and warships that are the backbone of American power in Asia. China boasts the world\u2019s biggest navy. It has stepped up \u201cgrayzone\u201d operations at sea\u2014aggressive military actions that fall short of acts of war\u2014especially around Taiwan and in contested waters of the South China Sea.\nWar games staged last year by think tanks, including the Center for a New American Security (CNAS), based in Washington, illustrated how indispensable the Philippines would be for a US defense of Taiwan.\nUS access to Philippine runways and aircraft fuel proved vital in scenarios showing a successful repulsion of Chinese forces in the early days of a conflict, said Becca Wasser, a defense analyst, and wargaming expert who ran the exercises for CNAS and has done the same for the US Department of Defense.\n\u201cI think that crystallized how important the Philippines could be and how, in some ways, relying on Japan and Australia, which are farther away, is just not enough,\u201d said Wasser, who leads The Gaming Lab at CNAS.\n\u2018The Punisher\u2019\nBut the US-Philippines relationship was strained with the 2016 election of Duterte, nicknamed \u201cThe Punisher\u201d in the media. He quickly launched an antinarcotics crackdown that resulted in extrajudicial killings of thousands of suspected criminals, a policy that raised alarms in the administration of President Barack Obama. Duterte also set about moving his country closer to economic powerhouse China, whose leader Xi shares his criticism of a US-led world order.\nIn October 2016, Duterte traveled to Beijing and proclaimed a new era of Sino-Filipino cooperation. \u201cAmerica has lost,\u201d he told an audience of Chinese business executives. \u201cI\u2019ve realigned myself in your ideological flow.\u201d Duterte returned to Manila with $24 billion in commitments under the Belt and Road Initiative, a global investment project that Beijing has used to wield soft power. Only a tiny fraction went ahead, according to the Philippines National Economic Development Authority.\nHostilities peaked in early 2020 after the United States canceled the visa of Sen. Ronald \u201cBato\u201d dela Rosa, who had spearheaded Duterte\u2019s drug war in his previous post as head of the Philippine National Police.\nOn Duterte\u2019s orders, the Philippines notified Washington of its intent to terminate the Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA) within 180 days. Ratified in 1999, the pact sets rules for rotating thousands of US troops into and out of the Philippines. The VFA is key to implementing the bedrock Mutual Defense Treaty of 1951 that requires the United States and the Philippines to support one another in the event either is attacked in the Pacific.\nDela Rosa did not respond to a request for comment. At the time, he said the cancellation of his visa was the latest in a list of \u201cgripes and disrespect\u201d by the United States.\nPushing back\nA retired senior Filipino military officer who served during that time recalled that US officials were \u201cvery worried, they thought everything will be like a house of cards falling.\u201d\nThe Americans \u201csaw the increasing influence of the Chinese\u201d over Duterte, the officer said.\nBut behind the scenes, the Philippine military establishment was pushing back against Duterte\u2019s efforts to chip away at the US alliance, the Filipino military official and six others told Reuters.\nUS-Philippines cultural ties are strong. More than 4 million Filipino-Americans live in the United States, and public opinion surveys have consistently shown that Filipinos have high levels of trust in America compared to China. Duterte at a 2017 press conference said \u201cour soldiers are pro-American, that I cannot deny.\u201d\nTwo of the military officials said the president early in his term had ordered the Philippine Navy to stop patrols in areas of dispute with China, instructions they said were ignored by senior commanders on the grounds of national defense. Philippine Navy chief Vice Adm. Toribio Adaci Jr. did not respond to a request for comment.\nIn late 2018, China and 10 Southeast Asian nations convened their first joint maritime drills. Some were held off the coast of China\u2019s southern Guangdong province. While other countries showed up with frigates and destroyers, the Philippine Navy sent a single logistics support vessel, according to a senior Filipino military officer with knowledge of the previously unreported events.\nNot a good message\nThe official explanation given to China was that the Philippine Navy couldn\u2019t free up larger vessels because it hadn\u2019t received enough advance notice of the exercises, the officer said. The real reason, the officer said, was to avoid looking like a military ally of China: \u201cIf we sent a warship, it would not send a good message to the international community.\u201d Two other Philippine officials with knowledge of the situation confirmed this account to Reuters.\nChina\u2019s Foreign Ministry did not respond to a request for comment on the incident.\nMeanwhile, the Philippine military continued joint exercises with the United States, despite a public pronouncement by Duterte in September 2016 that such drills would end because they were something \u201cChina does not want.\u201d\nA senior defense official, who asked not to be named, told Reuters that he pushed back on that edict and stressed to Duterte the benefits of the transfer of US technologies. The exercises continued.\nRepackaging\nStill, to avoid Duterte\u2019s ire, the two forces ceased mock combat drills, focusing instead on disaster response, according to Blake Herzinger, a former maritime security advisor to the US Pacific Fleet.\n\u201cWe had to rename all the exercises,\u201d said Herzinger, who was a US government contractor working on US-Philippines maritime security cooperation at that time.\nFor example, long-running regional warfare exercises known as Carat, or Exercise Cooperation Afloat Readiness and Training, were ended and reinstated with the Filipino name \u201cSama-Sama\u201d meaning \u201ctogether.\u201d\nThe navy also managed to scuttle plans by a Chinese-Philippine joint venture, Fong Zhi Enterprise Corp., to transform Fuga Island in the northern Philippines into a \u201csmart city\u201d with a high-tech industrial park.\nThe remote island is located less than 400 kilometers from Taiwan and close to subsea internet cables connecting the Philippines with the rest of Asia. Duterte agreed in principle to the $2-billion deal during a 2019 trip to Beijing. But he quickly backtracked after Philippine military officials went public with fears that China might use the development as cover for a spy post or to facilitate an invasion of Taiwan.\nFong Zhi Enterprise Corp. could not be reached for comment. A representative of the Chinese investor, Hongji Yongye, declined to comment.\nSenior government officials in 2019 killed efforts by Chinese companies to take over a shipyard in Subic Bay, a former US naval base in the Philippines that closed in 1992 after Manila terminated a bases agreement with Washington.\nTwo Chinese firms expressed interest, the government said at the time without naming the companies. Teodoro \u201cTeddy\u201d Locsin Jr, then-foreign minister of the Philippines, told Reuters he concluded the United States would consider such a sale to be \u201can act of hostility,\u201d given the strategic value of the site.\nThe deepwater port is in close proximity to both the Bashi Channel facing Taiwan and the South China Sea. Reuters was unable to determine the names of the Chinese companies.\nUpside\nJose Manuel \u201cBabe\u201d Romualdez, the Philippine ambassador to the United States, said he hustled to find an American buyer instead. In 2022, Cerberus Capital Management, a New York-based private equity firm that has invested in defense contractors and national security assets, paid $300 million for the shipyard.\nCerberus declined to comment on the deal.\nChina\u2019s Foreign Ministry, in its statement, said the Fuga Island and Subic Bay projects were \u201cpurely the actions of enterprises of the two sides and should not be subject to excessive political interpretation.\u201d\nWhile many Filipino officials were alarmed by Duterte\u2019s efforts to cozy up to China, two officials told Reuters there was an upside: They began to hear a more respectful tone from their US counterparts.\n\u201cThe US was, of course, nervous, and they showed this nervousness by actually reaching out to us and actually speaking in a language that\u2019s very uncharacteristic of the United States,\u201d one of the officials said.\nA change of US administrations with the election of US President Donald Trump led to more concrete shows of support for the Philippines.\nMany of the islands, shoals, and reefs in the South China Sea now claimed by the Philippines\u2014some of which are disputed by China and other nations\u2014were not formally annexed by Manila until 1978. That was well after the signing of the 1951 Mutual Defense Treaty between the United States and the Philippines, creating ambiguity as to whether Washington would assist its ally if an attack came in those places. The United States removed any doubt in 2019, when then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo traveled to Manila to assure officials that the United States would defend the Philippines in those areas too.\nClear commitment\nPompeo told Reuters he wanted to make it \u201cunambiguously clear\u201d that the United States was committed to providing the \u201cdeterrence support that was necessary to push back against an ever-increasing footprint of the Chinese Communist Party in the South China Sea and elsewhere.\u201d It was the \u201csingular purpose of the visit,\u201d Pompeo said.\nHe also gifted drones for use by the Philippines to fight Islamist militants operating in the south of the country. The Obama administration had halted some weapons sales to the Philippines over human rights concerns.\nWhen Trump came into office and stopped \u201ctalking about human rights, suddenly the major complicating factor in the relationship disappeared,\u201d said Gregory Winger, a political science professor at the University of Cincinnati specialized in US-Philippines relations.\nMutual admiration\nTwo Filipino officials agreed. Between Trump and Duterte there was \u201ca mutual admiration club,\u201d one said.\nDuterte kept extending the deadline to terminate the Visiting Forces Agreement or VFA. Advisors had warned him against the termination. Behind the scenes, military planning for its renewal continued.\nIn December 2020, shortly after Biden defeated Trump for the presidency, Duterte announced specific terms for keeping the VFA intact: 20 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine.\nThe Philippines, with a population of about 110 million people, had been hit hard by the pandemic and had few resources to fight it. Vaccine diplomacy would prove critical to keeping the VFA alive, according to a senior Filipino official with direct knowledge of the situation.\nAs part of the Biden administration\u2019s first trip to Southeast Asia in July 2021, Austin, the defense secretary, was to visit the Philippines to meet Duterte. The Filipino official told Reuters he advised a member of Austin\u2019s team ahead of time that the defense chief should bring a vaccine commitment with him in order to ensure the continuation of the VFA.\nThe Pentagon did not respond to a request for comment.\nMeanwhile, Romualdez, the Philippine ambassador to the United States, worked on the president. Romualdez told Reuters he urged Duterte to allow the military pact to continue because it would \u201cbe in our interest\u201d in tackling the pandemic.\n3 million doses\nOn July 30, 2021, a day after Austin and Duterte met in Manila, the White House announced it was giving three million doses of Moderna\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine to the Philippines, bringing the total from the United States to six million doses, the largest donation from a single country. That same day, Duterte said publicly he would fully restore the VFA.\nBiden had announced a month earlier that America would donate half a billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines to countries struggling with supplies \u201cwith no strings attached.\u201d Still, a US Embassy official told Reuters that \u201cdemonstrating our partnership with the Philippines in combating COVID\u201d helped sway Duterte\u2019s decision.\nIn some respects, the election of another Marcos in mid-2022 seemed to be no guarantee of better US-Philippines relations.\nBeijing ties\nMarcos has ties to Beijing dating to a childhood trip with his mother to meet top Chinese leaders, including Mao Zedong. As a young man he visited China frequently to \u201cdrum up business,\u201d according to a 2007 US diplomatic cable published by Wikileaks. During the presidential campaign, Marcos was asked by a journalist whether he would seek US help to address Chinese aggression in contested waters. His response: \u201cIf you let the US come in, you make China your enemy.\u201d\nAraneta, Marcos\u2019 brother-in-law, told Reuters that the president and his family had long felt \u201cbetrayed\u201d by Washington for the US role in supporting the change of government that pushed the elder Marcos from power. Still, Araneta said, Marcos Jr is a pragmatist who spent a lot of time thinking before his election about \u201chow to get the Americans back\u201d for the sake of the Philippines\u2019 economy and security.\nThe Biden administration lost no time in trying to reset relations. After Biden\u2019s congratulatory call, the US president sent Marcos an invitation to the White House. In September 2022, the two met on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York.\nBiden \u201cput him at ease, to assure and explain to him that he wanted to step up the relationship,\u201d a senior Biden administration official told Reuters.\nThe Philippine side expressed enthusiasm\u2014and surprise\u2014at what the official said was respect shown to them by the Biden team. An interlocutor said the Philippine \u201cexperience of great power diplomacy sometimes is lectures, and we do less of the talking,\u201d the official recalled.\nCivil lawsuit\nBrother-in-law Araneta said Marcos told the family that Biden had asked the new Philippine president during the UN meeting, \u201cWhat can I give you?\u201d and Marcos had replied light-heartedly that he would take \u201ceverything\u201d they could offer.\nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment.\nMarcos told Filipino journalist Anthony Taberna in August 2021 that he had not visited the United States in more than a decade due to the risk of arrest stemming from a 1995 judgment in a class-action civil lawsuit filed in US district court in Hawaii against him and his mother, Imelda, as executors of his father\u2019s estate. That lawsuit sought compensation for Filipino victims of martial law under Marcos Sr, when tens of thousands of people were imprisoned and thousands were killed, according to Amnesty International.\nThe court entered a judgment against the Marcos estate for nearly $2 billion to be paid to more than 9,500 victims, a decision the Marcoses appealed unsuccessfully. When the family refused to disclose the location of the estate\u2019s assets, a contempt judgment of $353 million was imposed in 2012 against Marcos Jr and Imelda. That penalty has not been paid. Plaintiffs have collected just a sliver\u2014$37 million\u2014of the $2 billion award, from sales of seized artwork and property owned by the family in the United States.\nMarcos\u2019 office had no comment on the case.\nIn Manila last year, Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman clarified that Marcos could now enter the United States because of diplomatic immunity conferred on him as president.\nBoats, aircraft\nRobert Swift, the Philadelphia-based lawyer who launched the civil lawsuit, told Reuters that Washington is placing primacy on its \u201cgeopolitical interests and ignoring the interests of \u2026 Filipino human rights victims.\u201d\nThe State Department declined to comment.\nSince Marcos took office on June 30, 2022, the Philippines has received patrol boats and surveillance aircraft from the US military. The United States has committed to deliveries of coastal and air defense systems, radars, military transport aircraft, and drones in the next five to 10 years.\nMarcos has reciprocated. The president has increased from five to nine the number of bases and strategic sites that the US military can access in the Philippines. The US Department of Defense in April said it planned to allocate more than $100 million by the end of the fiscal year for infrastructure investments for the nine locations.\nPublicly, Manila and Washington have portrayed the agreement as a way to provide disaster assistance in a country vulnerable to typhoons.\nStaging grounds\nPrivately, five current and former Filipino officials acknowledged the bases would likely become staging grounds for any conflict over Taiwan. Three officials said the sites would house prepositioned equipment and fuel. Three of the new sites are in the northern part of the Philippines\u2019 main island of Luzon, close to Taiwan. The US is also in talks to build a port on the strategic Batanes islands less than 200 km from Taiwan.\nBeijing has condemned the expanded US military access to sites in the Philippines as a threat to regional peace and stability.\nThe Department of State told Reuters the new sites would allow the two nations to \u201coperate together more frequently and with enhanced capabilities.\u201d It referred further questions to the Pentagon, which did not respond to requests for comment.\nLocsin, the former Philippine foreign minister, is now ambassador to the United Kingdom and the president\u2019s special envoy to Beijing. He credits Marcos for learning from the missteps of his predecessor.\nWhile Duterte\u2019s efforts to ally with China shocked the United States into paying more respect, they delivered neither the riches nor the security his government hoped for, he said.\nMarcos \u201cwasn\u2019t going to repeat that experience. So then, what\u2019s the only answer to that?\u201d Locsin said. \u201cTurn to the United States and tell them to produce.\u201d\n\u2014Poppy McPherson, Karen Lema and Devjyot Ghoshal\nYour subscription could not be saved.

        "content": "\u201cWe stand against unilateral sanctions, economic coercion, decoupling and supply chain disruption,\u201d Chinese paramount leader Xi Jinping declared during the summit marking the 10th anniversary of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).\nXi railed against American sanctions against China\u2019s tech titans and national champions, which have struggled to source high-end microchips and other critical inputs from traditional partners in the West in recent years. Instead, he presented his country as a champion of free trade and global connectivity.\nChina\u2019s paramount leader signed a total of $97.2 billion worth of cooperation projects and announced an additional $11 billion for the Silk Road Fund as well as another $100 billion to buttress financing by China\u2019s state-dominated financial institutions to further bankroll the BRI. Luckily for the Chinese leader, he didn\u2019t lack cheerleaders in the audience.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThe mega-event brought as many as 1,000 delegates to Beijing, including 23 national leaders, including controversial Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban and Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has been disinvited to other major events due to a pending International Criminal Court warrant of arrest over his catastrophic war against Ukraine.\nFEATURED STORIES\nOPINION\nRoque arrest serves ends of justice\nOPINION\nIs our ICC case dependent on insider witnesses?\nOPINION\nMAGA\nAhead of the summit, Beijing published a white paper that maintained that \u201cthe ultimate goal of the BRI is to help build a global community of shared future.\u201d In effect, the BRI, a $1-trillion initiative to remake global infrastructure with Chinese characteristics is a core element of China\u2019s global development initiative, which seeks to establish a Beijing-led international order.\nDespite all the tough talk and big announcements, however, it\u2019s clear that the BRI is losing steam \u2014 mirroring China\u2019s own economic slowdown. Over the past five years, China\u2019s BRI-related activities have been down by as much as 40 percent. Add to this, disruptions to global supply chains due to pandemic-related lockdowns and restrictions. China is facing domestic criticism from disgruntled citizens and is struggling due to its weakening economy.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nCrucially, China is also facing a plethora of obstacles in partner nations. An authoritative research report by scholars at Boston University showed that \u201cmany of the recipients of Chinese finance are subject to significant debt distress.\u201d In fact, Beijing has had to spare $240 billion to bail out BRI recipient nations across the developing world, most dramatically in the case of Sri Lanka and a whole host of African nations.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nIn the Philippines, however, what we have seen is less of a \u201cdebt trap,\u201d namely China ensnaring recipient nations with unsustainable lending, but instead a \u201cpledge trap,\u201d namely extraction of geopolitical concessions in exchange for illusory gains.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nPro-Beijing pundits and \u201cexperts\u201d love to emphasize the huge size of two-way trade between China and the Philippines. What they fail to mention, however, is how lopsided this trade is in favor of Beijing, whose heavily subsidized exports have driven many Filipino manufacturers (think of Marikina\u2019s once enviable shoe industry) out of business.\nCrucially, they also conveniently overlook how China has yet to honor any of its big-ticket infrastructure projects, which were promised to former president Rodrigo Duterte back in 2016! Sure, one can easily blame the Philippines\u2019 notorious bureaucracy and poor investment conditions. But one wonders if Beijing was ever sincere with all of those mega-pledges to begin with.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nReferring to $4.9 billion of Chinese-backed railway projects, Transportation Secretary Jaime Bautista recently lamented: \u201cWe have three projects that won\u2019t be funded by the Chinese government anymore. We can\u2019t wait forever and it seems like China isn\u2019t that interested anymore.\u201d\nSen. Sherwin Gatchalian, an especially wonky legislator closely following foreign investments, pointed out how many of China\u2019s projects have been \u201cdelayed due to the implementation of the right of way and bidding.\u201d But he also emphasized how China\u2019s projects tend to have more onerous terms of payment compared to Japan\u2019s and indirectly recognized potential national security concerns due to festering tensions in the West Philippine Sea.\nYour subscription could not be saved.

Critics may say \u201cgood riddance!\u201d Considering falling foreign direct investments over the past year, however, it\u2019s clear that our traditional Western partners will not fill in the vacuum unless we institute major reforms at home.\nrheydarian@inquirer.com.ph\nREAD NEXT\nA satisficing president\nSheer madness\nEDITORS' PICK\nSteve Kerr rips officiating in Warriors NBA Cup loss to Rockets\nSofronio Vasquez looks back on Rey Valera\u2019s advice after \u2018The Voice\u2019 US win\nEXPLAINER: Depleted uranium and why it\u2019s a national security threat?\nPriscilla Meirelles wins new beauty title, Teresa Loyzaga fulfills pageantry dreams\nFilipinos urged to go digital in giving Christmas cash gifts\nTolentino leads awarding of land titles to 4,029 Bukidnon farmers\nMOST READ\nTeodoro says petitions to cancel candidacy \u2018political maneuvering\u2019\nSofronio Vasquez looks back on Rey Valera's advice after 'The Voice' US win\nPhilHealth\u2019s zero subsidy for 2025 an insult to members \u2013 group\nINQToday: Grijaldo skips House quad panel probe for the 4th time; held in contempt\nFollow\n@FMangosingINQ\non Twitter\n-->\nView comments",

Many are based in places where China has financed big construction projects through leader Xi Jinping\u2019s signature Belt and Road Initiative.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nMyanmar\u2019s border regions long have been a magnet for criminals \u2014 historically including drug producers and traffickers \u2014 because of lax law enforcement. Such places are generally under the control of ethnic minority armed groups, either opposed to or allied with Myanmar\u2019s central government. Some also cooperate with organized crime gangs.\n\u201cFrom the vantage point of the Chinese government, it\u2019s a source of extreme embarrassment that you have so many of these Chinese criminals operating all across Southeast Asia,\u201d said Jason Tower, an expert on transnational crime with the United States Institute of Peace.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThe syndicates also are known for \u201cpig butchering\u201d cons, where scammers entice individuals, often halfway across the world, to invest their money in bogus schemes after duping them into digital romances.\nThe scammers divide their targets into two categories: Chinese and non-Chinese. They use scripts, images of models and influencers and translation software to trick the people they contact by phone or online into parting with their money. Victims can be anywhere in the world.\nThe criminals have \u201cridden on the shoulders of the Belt and Road Initiative,\u201d said Tower, who outlined links between the criminals and Chinese state enterprises, think tanks and government officials in a 2020 report written for the United States Institute of Peace.\nZhang was working in Thailand and on a visa run to Laos when he met the man who lured him to the scam compound in Myanmar. Giving what he said was his last name, Gao, he claimed to be a broker and travel agent for Chinese living in Thailand. Zhang and his wife wanted extra money to pay for in vitro fertilization to have another child. Gao suggested he go work in Myawaddy, in eastern Myanmar\u2019s Kayin state, teaching a local chef how to cook Chinese dishes in Gao\u2019s new restaurant. The pay would be double what Zhang made in China.\nZhang was wary. Since a 2021 coup, military-controlled Myanmar has been embroiled in civil conflict. But Gao reassured him that he wouldn\u2019t be doing anything illegal and said the restaurant would have plenty of customers since many cyber scam businesses were operating in the area.\nThat might have raised a red flag but it was only once he got to Myanmar that Zhang realized his predicament. He asked to go back home, saying there was a family emergency. His family helped him scrape together some 40,000 yuan ($5,472) to pay off the debt Gao claimed he owed him, and he slipped away one night, swimming across the Moei River into Thailand, where he turned himself in to Thai police, who contacted the Chinese Embassy.\nZhang showed the AP copies of his deportation notice from the Thai Immigration police and a temporary ID card. He returned to China in late June and was questioned by Chinese police but not detained. He has been sharing his story on Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok, to alert others to the risks and says people often contact him about relatives trapped in cyber scam compounds.\n\u201cWe all went out with this wonderful sense of hope, but then reality slammed us in the face,\u201d he said.\nIn total, China has detained some 4,000 suspects and returned them back to China.\nBreakthrough results\nThe Ministry of Public Security has claimed \u201cbreakthrough results\u201d through operations in coordination with Myanmar authorities. On Monday, they announced they had repatriated another 2,349 people. The ministry did not respond to a faxed request for comment.\nOne 31-year old former chef who was smuggled into Myanmar\u2019s Wa State earlier this year said he saw his company hand over four people to Chinese police with little fanfare in September. Other companies did the same, said the man, who was smuggled into Myanmar and later rescued by a non-profit organization. He declined to be named out of fear of government retribution, and The Associated Press could not independently verify his account.\nOverall, the enforcement actions don\u2019t seem very comprehensive, experts say. The groups now based in Myanmar originally were located in Cambodia. When Cambodia cracked down on online gambling rings and illegal casinos in 2019, many of the groups just moved to less well policed places in Myanmar. Some were taken over by rival gangs.\nChina\u2019s efforts to repair its image have so far not made much headway, said Thitinan Pongsudhirak, a professor of political science at Thailand\u2019s Chulalongkorn University.\nYour subscription could not be saved.

It is a major part of Chinese President Xi Jinping\u2019s push for China to play a larger role in global affairs.\nFEATURED STORIES\nNEWSINFO\nPhilHealth\u2019s zero subsidy for 2025 an insult to members \u2013 group\nNEWSINFO\nINQToday: Grijaldo skips House quad panel probe for the 4th time; held in contempt\nNEWSINFO\nContempt orders vs Alice Guo, Cassie Ong, Tony Yang lifted\nWHAT IS THE BRI?\nCalled \u201cOne Belt, One Road\u201d in Chinese, the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) started as a program for Chinese companies to build transportation, energy, and other infrastructure overseas funded by Chinese development bank loans.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThe stated goal was to grow trade and the economy by improving China\u2019s connections with the rest of the world in a 21st-century version of the Silk Road trading routes from China to the Middle East and onto Europe.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nREAD:\nChina\u2019s Belt and Road plans losing momentum as opposition, debt mount \u2013 study\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nXi unveiled the concept in broad terms on visits to Kazakhstan and Indonesia in 2013 and it took shape in the ensuing years, driving the construction of major projects from railroads in Kenya and Laos to power plants in Pakistan and Indonesia.\nHOW BIG IS IT?\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nA total of 152 countries have signed a BRI agreement with China, though Italy, the only western European country to do so, is expected to drop out when it comes time to renew in March of next year.\n\u201cItaly suffered a net loss,\u201d said Alessia Amighini, an analyst at the Italian think tank ISPI, as the trade deficit with China more than doubled since Italy joined in 2019.\nChina became a major financer of development projects under BRI, on par with the World Bank. The Chinese government says that more than 3,000 projects totaling nearly $1 trillion have been launched in BRI countries.\nREAD:\nGov\u2019t warned vs relying on Chinese ODA, urged to strengthen PPPs instead\nChina filled a gap left as other lenders shifted to areas such as health and education and away from infrastructure after coming under criticism for the impact major building projects can have on the environment and local communities, said Kevin Gallagher, the director of the Boston University Global Development Policy Center.\nChinese-financed projects have faced similar criticism, from displacing populations to adding tons of climate-changing greenhouse gases to the atmosphere.\nWHAT ABOUT THE DEBT TRAP?\nChinese development banks provided money for the BRI projects as loans, and some governments have been unable to pay them back.\nThat has led to allegations by the U.S. and others that China was engaging in \u201cdebt trap\u201d diplomacy: Making loans they knew governments would default on, allowing Chinese interests to take control of the assets. An oft-cited example is a Sri Lankan port that the government ended up leasing to a Chinese company for 99 years.\nREAD:\nChinese envoy assures PH: No China \u2018debt\ntrap\u2019\nMany economists say that China did not make the bad loans intentionally. Now, having learned the hard way through defaults, China development banks are pulling back. Chinese development loans have already plummeted in recent years as the banks have become more cautious about lending and many recipient countries are less able to borrow, given their already high levels of debt.\nChinese loans have been a major contributor to the huge debt burdens that are weighing on economies in countries such as Zambia and Pakistan. Sri Lanka said last week that it had reached an agreement with the Export-Import Bank of China on key terms and principles for restructuring its debt as it tries to emerge from an economic crisis that toppled the government last year.\nWHAT\u2019S NEXT FOR BRI?\nFuture BRI projects are likely not only to be smaller and greener but also rely more on investment by Chinese companies than on development loans to governments.\nChristoph Nedopil, director of the Asia Institute at Griffith University in Australia, believes that China will still undertake some large projects, including high-visibility ones such as railways and others including oil and gas pipelines that have a revenue stream to pay back the investment.\nREAD:\nChina\u2019s divide, rule tactic seeks gaps in PH unity to conquer WPS\nA recent example is the launching of a Chinese high-speed railway in Indonesia with much fanfare in both countries.\nYour subscription could not be saved.

That ranges from wind and solar farms to factories for electric vehicle batteries, such as a huge CATL plant that has stirred environmental concerns in BRI-partner Hungary.\nREAD NEXT\nBiden heads to Israel and Jordan as Israel-Hamas conflict fear...\nComelec allows transfer of \u2018incompetent\u2019 PhilHealt...\nEDITORS' PICK\nTransman Jesi Corcuera gives birth to baby girl\nSofronio Vasquez looks back on Rey Valera\u2019s advice after \u2018The Voice\u2019 US win\nSteve Kerr rips officiating in Warriors NBA Cup loss to Rockets\nFilipinos urged to go digital in giving Christmas cash gifts\nUAAP Finals: UP's Reyland Torres not suspended for Game 3\nPriscilla Meirelles wins new beauty title, Teresa Loyzaga fulfills pageantry dreams\nMOST READ\nTeodoro says petitions to cancel candidacy \u2018political maneuvering\u2019\nSofronio Vasquez looks back on Rey Valera's advice after 'The Voice' US win\nPhilHealth\u2019s zero subsidy for 2025 an insult to members \u2013 group\nINQToday: Grijaldo skips House quad panel probe for the 4th time; held in contempt\nFollow\n@FMangosingINQ\non Twitter\n-->\nView comments",

He cited that although the Kaliwa Dam project has a comparatively shorter repayment period, it has a hefty two percent interest rate which all Filipinos will bear repaying \u2013 whether they will benefit from the project or not.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nIn contrast, it was pointed out that tapping the private sector is a more strategic move.\nManhit said that while the government finances large-scale infrastructures, PPPs can already start developing ones that the country urgently needs.\n\u201cPublic-Private Partnerships hold the potential to accelerate infrastructure development and bring innovative solutions to the table. It is not just about building bridges. It is also about building trust between the public and private sectors, as well as the Filipino people,\u201d he stated.\nMeanwhile, the author of the said study pointed out that to improve transparency and accountability in infrastructure projects, the public has to be provided with more access to its details, including documents involved in the matter.\n\u201cNotably, transparency is central to empowering people: when citizens can easily obtain the public information that affects their well-being, especially the direct stakeholders, they are better equipped to hold their leaders accountable and to participate in the decisions that affect their lives. Lack of transparency and accountability leads not only to potential corruption but also to conflict of interest, and favoritism,\u201d Stratbase ADR Institute Non-Resident Fellow Dr. Rizal Buendia said.\nIn the same forum, Senator Grace Poe, in her keynote speech, also emphasized the need to focus more on PPPs as they can better help revitalize the country\u2019s infrastructure growth.\n\u201cThrough PPPs, this government can do more with less. PPPs offer stable funding for capital-intensive infrastructure projects with the promise of efficient and innovative services,\u201d she said.\n\u201cPPPs can provide parallel, if not better, advantages than official development assistance. By requiring value-for-money proposals, the better quality and longer life cycles of PPP projects make it more cost-effective than those solely financed by the national budget or ODA,\u201d she continued.\nShe further added that these PPPs offer smart solutions through innovative and technology-driven projects and that sustainable and climate-responsive design should be the norm in the country\u2019s infrastructures.\nRELATED STORIES\nYour subscription could not be saved.

Syria joined China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative in 2022 and was welcomed back into the Arab League in May.\nFaced with a crippled economy and little to show so far from his efforts to rebuild ties with Arab states, Assad is keen for financial support. But any Chinese or other investment in Syria risks entangling an investor in U.S. sanctions under the Caesar Act in 2020 that can freeze assets of anyone dealing with Syria.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\n\u201cIn his third term, Xi Jinping is seeking to openly challenge the United States, so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a surprise that he is willing to go against international norms and host a leader like Assad,\u201d said Alfred Wu, an associate professor at Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy in Singapore.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\n\u201cIt will further marginalise China in the world, but he doesn\u2019t care about this,\u201d he said.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nAssad\u2019s visit to China in 2004 was the first by a Syrian head of state since ties were established in 1956.

Security Council, where China and Russia both have a veto.\nChina has used its veto at least eight times on U.N. motions condemning Assad\u2019s government. However, China has not directly supported the regime\u2019s efforts to regain control of the country.\nSyria, a small oil producer, holds strategic significance for China. It lies between Iraq, a major oil supplier to China, and Turkey, the terminus of economic corridors stretching across Asia into Europe. Syria also borders Jordan and Lebanon.\nIn 2008 and 2009, Chinese state energy firms Sinopec Corp, Sinochem and CNPC invested a combined $3 billion in Syria, spurred by Beijing\u2019s call to acquire global oil and gas assets.\nInvestments included Sinochem\u2019s $900 million purchase of London-headquartered Emerald Energy, which had Syrian assets, although its operations in Syria halted in 2011, a partner firm said. CNPC, which was involved in producing oil at several small blocks, ceased production around 2014.\nAnalysts doubt Chinese firms are considering returning to Syria, given its poor security and dire financial situation.\n\u201cSyria has been trying to get investment from China for a long time \u2026 but the big question is whether any proposals discussed during this visit turn into actual projects,\u201d said Samuel Ramani, an analyst at London\u2019s RUSI think-tank.\nYour subscription could not be saved.

        "content": "As Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger puts it, microchips are the new oil\u2014and will be more important than oil and gas over the next five decades. Because of this, the core national interest of the United States is to maintain technological superiority by denying China the opportunity to catch up in microchip technology. Two columns ago, I looked into how this manifests in a growing US-led alliance. In my previous column, I then added a related topic: the ongoing competition between the US and China over submarine cables, with both nations fiercely competing to leverage their diplomatic and commercial power to make countries choose sides.\nToday, we look at data centers. In previous years, Singapore\u2019s reign had been challenged by Indonesia. The Philippines is now seeking to compete, with PLDT, SpaceDC, the Threadborne Group, YCO Cloud Centers, Beeinfotech, and Globe Telecom, Dito Telecommunity, and Converge ICT engaging with foreign partners. What has helped make data centers increasingly attractive domestically is increased cable capacity as funds originally earmarked for China are diverted to places like the Philippines, as well as a favorable policy environment, a growing domestic market and global-ready workforce, translating to a compound annual growth rate of 11.2 percent from 2022-2027.\nInvestments from the US and EU lack the wallop of full state support. The Digital Silk Road component of the Belt and Road Initiative envisions state \u201cinvestments in telecommunications-network infrastructure, including 5G, submarine and overland fiber-optic cables, satellite ground tracking stations, data centers, whole-of-system integrated solutions such as \u2018smart city\u2019 and security-sector information systems, and select \u2018over-the-top\u2019 applications such as financial services and processes (fintech) and e-commerce investments.\u201d Untroubled by elections or even, to a large extent, public opinion, China has been able to focus its energies on long-term planning and swift execution.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThe battle began over a decade ago. In 2014, Xi Jinping declared that \u201cThe flow of information guides the flow of technology, capital, and talent,\u201d and that the amount of information controlled has become an important indicator of a nation\u2019s soft power and competitiveness.\nFEATURED STORIES\nOPINION\nRoque arrest serves ends of justice\nOPINION\nIs our ICC case dependent on insider witnesses?\nOPINION\nMAGA\nBoth nations, China and the US, are using their laws to foster their national security. China\u2019s rests on twin planks: a personal information protection law modeled on the EU\u2019s regulations, and a data security law. According to a commentary by Reva Goujon: \u201cBeijing\u2019s philosophy on data sovereignty rests on several principles: data localization requirements, state oversight and restrictions on cross-border data flows, the right to force transfers of source code, the protection of personal data, and the state\u2019s right to sweeping surveillance powers.\u201d\nFor its part, as we\u2019ve seen, the US is enforcing an advanced microchip blockade on China, refusing to give landing rights to cables that directly connect to China, and maintains a Bureau of Industry and Security Unverified List which \u201csubjects foreign firms to strict licensing requirements\u201d as an antidote to China laws requiring companies to share data with the state.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThe flow of data itself also brings up national security. Last year, Aynne Kokas\u2019 \u201cTrafficking Data: How China Is Winning the Battle for Digital Sovereignty\u201d was published by Oxford, arguing that a failure of US political leadership, the mania for disruption of Silicon Valley, and Wall Street\u2019s seeking growth at all costs fueled China\u2019s remarkable accumulation of wealth through technology\u2014with Chinese firms quietly mining the US for data to send home. This year\u2019s latest buzzword\u2014artificial intelligence\u2014is leading governments to consider (and act) on its implications. The West is tackling concerns piecemeal; China is taking a much more integrated approach.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nA study by our own National Defense College also points out the fourth dimension of the China-US competition: actual military use of cyberspace. Here, China was advanced; for over two decades now, I have been referring to how, in 1996, Wei Jincheng published an article, \u201cInformation War: A New Form of People\u2019s War\u201d in the Liberation Army Daily of the People\u2019s Republic of China, and how this thinking has been implemented over the years from internet espionage, to online brigades to trolls, to the \u201cgreat firewall of China\u201d and now the Digital Silk Road. Theory has been accompanied by practice: China mobilized hackers as far back as 1999 in revenge for the accidental bombing by Nato of its embassy in Belgrade; in 2007, China demonstrated its capacity to destroy satellites in space and Russia did so in 2021 (China is also building the BeiDou Navigation Satellite System to rival GPS).\nEmail: mlquezon3@gmail.com; Twitter: @mlq3\nYour subscription could not be saved.

        "content": "Early in February, the island of Matsu\u2019s two cables linking it to Taiwan were cut: first by a fishing vessel, then by a cargo ship.\nThe island is the closest outpost of Taiwan to the Chinese mainland. Excused as \u201caccidents,\u201d the incidents coincided with increasing tensions as the rhetoric emanating from Beijing against Taipei and Washington escalated and underlined the vulnerability of global internet traffic to disruption.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThis has been an increasing source of concern since January 2022, when the Svalbard Undersea Cable System which links mainland Norway and the Svalbard archipelago in the Arctic Ocean was cut: Suspicions fell on Russia, which had been complaining that a Svalbard-based satellite facility was tracking its submarines. The incident reminded observers of a 2014 action by Russia preceding its annexation of Crimea when it damaged cables connecting the area to the rest of Ukraine.\nFEATURED STORIES\nOPINION\nRoque arrest serves ends of justice\nOPINION\nIs our ICC case dependent on insider witnesses?\nOPINION\nMAGA\nWe ourselves are no strangers to the disruption cut undersea cables can cause, in war and peace. We have been connected to the world by undersea cables since the first one connecting us to Hong Kong was laid in 1880. After Commodore George Dewey sank the Spanish fleet at Manila Bay, in 1898, the Spanish governor general refused to allow the Americans use of the cable to Hong Kong; so Dewey cut it, sending a revenue cutter to carry dispatches to and from Hong Kong; later on, he cut the cable to Capiz, isolating Manila from the rest of the archipelago.\nBack in 2006, the vulnerabilities of the undersea cable system were demonstrated when a massive earthquake off Taiwan affected over 120 call centers: They were totally cut off from their clients on the day of the earthquake, with capacity still down by 40 percent three days after the quake. Most recently in 2010, \u201cterrorists also cut cable lines near Cagayan de Oro,\u201d according to the Maritime Awareness Project.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nBack in 2006, all our internet systems connect to the outside world from a single point, somewhere in the vicinity of Batangas. Since then, the number of cables has increased, not least because, as relations between America and China soured, funds were diverted to beef up the networks with friendlier countries, including the Philippines. Submarine Networks says that \u201ctoday 11 in-service international submarine cable systems connecting the Philippines, and another six transpacific and intra-Asia subsea cables under construction,\u201d adding that, \u201cBy 2024, there will be seven trans-pacific subsea cables connecting the Philippines to the US.\u201d Last week, we looked at the rivalry between the United States and China\u2014involving the American-led effort to deny China advanced microchip technology and capacity\u2014is also manifesting itself in another rivalry forcing nations to take sides. Here is a revealing case. The Pacific Light Cable Network began as a Chinese majority-owned submarine cable system initially designed to connect Hong Kong, Taiwan, the Philippines, and the US. PLDC (Pacific Light Data Communication) also had two major American partners: Google and Meta (formerly Facebook). In 2020, Team Telecom of the US Department of Justice recommended disapproval of its undersea cable connection to the US. So Google and Facebook refiled their application to connect Taiwan and the Philippines to the US, abandoning the Hong Kong portion, and \u201cwithout ownership and control by a Chinese entity.\u201d By January 2022, this was approved and in February, the Dr. Peng Telecom Media Group, a Chinese stakeholder in PLDC, sold its stake at a loss, replaced by a Canadian investor.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThere were other repercussions to the Team Telecom announcement. Between September 2020 and March 2021, three trans-pacific cables projects to Hong Kong withdrew their US landing applications, while two new cable projects: Bifrost (with Facebook, Keppel, Telin as partners) connecting the US west coast, to Guam, Singapore, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Echo (Facebook, Google as partners) connecting the US west coast, Guam, Singapore, Indonesia, were announced.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nFor its part, China has been withholding cooperation on undersea cables. Last February, it left South East Asia-Middle East-Western Europe 6 (or Sea-Me-We 6) consortium; instead, China Telecommunications Corp. (China Telecom), China Mobile Limited, and China United Network Communications Group Co. Ltd. (China Unicom) announced a Europe-Middle East-Asia undersea cable project to link Hong Kong to Hainan, \u201cbefore snaking its way to Singapore, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and France,\u201d Reuters reported last month. HMN Technologies, (majority owned by Huawei Technologies) would make and lay down, the cable, with industry analysts saying this might prevent \u201csome parts of the world\u201d from purchasing capacity in the cable because of this. Reuters had already declared last March that the US and China were waging war beneath the waves.\nThe year before, China Telecom and China Mobile, which had a combined stake of 20 percent, withdrew from a project linking Asia with Europe when a US company was contracted to build it. The US for its part has rejected \u201cseveral\u201d cable projects that either involved Chinese companies or directly connected mainland China or Hong Kong to the US on national security grounds. (Chinese law requires their businesses and organizations to share data with the government when national security is invoked.)\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nChina includes undersea cables in the Digital Silk Road portion of its Road and Belt Initiative. This strategic vision is what makes otherwise odd schemes, such as Chinese interest in building a \u201csmart city\u201d (and other proposals like an industrial park and an airport expansion) on remote Fuga Island, which is administratively part of Aparri, make sense. A Guardian article recently reported that our military, alarmed, decided to establish a naval base there instead; now there is talk of its possible use as an Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement site. Fuga is in the Bashi Channel which separates us from Taiwan, and which, in fact, remains disputed between Taiwan and the Philippines since the 1930s, and where China has been sending its air force to do exercises over the channel.\nFive days ago, Biz Buzz pointed to Boracay where Dennis Uy had packaged a 2018 deal in which KT Corp. of Korea put up public Wi-Fi in parts of the island, throwing in 40 CCTV cameras for the use of the local government. The system was meant to use the (then nonexistent) infrastructure of Uy\u2019s Converge ICT, which is finally in place. I\u2019ve followed Uy\u2019s zigzagging efforts and China Telecom\u2019s frustrated efforts to come in as the third player in our telecoms, for years in this space, but note that Uy of Converge is different from Uy of Dito.\nConverge is a partner (with China Mobile International Limited, China Unicom Global, PPTEL SEA H2X Sdn. Bhd., HMN Technologies Co. Ltd.) in a submarine cable project to link the Philippines, Hong Kong, China, Thailand, East Malaysia, and Singapore by 2024 called South East Asia Hainan-Hong Kong Express Cable System (SEA-H2X). This contrasts with it merely buying access to Keppel Telecommunications and Transportation\u2019s Bifrost Cable System connecting Singapore, Indonesia, and the Philippines, to the US West Coast. Last February, construction of the landing station for this cable was begun in Davao City.\nThe same Biz Buzz article mentioned that Dennis Uy is getting into the data center game, with a \u201cbig\u201d one to rise in Para\u00f1aque with a \u201cmultinational player\u201d holding a 40 percent stake. But this is another fast-growing, strategic arena of competition between China and the US.\nYour subscription could not be saved.

(INQUIRER FILE PHOTO)\nMANILA, Philippines \u2014 The Chinese Embassy in Manila on Sunday warned the Philippines against opening up additional sites under its Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (Edca) with the US government, saying this will drag the country into \u201cthe Taiwan question\u201d and further undermine stability in the region.\nIn a statement, the embassy questioned Washington\u2019s continued interest and strengthening of its military alliance with Manila through their 2014 agreement, saying that \u201cto bundle the Philippines into the chariots of geopolitical strife will seriously harm Philippine national interests and endanger regional peace and stability.\u201d\nFEATURED STORIES\nGLOBALNATION\nBamban under Alice Guo late in submitting cash advance vouchers \u2013 COA\nGLOBALNATION\nJollibee Group\u2019s inclusive business practice boosts Filipino farmers\u2019 productivity, income\nGLOBALNATION\n2 more PH nature reserves tagged of \u2018internationl importance\u2019\nThe statement was issued in response to US Ambassador to the Philippines MaryKay Carlson\u2019s interview with GMA Network on Friday, in which she said that new Edca sites would enhance local authorities\u2019 ability to defend themselves and grow their economy.\nApart from maritime tensions over the South China Sea which Beijing claims as its exclusive waterway, the island of Taiwan, which has developed into a separate government over the decades, also faces the threat of being retaken by China after breaking away from the mainland in 1949 following its takeover by Mao Zedong\u2019s communist forces.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\n\u2018Encircle and contain China\u2019\nAccording to the embassy, the United States \u201ckeeps upgrading\u201d its military cooperation with the Philippines \u201cto secure its hegemony and selfish geopolitical interests and out of the [its] Cold War mentality.\u201d\nArticle continues after this advertisement\n\u201cWhereas the US claims that such cooperation is intended to help the disaster relief efforts of the Philippines and some Americans even tout the Edca sites as driver of local economy, it is plain and simple that those moves are part of the US efforts to encircle and contain China through its military alliance with this country,\u201d the embassy also said.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nIt also cited concerns raised by the governors of Cagayan and Isabela about having their provinces used as Edca sites, as well as by other groups about the proposed expansion of the defense agreement.\nGroundbreaking\n\u201cThose visionary people all asked the soul-searching questions: If the new sites are located in Cagayan and Isabela, which are close to Taiwan, does the US really intend to help the Philippines in disaster relief with these Edca sites? And is it really in the national interest of the Philippines to get dragged by the US to interfere in the Taiwan question?\u201d\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nCarlson, in the interview, disclosed a groundbreaking ceremony on March 20 for a $24-million airstrip extension and rehabilitation project at Basa Air Base in Pampanga province.\nShe said the US Secretary of the Air Force will attend the event, adding that the project is one of many in the pipeline worth a total $80 million.\nBasa Air Base is one of five previously identified sites where future facilities and structures would be built under Edca.\nThe four other \u201cagreed locations\u201d are the Fort Magsaysay Military Reservation in Nueva Ecija; Lumbia Airfield in Cagayan De Oro; Antonio Bautista Airbase in Puerto Princesa, Palawan, and Benito Ebuen Air Base in Cebu.\nShe said the five areas were part of an \u201cinterconnected sort of fabric\u201d of keeping people of both countries safe.\nCarlson also said she did not believe the Edca sites would become a \u201cmagnet\u201d for Chinese \u201caggressive behavior.\u201d\n\u2018Stirring up trouble\u2019\nOn the South China Sea issue, the Chinese Embassy maintained that \u201cthere is no problem of freedom of navigation\u201d there.\n\u201cWhen talking about free and open waterways, what the US has in its mind is actually the freedom of rampage of its warships in the South China Sea,\u201d the statement read, adding that the US military had been \u201cstirring up trouble\u201d in the region.\nIt added that Washington has been \u201cganging up with its allies from other parts of the world to flex muscle in the South China Sea.\u201d\n\u201cBy doing these, the US has not only heightened tension, driven a wedge between China and the Philippines, but also has disturbed and upset the\u2002joint effort of countries in this region to safeguard peace and stability in the South China Sea,\u201d the embassy said.\nIt stressed that China and the Philippines, among other countries in the region, \u201cshould keep to the right track of maintaining good-neighborliness and attaining mutual benefit rather than getting distracted by forces who are fanning the flame and driving a wedge between us, even less inviting a bully into our community.\u201d\n\u201cWe need to focus on cooperation and development, and truly safeguard, promote and build peace, stability, prosperity of our region and bring more tangible benefits to people of our two countries,\u201d it added.\n\u2018Natural partners\u2019\nIn an earlier statement, the Chinese Embassy called out Washington for \u201cdiscrediting\u201d Beijing\u2019s economic relations with Manila.\nThe embassy was responding to an Inquirer story citing State Undersecretary Victoria Nuland as questioning whether Beijing\u2019s \u201cpromises\u201d had actually generated jobs for Filipinos.\n\u201c[S]uch remarks are in total ignorance of the Philippine people\u2019s pursuit of peace, cooperation and development as well as China-Philippines helping each other in developing the economy, improving people\u2019s livelihood, and increasing employment,\u201d the embassy said.\nIt added: \u201cCreating economic opportunities and jobs through military cooperation is tantamount to quenching thirst with poison and gouging flesh to heal wounds.\u201d\nThe embassy stressed that China and the Philippines are \u201cnatural partners for their geographical proximity, close kinship, and complementary advantages.\u201d\n\u201cIn recent years, under the strategic guidance of the two heads of state, China and the Philippines have deepened the synergy between the Belt and Road Initiative and the \u2018Build, Build, Build\u2019 and \u2018Build Better More\u2019 programs of the Philippines,\u201d it said.\nYour subscription could not be saved.

During our almost two-hour podcast with him, we truly felt Sofronio\u2019s sincerity and kindness. God indeed works in mysterious ways. The rejections he faced in the Philippines weren\u2019t setbacks; they were part of a greater plan. God prepared him for this moment, shaping him to step into the bigger version of the dream he\u2019s been praying for\u2014winning The Voice Season 26 in the US.\n\u201cWe\u2019re so proud of Sofronio! He made every Filipino around the world shine with pride. His life story is a powerful testament that dreams do come true.\u201d\nWant stories like this delivered straight to your inbox?\nStay informed.

        "content": "LIVELIHOOD UNDERMINED Almost a third of the Pag-asa Island population are fishermen and they are organized in an association headed by Larry Hugo (right), whose daily catch has dwindled due to the intimidating presence of the China Coast Guard in his usual fishing grounds. Hugo hopes that the foreign vessels will eventually \u201cmeet their match.\u201d \u2014Photos by Nestor Corraje\nPAG-ASA ISLAND, PALAWAN, Philippines \u2014 On this tiny piece of land, 389 Filipinos have settled down and made a home, making them a remote yet closely monitored community with a direct stake in the future of the disputed South China Sea.\nAmong them is Marilou Vales, 54, who first visited this 37-hectare island in 2004.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nPag-asa back then had no pier, so they had to disembark from their ship while still quite far from the coast, using a rope ladder to transfer to a rubber boat for the final stretch to the shore. Vales arrived as part of a summer tour organized by the municipality of Kalayaan, Palawan province, where she worked as a local government employee.\nFEATURED STORIES\nNEWSINFO\nVP Duterte now mulls hiring \u2018private security\u2019\nNEWSINFO\nSuspected China Coast Guard ship leaves Zambales uninspected\nNEWSINFO\nFilipiniana, Asean-inspired attire for gov\u2019t workers on Mondays\nAfter that, she frequently visited the island until she agreed to stay permanently in 2021.\nHer official designation today is \u201cisland coordinator,\u201d one tasked with overseeing the needs of the residents and reporting regularly to the town mayor, whose office is in Puerto Princesa City, the provincial capital.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nInternationally known as Thitu, Pag-asa is part of the cluster of islands known as the Spratlys and one of the seven that make up Kalayaan. In more geopolitical terms, it is the only Philippine-controlled outpost in the Spratlys with civilian occupants\u2014an assertion of the country\u2019s sovereignty in the face of China\u2019s expansionist claims in the South China Sea.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nEasier travel\nBut far from what Vales saw when she first laid eyes on Pag-asa, the island now does not only have a pier but also a sheltered port and beaching ramp, developments that have significantly eased travel.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThe old 1.3-kilometer runway, which used to be grassy and easily got muddy whenever it rained, will soon get an upgrade as part of a P3.2-billion plan under the proposed 2025 national budget to improve state facilities in the West Philippine Sea (WPS), the area within the South China Sea that marks the country\u2019s exclusive economic zone. The designation of this area as WPS, covering the waters off Batanes to Palawan, started in 2011 during the Benigno Aquino III administration.\nConstruction of a new hangar started in 2022 and is expected to be finished before the end of this year, said Vice Adm. Alfonso Torres Jr., commander of the Western Command of the Armed Forces of the Philippines, which has jurisdiction over the WPS.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThe state weather bureau is also setting up a synoptic station on the island for more accurate forecasting for the benefit of the civilian residents and military contingents stationed here.\nThese upgrades, according to Col. Francel Margareth Padilla, the AFP spokesperson, are \u201ca strategic investment in strengthening our external defense posture. These infrastructure improvements would enhance logistical support and operational readiness for our personnel, ensuring that we remain prepared to safeguard our national interests.\u201d\nLike any regular barangay (village) in the Philippines, Pag-asa now has a school, a health center, a police station, water and power supplies and a relatively reliable mobile phone service. There\u2019s at least one nurse and a midwife on call, while a doctor occasionally comes to visit from mainland Palawan.\nElectricity became 24/7 starting in 2018, while access to potable water is maintained through a filtration system.\nA handful of \u201csari-sari\u201d stores operate, though the goods shipped from Palawan once or twice a month tend to be pricier due to the transport costs entailed by the 480-km trip from the mainland.\n\u201cA lot has changed in the island. We are happy because we never expected this. I think more developments are coming because many are extending help,\u201d Vales told this reporter in a recent interview.\nThe Inquirer was part of the media delegation that covered a 10-day maritime patrol conducted in August by the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources in the WPS, which included a stop on Pag-asa.\nOUTDOOR OPTION Because of poor ventilation in their assigned room, some students at Pag-asa Integrated School hold their class under a tree on a particularly hot day in August.\nTo further demonstrate Philippine control, Vales said more infrastructure projects should be built here \u201cto show that we are really interested and that this is really ours.\u201d\nLike the municipal employee, fisherman Larry Hugo, 45, has called this island his second home over the last 15 years. He first arrived in 2009 from Palawan after being told by friends about the construction jobs available.\nThe island had less than a hundred residents at the time, Hugo recalled.\n\u201cI was curious and I wanted to know what was in Pag-asa,\u201d he said when the Inquirer met him inside his small house, busy fixing a fishing net.\n\u201cWe were the ones who built the first school here,\u201d he said, referring to Pag-asa Integrated School, which currently has 14 teachers handling elementary to senior high classes.\nFree schooling\nAmong the teachers is Realyn Limbo, who arrived here in 2015 when there were only 23 students from Grades 1 to 6.\nMost of the students, Limbo said, were from mainland Palawan, where the overall cost of sending children even to public schools could still prove too steep for the poorest families.\n\u201cThe kids want to study, but life in mainland Palawan is expensive. So the local government gave their parents work here so their children could also study here,\u201d she said.\n\u201cHere everything is provided by the local government (including a rice subsidy) and the Department of Education (DepEd). The kids do not have to worry about anything. They just go to school and study,\u201d she added.\nHowever, some grades still needed to share classrooms due to the lack of facilities. When the Inquirer saw the school in August, one class was taking lessons under a tree because their room had poor ventilation on that particularly hot day.\nBut despite these inadequacies (which are actually still true in many other DepEd campuses nationwide), Limbo said, \u201cI am happy that the school population is growing.\u201d\nShe would always encourage her students to \u201cstay strong and study well,\u201d the teacher said, \u201cbecause I want them to have a bright future.\u201d\nThose words were addressed to the likes of Chinalyn Belidan, 13, a Grade 8 student who was born and raised in Pag-asa. Her mother currently works here as a housekeeper of the town\u2019s vice mayor.\n\u201cLife here is okay, although we lack equipment and school supplies like books, chairs, tables, electric fans,\u201d Belidan told the Inquirer. \u201cWe usually have classes outdoors because it\u2019s too hot inside.\u201d\nThe Pag-asa teenager shared her wish list: more classrooms, more chairs, and enough books\u2014so that she and her schoolmates would no longer need to share these basics.\nThe girl who grew up in the tiny island harbors big dreams. She said she would like to become a star athlete and make it to the Olympics, having been inspired by the gold-winning gymnast Carlos Yulo.\nShe has developed a love for swimming\u2014in the waters of the WPS where, going for a dip, she would always see Chinese ships on the horizon, spotting them even in the blackness of night thanks to their lights.\nThere were at least 18 Chinese maritime militia ships and a China Coast Guard vessel within sight from the island when the Inquirer was there.\n\u201cI am afraid because they might invade us,\u201d Belidan said, recalling how the sightings used to make her \u201ctremble in fear.\u201d Those moments ceased only when her parents told her to just pray.\nOn top of her ambitions in sports, Belidan said she would also like to join the Philippine Army because \u201cI want to defend the island.\u201d\nAside from the soldiers, three policemen\u2014Capt. Felerico Namuco Calingao, Cpl. Renante Dubria, and Master Sgt. Romulo Rivero\u2014help keep the local peace. The island has maintained a zero crime rate, at least since record-keeping began.\nNo cemetery yet\nLike Belidan, Hugo, the fisherman, expressed readiness to defend his part of the archipelago. He\u2019s ready to die in Pag-asa, he said, albeit pointing out that the island, after all the recent developments, has yet to have a cemetery.\n\u201cSo I think that once I get old and weak, I may have to leave this place because there is no cemetery here,\u201d he said with a chuckle. \u201cI might die here without seeing a local cemetery being built.\u201d\nHugo, president of the Pag-asa Island Fisherfolk Association with 114 members, recalled that in 2021, a China Coast Guard ship blocked his fishing vessel and blasted its horn as he was approaching one of the sandbars off Pag-asa.\nINFRA UPGRADE The new hangar under construction, one of the major upgrades of Pagasa Island\u2019s infrastructure. The work complements the earlier improvements on the island\u2019s 1.3-kilometer runway (above). Photos taken in August.\nHe lamented that their catch has dwindled from 50 kilos a day to just 20 kilos, because Chinese vessels have been driving away Filipino fishermen for years.\n\u201cWe are like thieves in our own territory,\u201d Hugo told the Inquirer inside his small home.\nHe also fears Beijing\u2019s new policy that authorizes its coast guard to arrest trespassers who cross what it claims to be its borders in the South China Sea.\n\u201cAt first, we were terrified about the new law, but what can we do, our livelihood is at stake here. Our families depend on us,\u201d he said.\nWhile this policy did not deter them from fishing in their traditional fishing grounds, we are more \u201ccautious now,\u201d said Hugo, noting that Chinese ships are always ready to ram their much smaller fishing boat.\n\u201cThey bully and harass us. But someday they will find their match,\u201d he added.\nEven for a part-time fisherman like Ador Sacamay, 28, an employee of the National Power Corp. assigned to Pag-asa, the difference has been palpable.\nHis catch has gone down to just five kilos a day, Sacamay said, as they have been displaced by foreign vessels, which they also suspect of engaging in cyanide fishing.\nNew source of income\nHowever, at least one unexpected source of income has emerged in Pag-asa: tourism. Vales said the island has been open to leisure travelers since 2023, with at least 10 homeowners offering lodgings. Three more homestay facilities are being built.\nAnd why not? Pag-asa, after all, can proudly grace any tourism brochure with its white sand beaches and crystal clear waters.\nAll that, plus a Philippine Navy or a Philippine Coast Guard ship now permanently stationed there as a deterrent to any Chinese act of aggression.\nYour subscription could not be saved.

I don\u2019t exactly remember when, but I am glad I did. It brought home two thoughts: First, a reminder of the enormous responsibility of being a physician and second, what I may have forgotten lately, my accountability as a citizen of this country beyond my profession.\nIn the past months, you must have probably seen familiar faces emblazoned on billboards contributing to the air, light, and noise pollution along Edsa. May I ask you if am I alone in wondering what our future holds? Walking through the hospital corridors about to call it a day, I decided to chat with the guards to get their take on the issue. One gave me a shy smile, shook his head sadly and said that he had lost the energy and the appetite to vote. \u201cDoctor, pare-pareho lang po at walang mapagpilian. Mahirap pa rin ang buhay.\u201d The other one shared that he hasn\u2019t voted in years and most probably won\u2019t be able to because he was registered in his home province. Digesting what they said, I urged them to still exercise their right for the upcoming elections, and promised to sit with them so we can come up with a list.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nDriving home that night, sitting in traffic, and looking at the long queue of people patiently waiting for a ride, recent random conversations with two strangers flashed through my mind. One was with a businesswoman who was waiting in line with me at a drugstore, and a cashier from a bakeshop where I bought a birthday cake. They echoed the same sentiments as the guards, and these had flowed from initial jump-off points such as the high cost of medicine, health care, and essential goods. While the sample size is too small to make a generalization, these verbalized comments allude to what has remained elusive, good governance.\nFEATURED STORIES\nOPINION\nRoque arrest serves ends of justice\nOPINION\nIs our ICC case dependent on insider witnesses?\nOPINION\nMAGA\nSo how can we empower people to choose correctly? Thinking about strategies made me review the applicability of the elements employed in motivational interviewing, a technique that was introduced to me and my colleagues as a way to address vaccine hesitancy. Its ultimate goal is to improve conversations around concerns and encourage informed decision-making while recognizing and respecting an individual\u2019s autonomy.\nFirst, difficult as it may be, set the stage for a nonjudgmental conversation. Rather than challenge their points of view or their choices, let us learn to listen to what they have to say. We should attempt to try to understand where people might be coming from. Encourage open-ended rather than leading questions. It may come as a surprise that what we thought was common knowledge isn\u2019t, especially for people who have taken shortcuts to get know the true complexion of a candidate simply because they neglected to do their research or read on history. Focus on how you can correct misinformation and disinformation by providing factual evidence.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nHandhold if at all possible by being the access to needed data beyond the bare minimum requirements of being a natural-born citizen of the Philippines, a registered voter, and with the ability to read and write. Begin with an aspirant\u2019s family background, include competencies together with the necessary ingredient of experience needed to efficiently carry out the duties required of an elected official, consider their track record even before running for office and while in their elected position. Have they managed to achieve their promised short- and long-term goals beginning with their own community or even started working toward these? Have they safeguarded your interests or been accused or convicted for going against the law? Avoid injecting your own views and opinions and resorting to character assassination. Time and circumstances have a way of revealing a person\u2019s true nature. Leave the mudslinging to them.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nSecond, foster an engaging group reflection on your discussions and invite them to share their thoughts. Do the candidates being considered for office represent and reflect the same beliefs and values that they hold dear? Is their behavior worthy of being emulated by the more impressionable, such as their own children?\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nIn closing the conversation, do not expect a recipient to come to a final decision but hope that he or she takes the time to study and scrutinize the candidates they are considering before casting their vote.\nThere are many things that we can do to show our love for country.

From the disparity in healthcare resources to the shared hope for something better, the 2024 Blood Cancer Patient Forum sheds light to key issues to rally key private and public stakeholders to take action.&nbsp;&nbsp;\nThe\n2024 Blood Cancer Patient Forum\n, themed\nKanser sa Dugo, Laban ng Bawat Pilipino\n, is the first-ever patient forum focused on blood cancers. It aims to bring together advocates and key stakeholders to raise awareness, and push the agenda for better access to healthcare for Filipino blood cancer patients.&nbsp;\nBlood cancer is caused by mutations in the DNA within blood cells, with Lymphoma, Leukemia, and Myeloma being the most common types of blood cancers. According to the Global Cancer Observatory of the World Health Organization, in the Philippines, an estimated 12,000 Filipinos a year are being diagnosed with blood cancer. That\u2019s 33 Filipinos a day\u2013 33 impacted lives forced to face an uncertain future due to blood cancer.&nbsp;\nHaving lived through the battle, Jheric Delos Angeles, Stage 4 Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma survivor, and his wife Anna Tapel-Delos Angeles, saw the need to create a community of Filipino blood cancer patients and their family members in order to educate more people and provide much needed support to those in need, including fighting for better healthcare. The couple founded\nLymphoma Philippines\nand the\nBlood Cancer Alliance of the Philippines\n.&nbsp;\nLymphoma Philippines\nis a non-profit organization for Lymphoma patients, survivors, and caregivers aiming to spread awareness and education on Lymphoma, and connect the community through medically-approved Lymphoma-related campaigns in the country. The couple also formed the\nBlood Cancer Alliance of the Philippines (BCAP)\nto help bridge resources to more blood cancer patients in partnership with Lymphoma Philippines, Kanser sa Adolescents &amp; Young Adults (KAYA) Community, EPCALM Adult Leukemia Foundation, MyeSpeak Foundation, Myelofibrosis Philippines, Touched by Max, Philippine College of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine, Healthway Cancer Care Hospital, and Enna Health.&nbsp;\n\u201cA lot has yet to be done in increasing awareness for blood cancers in the Philippines. We at the Philippine College of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine are committed to improving the blood cancer situation in the Philippines. A lot has been done, but there\u2019s still a lot to be worked on,\u201d shares Dra Clariza Santos, Department Head, Hematology Oncology, Healthway Cancer Care Hospital.\nThe event also saw the official introduction of\nBLOOM Philippines\n. The Blood Cancer Alliance of the Philippines, in partnership with the Philippine College of Hematology and Transfusion medicine, collaborates on a study that aims to gather baseline epidemiologic data on the diagnosis and treatment of blood malignancies in the Philippines (BLOOM Philippines). The goal of BLOOM PH is to create a registry containing demographic and clinical data of blood cancer patients, which will then be integrated in a hospital-based cancer registry system.\nThis new initiative joins\nThe LymphomaQR Project\n, an initiative launched by Lymphoma Philippines in 2024 that aims to make information accessible to the general public through an easy-to-use and familiar tool. With the goal of helping Filipinos have access to relevant information all throughout their Lymphoma journey, the LymphomaQR chatbot hopes to lessen the burden that they face. With LymphomaQR, anyone can:\nKnow more about Lymphoma, its symptoms\nPossible treatment options&nbsp;\nAvailable financial assistance programs&nbsp;\n\u201cWe consider it a great privilege to be able to do this for our community of warriors and survivors. It is a difficult battle, and we want to lessen the hurdles in whatever way we can at the moment, all while we continue to push for reform on a larger scale, says BCAP convenor Jheric Delos Angeles.\nADVT.\nThis article is brought to you by Blood Cancer Alliance of the Philippines.\nREAD MORE\nREAD NEXT\n16 die in clashes between Mexico security forces, alleged crim...\nUN chief tells Putin invasion of Ukraine violates internationa...\nEDITORS' PICK\n2 more hotel workers charged for the death of Liam Payne\nSelena Gomez now engaged to Benny Blanco\nSenate bill seeks to crack down on ticket scalpers\nEXPLAINER: Depleted uranium and why it\u2019s a national security threat?\nTransman Jesi Corcuera gives birth to baby girl\nPriscilla Meirelles wins new beauty title, Teresa Loyzaga fulfills pageantry dreams\nMOST READ\nTeodoro says petitions to cancel candidacy \u2018political maneuvering\u2019\nSofronio Vasquez looks back on Rey Valera's advice after 'The Voice' US win\nPhilHealth\u2019s zero subsidy for 2025 an insult to members \u2013 group\nINQToday: Grijaldo skips House quad panel probe for the 4th time; held in contempt\nFollow\n@FMangosingINQ\non Twitter\n-->\nView comments",

        "content": "A pastor for the peripheries\u2014a shepherd for the lost, the least, the vulnerable, and the oppressed. That\u2019s how I believe my brother, Bishop Pablo Virgilio David, or \u201cAmbo,\u201d has always understood his vocation. Although he hasn\u2019t always used the term \u201cperipheries,\u201d this concept has been a consistent thread running through his projects, no matter where he\u2019s assigned.\n(If I may, I hope readers of this column won\u2019t mind me deviating from my usual focus on national and global issues to reflect on last week\u2019s papal announcement. Bishop Ambo, along with 20 others, many from the global periphery, will be made a cardinal in a consistory in Rome this December. This extraordinary news has brought great joy to our family and friends, and\u2014judging from the past week\u2014also to the larger Filipino community. We are deeply grateful for the prayers, good wishes, and affection with which this joyful news has been received.)\nThe term \u201cperiphery\u201d has its roots in Latin American discourse, specifically in the context of \u201cdependencia\u201d theory. This political-economic framework describes the unequal relations between the center and the periphery, where the center subjugates and underdevelops the periphery. Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio, then Archbishop of Buenos Aires, introduced this terminology to the Vatican, articulating a vision of the Church as one that \u201cmust come out of itself and go to the peripheries\u2014both geographical and existential.\u201d He shared this vision with his fellow cardinals just before they gathered for the conclave to elect Pope Benedict XVI\u2019s successor.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nIn a fascinating extension of this theory, the future Pope Francis observed that the Church itself becomes \u201csick\u201d when it becomes overly self-referential. \u201cThe evils that afflict ecclesiastical institutions over time are rooted in self-referentiality, in a sort of theological narcissism,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Church, when it becomes self-referential, unknowingly begins to think it has its own light; it stops being the \u2018mysterium lunae\u2019 and falls into the gravest of sins\u2014spiritual worldliness. This, according to theologian Henri de Lubac, is the worst evil the Church can face: living for the glory of one another.\u201d\nFEATURED STORIES\nOPINION\nRoque arrest serves ends of justice\nOPINION\nIs our ICC case dependent on insider witnesses?\nOPINION\nMAGA\nWhen Ambo entered the Mother of Good Counsel Minor Seminary in San Fernando, Pampanga, in 1970, my father told him, \u201cSomeday you will become a bishop, and then you will have the chance to go to Rome to see the Pope.\u201d To an 11-year-old boy, the idea of becoming a bishop probably didn\u2019t mean much, but it meant the world to our parents. Sadly, my father passed away before seeing Ambo ordained as a priest, but my mother witnessed his ordination in 1983. It was the proudest moment of her life. How I wish she had lived to see him become a bishop in 2006, and now a cardinal.\nDuring his years at the Jesuit-run San Jose Major Seminary and Loyola School of Theology, seeing the Pope in Rome was likely the farthest thing from Ambo\u2019s mind. Those were the years of martial law\u2014a period of intense social and political turmoil. Community organizing and outreach to the peripheries became integral to the religious formation of priests and nuns, who felt called to respond to the country\u2019s crisis.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nIn 1980, after completing his theological studies but before his ordination, Ambo spent time in Pampanga\u2019s remotest villages, interpreting the Gospel in a way that resonated with the issues of the day. This experience sparked his scholarly interest in hermeneutics and biblical exegesis. He eventually earned a doctorate in biblical studies, graduating summa cum laude from Leuven University in Belgium.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThough grateful for the opportunity to deepen his understanding of God\u2019s Word, he was eager to return home after six years abroad, having missed the historic 1986 Edsa People Power Revolution. Upon his return, he resumed teaching at his old seminary in Pampanga, but the call to serve the peripheries never left him.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nHe launched a weekly television program called \u201cMen of Light\u201d with the help of the late film director Marilou Diaz-Abaya. Along with fellow priests\u2014many of them his former students\u2014he led discussions on the Gospel in Filipino and Kapampangan, with episodes uploaded to YouTube to reach overseas Filipino workers.\nPerhaps the project that most embodies his commitment to the peripheries is the creation of \u201cmission stations\u201d in his diocese of Kalookan during Rodrigo Duterte\u2019s infamous drug war. Alarmed that his diocese was turning into a \u201ckilling field\u201d in this brutal campaign, he organized priests, nuns, and laypeople to establish spiritual sanctuaries in the slums where the killings were taking place. Today, there are 21 of these faith communities, each with a makeshift chapel at its heart, located in the poorest neighborhoods. Every mission station is staffed by religious and lay volunteers who tirelessly minister to the spiritual and existential needs of the excluded.

A series of events were to take place in Hyderabad and Delhi\u2014business matching, plant visits, a visit to the historic FICCI HQ and the opening of Anshukam, \u201ca national initiative for textiles and handlooms.\u201d My interest was immediately piqued. Being a part of a delegation such as this would give me the opportunity to see and experience India and have a glimpse of its business and entrepreneurship landscape through the lens of the women of FICCI-FLO. \u201cFLO was established in 1983, as a division of [FICCI] which is the apex body of industry and commerce in India.\u201d It has 20 chapters representing 20,000 women\u2014entrepreneurs, professionals, executives.\nWhat followed were five days packed with opportunities to learn and engage with FLO. Each day was curated to give us a taste of Indian food, culture, and an appreciation of the Indian business landscape. We witnessed FLO\u2019s main objective, \u201cto encourage and facilitate women to showcase their talents, skills, experiences, and energies across sectors and verticals of the economy, for a truly inclusive economic growth trajectory\u201d in action and came to understand their tagline, \u201cThe power to empower.\u201d\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nGetting to know India through food.\nWe were graciously welcomed into the homes of Uma and Pinky, where we were served delectable meals highlighting the specialties of Hyderabad cuisine. We got to taste the best biryanis and a variety of dishes, capping off our meal with a refreshing paan. If there is anything that can easily show you how varied the cultures are within India, it would be the food\u2014the contrast of spices, ingredients, and cooking styles between southern and northern Indian cuisine were stark but each uniquely delicious.\nFEATURED STORIES\nOPINION\nRoque arrest serves ends of justice\nOPINION\nIs our ICC case dependent on insider witnesses?\nOPINION\nMAGA\nInnovation at Telangana state.\nWe also met with Mr. Jayesh Ranjan, special chief secretary of ITE&amp;C and I&amp;C at the Telangana State Secretariat who explained the state\u2019s laws and how it champions \u201cease of doing business,\u201d ensuring that all state employees efficiently process permits for businesses within the prescribed time frame. They have incentives in place to encourage businesses to invest in Telangana such as reduced power rates, training programs for manpower specific to your industry and providing infrastructure for innovation like the \u201cTelangana Academy of Skills and Knowledge\u201d (TASK), making Hyderabad a fast-growing business hub for tech and innovation in India. Telangana is just a decade old state but its economic progress exemplifies how political will can rapidly propel a whole state forward.\nFLO industrial park.\nWe visited the only industrial park in the world composed of 100 percent women-owned manufacturing businesses. A flagship project of FLO and FICCI, it is situated in Hyderabad on 50 acres of land and can accommodate 25 manufacturing plants. It is a perfect example of the impact an organization can have. Such scale can only be achieved through years of dedication, collective hard work, and determination to fulfill a life-changing vision.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nWomen must support other women.\nIn Delhi, we visited the FICCI HQ and sat in the same auditorium where Mahatma Gandhi once spoke to the distinguished 97-year-old organization. During the awarding ceremony, where our own Pacita Juan and Cristina Concepcion were honored for their achievements in business and women empowerment, FICCI-FLO president, Joyshree Das Verma, mentioned in her speech, \u201cwhen women come together, we are able to achieve much more than we can alone.\u201d This was the greatest lesson of our trip. When women help each other, whether it be through mentorship, collective action, being active members of an organization working on economic inclusivity for women, or simply being a support system for other women, we are able to multiply our impact exponentially.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nPowered By\n10 Sec\nSignal no. 4 up in Batanes due to Super Typhoon Leon | INQToday\nNext\nStay\nPast president Vinita Bimbhet said, \u201cwe hope to see a future where women are drivers of economic growth.\u201d We have seen this at work in India, on a massive scale. With organizations like PhilWEN and its member organizations, we hope to see the same in our country. Almost half of the population of the Philippines is female. Empowering the population that rears children, makes budgetary decisions for the family and reinvests in society, stands to impact our economy positively.

He has hurdled, healed, moved forward, and to date, has become a better, stronger, and wiser version of himself, while helping others in the process.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\u201c\nLaman na ako ng\nPasig Public Market,\nsimula\n7 years old\n.

In 2016, a friend from Singles for Christ group convinced him to be a GrabCar driver-partner, and that happened to be the wake-up call he was waiting for.&nbsp; Thus, in January 2017, Mendoza decided to ditch his wayward ways, come out clean, and become a GrabCar driver-partner.&nbsp; He never turned his back since.&nbsp;&nbsp;\nArticle continues after this advertisement\n&nbsp;\u201c\nUna kong nilabas yung sasakyan ng lola ko.

He commences his work at 1:00 in the afternoon and ends his day at dawn, making sure he has completed 12 hours of driving\n.&nbsp; \u201cImportante din na may sapat na pahinga.&nbsp; Nakakatuwa nga si\nGrab\neh, mag-a\n-alert\nyan kung sobra ka na sa oras o halos\n24 hours\nna ang byahe mo\n.&nbsp;\nRamdam mo talaga yung\nconcern\nnila sa amin.

I can feel the Grab\u2019s concern for us.&nbsp; The apps remind us that we cannot just drive nonstop),\u201d Mendoza smiled.&nbsp; So, he usually takes a breather every Wednesday for quality time with his family, while Sundays are spent to serve the Church, where he and his wife Lovely are active members of Couples for Christ.&nbsp;\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nMendoza claims he is able to bring home a sizable daily income for his family and because of Grab, they have finally renovated the house that they are currently renting in North Caloocan.&nbsp; \u201c\nNakapagpa-bubong ako ng bahay, nakabili ako ng cellphone, may pang-gasolina ako, nakabili kami ng gamit sa bahay, at nakapag-enrol sa Catholic school ang mga anak ko\n(I was able to have our roof fixed, buy a mobile phone, I have gasoline money, we got ourselves some home fixtures, and my children has successfully enrolled in a Catholic school),\u201d he smiled. Mendoza is more than determined to stay with Grab and to prove this, he has recently purchased his own car, has enrolled it with Grab, awaiting approval.&nbsp; He dreams of buying more units and eventually becoming a GrabCar operator so he could help provide jobs to those who need it.&nbsp;\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nEmpathy in action\nWhile Mendoza now lives far away from the place where he grew up in, he regularly returns to Pasig to help young children in the public market through his friend\u2019s non-profit organization called \u201c\nSagip Batampalengke\n\u201d.&nbsp; Embracing the lessons of his painful past, \u201cDaddy Oma\u201d (as the children fondly calls him) spreads kindness and inspiration, ensuring that they grow up as responsible young adults capable of making the right decisions in life, while safeguarding their souls from the lure of substance abuse and other vices.\n\u201cNakaawa ang mga bata noong una kong makita, natutulog sa palengke, nakahubad.

May mga\nolder batch\nna kaming natulungang magbago, maayos na sila ngayon sa pamilya nila\n(The plight of the children was dismal the first time I saw them. They sleep in the market, barenaked. They have parents but they choose to run away from home.&nbsp; There are several cases of teenage pregnancy.&nbsp; It\u2019s distressing.&nbsp; Our main goal is to get them off that place and turn them over to their families. We already helped an older batch change and now they\u2019re with their families),\u201d he revealed.&nbsp;\nRemembering the darkest episode of his adolescent life, Daddy Oma is committed to helping these children get back on their feet so they would never experience what he has gone through. They conduct weekly gatherings in the market where they bathe and feed the children and give them hygiene kits.&nbsp; The group also does volunteer weekly reading to enlighten these young ones about their obligations to God, the community, and to their families.&nbsp; But all these are not mere stop-gap measures as Mendoza and the group go above and beyond what the children need.&nbsp; \u201c\nTinuturuan din namin ang mga magulang kasi hindi natin alam kung ano ang dahilan bakit itong mga bata ay lumalayas sa bahay.&nbsp; Gina-\nguide\ndin namin ang pamilya nila, pati ang pagkuha ng\nbirth certificate\nnila para makapasok sa\nschool\n, inaasikaso namin.&nbsp; Dapat kasi\ninvolved\nang\npamilya para mabilis at kumpleto ang pagbabago\n(We also educate their parents because we don\u2019t know the reason why these kids run away from home. We guide their families, and even help acquire their birth certificates so they could go back to school.&nbsp; The family should be involved in the process, so the change is quick and complete),\u201d Mendoza explained.&nbsp;\nHe also relentlessly looks for sponsors and fortunately, there are people who donate rice, soaps, toothbrush, slippers, and funds.&nbsp; The Sagip Batampalengke has also earned the support even of the Pasig LGU.&nbsp; Seeing the organization\u2019s growth, Mendoza has enjoined his fellow GrabCar drivers\u2014under \u201cGrubee Friends\u201d, a 60-member group which he has organized\u2014who have since become his helping hand all his outreach programs, every summer and during the Holiday season. \u201c\nItong grupo namin\nay may\nbudget\nnaman talaga pang-outreach, pero\nnagbibigay rin kami ng\nsolicitation letters\nsa mga kaibigan namin at mga kumpanya tulad ng\nGrab,\npandagdag lang para mas marami kaming mabigyan ng tulong\n.\nIto ang nakakatuwa, nagbibigay talaga ng\ndonation\nsi\nGrab\nsa amin, bilang suporta sa aming magandang gawain\n(Our group has actually a budget for our outreach, but we still give out solicitation letters to friends and companies, as additional funds so we could help more children.

        "content": "In a concerted effort to fight cervical cancer, medical societies and health advocates are in full support of the reinstatement of the School-Based Immunization Program (SBIP) targeting girls aged 9 to 14 for HPV vaccination. This initiative is crucial, as cervical cancer remains a significant public health concern in the Philippines, claiming the lives of 12 women every day. The World Health Organization (WHO) emphasizes that cervical cancer is highly preventable through vaccination against human papillomavirus (HPV), the leading cause of this disease.\nMedical Societies and representatives from the national and local government shared insights on the cervical cancer burden in the Philippines and emphasize the need for aggressive vaccination efforts to combat human papillomavirus (HPV) leading cause of cervical cancer.\nIn a recent media forum titled Isang Boses Laban sa Cervical Cancer, Dr. Lulu Bravo Executive Director of the Philippine Foundation for Vaccination said, \u201cThe Foundation supports the reinstatement of the School-Based Immunization Program to prevent cervical cancer and meet WHO\u2019s 90% coverage target. We advocate for a coordinated national and local effort to prevent cervical cancer through vaccination, screening, and improved treatment access.\u201d\nThe need for comprehensive education about HPV and cervical cancer is paramount. Many parents remain unaware of the critical role vaccination plays in preventing the disease. Dr. Orlaud Tantengco shared insights from the DEFEAT HPV study, \u201cHPV viruses can be categorized into different types, much like a family tree. HPV 16 and 18 are among the more aggressive strains, classified as high-risk types because they are more likely to lead to cervical cancer. However, our study in showed that HPV 52 was the most prevalent genotype.\u201d\nDr. Ingrid Magnata, Jhpiego Country Program Manager, emphasized \u201cthe HPV vaccine has been available since 2006, and it was introduced in the public sector around 2014.\u201d&nbsp; However, experts urged the government to aim for protection against a wider array of genotypes.\n\u201cWe support the use of a cost-effective HPV vaccine that targets the most number of prevalent and emerging types, and advocate for catch-up vaccinations for girls who missed previous doses,\u201d Dr. Bravo added.\nUniting health and education\nCollaboration among various sectors is vital for a successful immunization initiative. The Department of Health (DOH) and the Department of Education (DepEd) are working together to ensure that health education and vaccination efforts reach children where they are\u2014at school. Dr. Carmina Vera, Medical Officer IV, Department of Health highlighted the importance of this partnership: \u201cWe aim to identify eligible populations to ensure equitable access for the most vulnerable groups in the country. By administering vaccines in schools, we can implement health education and collect parental consent more effectively.\u201d\nPanelists discussed the urgent need to expand access points for HPV vaccination as the country grapples with challenges in scaling up vaccine coverage.\nDr. Carmen Nievera, from the Pediatric Infectious Disease of the Philippines (PIDSP), emphasized the significance of the initiative, stating, \u201cInvesting in our children\u2019s health today will yield substantial benefits for the future. Vaccination against HPV is not just a personal health choice; it\u2019s a public health imperative that we must embrace collectively.\u201d\nIn addition to vaccination, enhanced cervical cancer screening is critical. While the HPV vaccine provides essential protection, regular screening can identify precancerous changes early, allowing for timely intervention.&nbsp;\nQuezon City District 1 Councilor Charm Ferrer, a cervical cancer patient herself and women\u2019s health advocate, highlighted the importance of disease knowledge.&nbsp; \u201cAnyone with a cervix can be at risk for cervical cancer, and unfortunately, we can all be carriers, regardless of gender,\u201d Coun. Ferrer said, \u201cWe hope our advocacy leads to a national effort to eliminate cervical cancer in the Philippines.\u201d\nOne community, one voice\nIn a collective effort to combat cervical cancer in the Philippines, various medical societies have come together to emphasize the importance of HPV vaccination. Their commitment statements reflect a shared dedication to increasing vaccination rates, enhancing screening programs, and providing accurate information about HPV and cervical cancer.\nDr. Rose Capeding, President of Philippine Foundation for Vaccination, led the commitment signing, advocating for intensified HPV vaccination as a crucial tool in the fight to eliminate cervical cancer.\nDr. Mildred Manalac-Mariano from the Philippine Medical Association (PMA) stated, \u201cWe support the promotion of the importance of vaccination against the human papillomavirus to prevent cervical cancer and decrease the cases.\u201d&nbsp;\nDr. Martha Millar-Aquino of the Philippine Infectious Disease Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology (PIDSOG) pledged, \u201cWe are dedicated to implementing comprehensive strategies to tackle this disease head on.&nbsp; We pledge to increase the screening rates among women.\u201d&nbsp;\nDr. Kristine Bajandi, Philippine Society for Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (PSMID) added, \u201cCollaborative efforts among stakeholders are essential to ensuring access to cost-effective vaccines to protect future generations from vaccine-preventable diseases.\u201d\nDr. Deborah Red from the Society of Adolescent Medicine of the Philippines (SAMPI) and Philippine Society of Adolescent Medicine Specialists (PSAMS) affirmed, \u201cWe commit to provide accurate information on HPV vaccination to healthcare providers, adolescents, and parents.\u201d&nbsp;\nDr. Therese Mallen of the Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology Society of the Philippines (PAGSPHIL) highlighted the need for empowerment through education, stating, \u201cWe advocate for empowerment of adolescents through early comprehensive reproductive health education and awareness about cervical cancer and HPV.\u201d\nDr. Joan Millonado from the Philippine Ambulatory Pediatric Association (PAPA) expressed optimism about ongoing health literacy initiatives: \u201cThrough these initiatives, such as our continuing medical education activities, we are moving a few steps closer towards our goal of achieving cervical cancer elimination and promoting health across all populations.\u201d\nFinally, Dr. Margaret Alfonso also from PAPA reinforced their mission, stating, \u201cWe advocate for preventing cervical cancer through vaccination.\u201d\nThe united commitment of these medical societies marks a significant step toward enhancing HPV vaccination rates and ultimately reducing cervical cancer incidence in the Philippines. The call to action is clear: community engagement, education, and a united effort to promote preventive healthcare are essential in the fight against cervical cancer. As advocates rally for the reinstatement of the SBIP and the promotion of HPV vaccination, the message remains strong\u2014cervical cancer is preventable, and collective action is needed to safeguard the health of Filipinos.\nADVT.\nThis article is brought to you by Cervical Cancer Patients.\nRead more stories here:\nIndustry Stakeholders support ESG Agriculture \u2013 PNOC\u2019s game-changing Partnership\nVista Land Developments offer breathtaking panoramas of Silang and Tagaytay\n\u2018Elevating my every day at home\u2019\nREAD MORE\nREAD NEXT\nTeodoro: Bamban Pogo\u2019s proximity to military base shouldR...\nVance-Walz clash: US VP debate pits hillbilly energy vs \u2018...\nEDITORS' PICK\nUAAP Finals: UP's Reyland Torres not suspended for Game 3\nTrump is Time\u2019s Person of the Year, rings NYSE\u2019s opening bell\nEXPLAINER: Depleted uranium and why it\u2019s a national security threat?\nTolentino leads awarding of land titles to 4,029 Bukidnon farmers\nSteve Kerr rips officiating in Warriors NBA Cup loss to Rockets\n2 more hotel workers charged for the death of Liam Payne\nMOST READ\nTeodoro says petitions to cancel candidacy \u2018political maneuvering\u2019\nSofronio Vasquez looks back on Rey Valera's advice after 'The Voice' US win\nPhilHealth\u2019s zero subsidy for 2025 an insult to members \u2013 group\nINQToday: Grijaldo skips House quad panel probe for the 4th time; held in contempt\nFollow\n@FMangosingINQ\non Twitter\n-->\nView comments",

MVP revives Smart Money\nBUSINESS\nTech tycoon Dennis Uy\u2019s air navigation pitch rejected\nBUSINESS\nPSE entry so hard for 400 firms\nKarlos Naidas, the 34-year-old CEO of content aggregator platform PIXEL by Eplayment, says the growth of the creative economy in the Philippines gained more traction during the pandemic.\n\u201cThe substantial growth in the Philippine creator economy has been evident in the sizable increase of content creators \u2026 Not only does this sector provide an avenue for creators to express themselves, but it is also a revenue-generating gig as there are many ways to earn in content creation,\u201d he explains.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nJuan Lorenzo Marco \u2014CONTRIBUTED PHOTOS\n&nbsp;\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nSuch is the case of Juan Lorenzo Marco, 34, who started dabbling in content creation during the pandemic. As marketing and platforms manager at the Cultural Center of the Philippines, he was tasked to create a new space to share art even during lockdown.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nAs his research led him to the world of streaming, he got fascinated with the infinite possibilities. As an avid gamer, he started livestreaming while playing Mobile Legends. Over time, he built a community of followers.\nMarco, who goes by the username Uncle JU, is now a full-time content creator with nearly 70,000 followers across all social media platforms. He says that brand collaborations and events such as \u201cshoutcasting\u201d gaming tournaments have been a steady source of revenue.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nHe attributes his success to his participation in Project Upload, Eplayment\u2019s first creator-centric event in 2023 that was designed to provide content creators insights into the industry.\n\u201cThere were other creators who were also invited and they tackled other vital topics. It also became an avenue for creators like me to collaborate with others who share the same passion,\u201d he recounts.\nMoreover, Eplayment has played a major role in monetizing Marco\u2019s online presence. He uses both platforms\u2014Eplayment and PIXEL\u2014to earn more from tips and donations from viewers and supporters.\nYou can feel the love for aspiring creators from this organization, he says. \u201cThey have been part of my milestones. They helped me grow my connections and made me believe that I have a future with this industry,\u201d he adds.\nMarco aka Uncle JU is all dressed up for cosplay.\n&nbsp;\nChallenges and opportunities\nThe creator economy, Naidas explains, has led to unique opportunities for brands and consumers to build meaningful connections. \u201cFor brands, content creation is vital as it helps build their identity further by appearing more organic and personal through influencers or creators that engage with audiences on their behalf.\u201d\n\u201cQuality content can influence purchases as they produce informative and engaging content that can assist potential customers in making informed decisions, ultimately leading to sales conversions for consumer brands,\u201d he explains in an email interview.\nAccording to Naidas, the most common source of income of creators is brand partnership, whereby they charge talent or posting fees.\nAs the ecosystem continues to thrive, Naidas identifies a pain point in the monetization process of content creation: creators often encounter a snag in accessing traditional financial services. An \u201corganic and integrated platform that will serve as both the payment gateway and processor\u201d is deemed necessary to help creators access their earnings in real time.\nEplayment seeks to fill the gap by developing a payment gateway for content creators. Eplayment was first established in 2019 for the e-sports community as a producer of small-scale content features for up-and-coming gamers. From an e-wallet tailored to the needs of gamers, it has become a channel for creators to thrive.\nNaidas says PIXEL offers a comprehensive creator suite customized to deliver seamless payment tools and fast banking solutions. To speed up content monetization, it offers real-time payouts, direct payments from fans, customizable subscription system and loan opportunities.\nUsers can send \u201cPIX\u201d or the in-app credits as donations to their favorite creators. Creators, in turn, can easily cash out credits through the Eplayment app and other supported e-wallets.\nMOBILE-READY Screenshot of Eplayment dashboard.\n&nbsp;\nCommunity-building\nTogether, Eplayment and PIXEL offer creator connect programs wherein a diverse set of community-building activities are collated for creators and fans alike to \u201cfoster new relationships and share knowledge and expertise on the craft.\u201d\n\u201cWe nurture our community with encouraging bits of advice on being true to one\u2019s branding, fostering a community that will support them and of course, stimulating creative freedom, which is shared from one creator to another,\u201d Naidas says.\nIn addition, PIXEL enables its creators to enhance audience reach through content aggregators. Naidas describes content aggregators as \u201cpivotal players in the creator economy [by] simplifying the process of putting out one\u2019s content to the broad market by having a centralized location.\u201d\n\u201cThe user-friendly interface allows seamless navigation, streamlining the content creation journey and enabling users to prioritize their creativity without distractions,\u201d he adds.\nBy capitalizing on the growing volume and diversity of content generated by creators, he says aggregators can leverage user engagement to drive revenue growth for the business.\nNaidas says that stiff competition in the creative economy has driven more creators to use technology to help maximize the engagement with the audience after posting. Artificial intelligence enables creators to keep tabs on trends and easily adjust to the algorithm of their online activity, he says.\nPIXEL now has a community of 3,873 creators. But Naidas wants to bring in more creators under his wing. \u201cPIXEL seeks to accommodate both starting and veteran creators, ensuring that newbies can ease into content creation and more established creators continue to earn sufficient revenue,\u201d he says.\nThey earn through transaction fees that are applied when users utilize the Eplayment wallet and PIXEL. There is a flat fee of 5 percent on all transactions across PIXEL\u2019s available features.\nYour subscription could not be saved.

These events celebrate social dynamism as we navigate new routes brought about by changes in technology.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nSpatial challenges\nSpace design challenges go beyond catering to the collective spirit.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThe cumulative nature of space production brings in the factors of time and uncertainty as convergence places are created. Design evaluation will have to be contextualized within an ensemble of structures that will perform together in a neighborhood setting. Such harmony may be achieved through an informed imagination of a future co-defined by different initiatives, motivations, and aspirations.\nLand use planning and zoning in 16th century-constructed Machu Pichu reflect how the Incan community functioned as a collective.\nAs people and spaces come together, place affinities are developed, and buildings imbibe characters that become part of a society\u2019s consciousness. Urban settings are outcomes of social relations that constantly reconfigure as values, economies, and power structures change. The relativity of social connections, therefore, calls for built forms that can easily transform to respond to new contexts.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nVulnerability as a key defining attribute of humanity may be tapped as a strength rather than a weakness when building and developing land for people.\nBeing vulnerable has conventionally been defined as being the target of attacks and the probability of getting hurt. The positive side of vulnerability when it comes to designing spaces connotes openness to new people-place paradigms. Innovations are borne out of the willingness to fail while in pursuit of breakthroughs in design and development.\nParadoxes and outcomes\nWith the advent of industrialization came the compartmentalization of roles and contributions to the collective. The establishment of professions as mutually exclusive domains creates some sense of order in the space ideation and delivery process.\nHowever, the opportunity to \u201ccreate\u201d in the true sense of the word may also become limited by rigid role delineations that prevent the inter-lapping of specialized knowledge sets. The melding of thoughts coming from different academic domains has yet to be fully complemented by education frameworks that allow the crossing of disciplinary boundaries. Seeking out what one does not possess or have no mastery of is among the core attributes of humanity.\nPhysical borders defined by administrative and legal parameters also create environment management systems that run counter to the notion of ecology that accounts for life that thrives on interconnectedness.\nPeople account for the temporal qualities of places, as in this shopping street in Seoul.\nBorder conflicts, the not-in-my-backyard frame of mind, and the traditional two-dimensional land use planning negate the bigger realities where human life is contextualized. Shared air sheds, watersheds, and critical habitats require us to zoom out for interventions to be appropriate and sustainable.\nThe myopic bases of design standards and the bureaucratic processes for enforcing design and development laws manifest in static places that refuse to grow with the times. Dynamic social relations call for equally dynamic standards and procedural systems if we are looking to experience responsive and relevant built environments.\nNext-level design responses\nMuch has been seen as translations of the goal of matching human needs with designed spaces.\nMaslow\u2019s Hierarchy of Needs has undoubtedly figured in architectural programming that involves user and activity analysis. Real estate development has leveled up as designers strove to deliver not just spaces but places that promote productivity, community spirit, and a sense of pride.\nPutting humanity at the core of architecture, urban design, and planning can further be upgraded beyond mere accommodation. Human beings as an evolving species must be allowed to discover new avenues for growth and collective progress through spaces that positively provoke. Advancement is spurred by discovery aided by the intent to break boundaries.\nNeighborhood forms are products of the collective performance and cumulative construction of buildings over time.\nUnderstanding, challenging, imagining alternatives in the designed and built environment fields are key to instigating changes in our private and public spaces. Provocations need not be internally generated. Thought process stimulants coming from other fields such as psychology, medicine, sports, and music can revolutionize space creation. This makes design products active rather than reactive interventions.\nThe social dimension is often regarded as the messy part of design and planning because of the difficulty of pinning down assumptions. People-related variables are relatively more difficult to model compared to elements in the physical world.\nIt is challenging to establish control when analyzing social relations.

        "content": "Santos (center) with Dantes and wife Marian Rivera \u2014photos from VILMA SANTOS/ INSTAGRAM\nActress\nVilma Santos\nsaid she has mixed feelings about the news that she was recently nominated for the title of National Artist for Film and Broadcast.\nSantos said she was surprised about the move of Aktor: League of Filipino Actors, headed by its chairperson Dingdong Dantes, to lead the nomination and organize a formal media announcement about it on June 29. The actress also claimed to be grateful to Aktor and to 27 other groups that endorsed her nomination \u201cfor their trust, support and effort to make this happen.\u201d\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nHowever, Santos is also sad because news that Aktor and Dantes are being bashed by some on social media has reached her, and that she found this to be \u201creally unfair.\u201d\nFEATURED STORIES\nENTERTAINMENT\nSofronio Vasquez looks back on Rey Valera's advice after 'The Voice' US win\nENTERTAINMENT\nPriscilla Meirelles wins new beauty title, Teresa Loyzaga fulfills pageantry dreams\nENTERTAINMENT\nSelena Gomez now engaged to Benny Blanco\n\u201cI\u2019m currently in the States for a vacation with my family. I was unaware of the nomination and the press conference because I was on a cruise with my family and there was no Internet there. I was only able to watch the whole thing on Facebook during the weekend,\u201d Santos told Inquirer Entertainment in a Viber interview on Monday afternoon (Manila time).\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t explain the happiness I felt when I first found out. I am humbled. My heart is full, especially when I watched Dingdong speak about me. I immediately texted him to say \u2018thank you.\u2019 I also learned that there was even a presentation about my life as an actress and public servant, and that there were messages of support from industry colleagues like Charo (Santos-Concio) and Tirso Cruz III, who even attended the event,\u201d she added.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\n\u201cI\u2019m very grateful to friends who really worked hard for my nomination. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t want them to experience anything bad as a result of the whole thing. I know there are a lot of industry people who deserve to be called national artist, but we all see their effort to nominate me. For that, I already consider myself a winner.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\n\u201cI was caught unaware. The only thing I can promise is my continued support to the entertainment industry. Even before this nomination happened, I have been very active with Cine Icon, a project of the CCP (Cultural Center of the Philippines). This is because after 60 years, I feel that it\u2019s payback time.\u201d\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nSantos said she made sure to attend most of the public screenings of her restored films, especially those held in schools and universities. \u201cI also participate actively during talk-back sessions. I want Gen Z to watch the movies from before. I try to explain to them what our industry was like then and why we made those kinds of movies before,\u201d she began. \u201cThis has already become my advocacy long before this campaign for my being a national artist began.\u201d\nVilma Santos-Recto\n&nbsp;\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nLoud cheers\nSantos then said she is finding it hard to understand why Dantes was getting bashed for Aktor\u2019s decision to nominate her. \u201cI hope these people will stop. I would actively defend Dingdong and the group against them. I\u2019m not expecting everybody to like me, but please don\u2019t bash those who do. This is really unfair.\u201d\nShe said she draws strength from her No.1 supporters, her family. \u201cWhen I got nominated for best actress at the Metro Manila Film Festival for \u2018When I Met You in Tokyo,\u2019 they teased me by saying, \u2018Ibigay mo na ang trophy sa iba. Iba naman.\u2019 But when my name was called, they cheered the loudest,\u201d recalled Santos, adding that she and husband, Finance Secretary Ralph Recto, have yet to talk about the negative online comments.\n\u201cMy family is everything. Everything I have, I offer to them. There\u2019s also this bigger family of mine in the movie industry, and an even bigger family from when I was a public servant in Batangas. They are my life, my everything,\u201d Santos said.\nHer trip to the United States is an annual thing that had long been planned. \u201cMy siblings have been living here for over 40 years now,\u201d said Santos, who was in Los Angeles, California, at the time of the interview. \u201cBecause of the pandemic, we didn\u2019t get to see each other for five years. We\u2019re trying to make up for lost time. Since Ralph is busy, he could only stay for 10 days.\u201d\nSantos plans to return to Manila in mid-July.\nAktor: League for Filipino Actors chairperson Dingdong Dantes \u2014MARINEL CRUZ\nA gift\n\u201cI will forever be grateful, until my last breath, to those who gave their trust to me and supported me by means of their endorsements. This is priceless. I consider this a gift. They said this will take a year and a half to process. Can you just imagine the effort of those who will deliberate on this? Again, for this alone, I consider myself a winner,\u201d she said.\nMeanwhile, Dantes claimed that there were over 20 groups from various sectors advocating for Santos\u2019 nomination.\n\u201cAktor is just one of them,\u201d he stressed. \u201cMovies are one of the primary cultural forces contributing to the formation of the Philippine nation. They reflect the struggles, challenges, triumphs and also the future we aspire for. In this context, we believe that movies serve as our representations and aspirations. Actors, on the other hand, act as the nation\u2019s storytellers.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cWe imagine all of us being in the persona of a proud actor. This is the root of our organization. For us, a proud actor, first of all, is a paragon of professionalism. He is also the protector of the community, a cultural champion, and most importantly, a nation builder. Our vision is brought to life by this person. She is one of our members and is part of our board of advisers,\u201d he added.\n\u201cToday, we celebrate Vilma Santos, a name synonymous to versatility, excellence and unparalleled craftsmanship in Philippine cinema. For over 60 years, she has graced the silver screen with an incomparable body of work. She has portrayed a diverse array of characters that showed her immense talent. She is the most awarded actress in Philippine cinema history,\u201d Dantes said.\nYour subscription could not be saved.

She has continuously evolved, by tackling challenging roles that not just inspire but also provoke thought. From when she started in \u2018Trudis Liit,\u201d she has also immortalized beloved fantasy characters on the big screen like \u2018Darna\u2019 and \u2018Dyesebel.\u2019\u201d\nRead More\nREAD NEXT\nClaudine Barretto flattered, amused by viral \u2018thank you so m...\nThai actor Max Nattapol open to doing \u2018BL\u2019 series in PH\nEDITORS' PICK\nTransman Jesi Corcuera gives birth to baby girl\nUN General Assembly calls for 'unconditional' ceasefire in Gaza\nFilipinos urged to go digital in giving Christmas cash gifts\nVP Sara Duterte wrong to say DOJ is 'biased' \u2013 exec\n2 more hotel workers charged for the death of Liam Payne\nSelena Gomez now engaged to Benny Blanco\nMOST READ\nTeodoro says petitions to cancel candidacy \u2018political maneuvering\u2019\nSofronio Vasquez looks back on Rey Valera's advice after 'The Voice' US win\n3 persons, including 3-month-old baby, killed in Maguindanao ambush\nPhilHealth\u2019s zero subsidy for 2025 an insult to members \u2013 group\nFollow\n@FMangosingINQ\non Twitter\n-->\nView comments",

        "content": "Mining companies are calling on industry stakeholders to strengthen support for responsible mining, underlining the industry\u2019s untapped potential to further drive economic growth and support social development at the national and local level, while fostering environmental stewardship.\nMining company representatives echoed the sentiment as the industry gathered to launch\n\u201cLiving with a Brighter Future,\u201d\na documentary developed as part of the industry\u2019s\nBetter Mining, Brighter Future\ncommunication and advocacy\ncampaign. The campaign, which aims to raise awareness about responsible mining, is a joint initiative of the Chamber of Mines of the Philippines; the Philippine Nickel Industry Association; the Chamber of Mines \u2013 Caraga; the Alliance of Responsible MIners and Operators \u2013 Visayas; the Eastern Rizal Minders Association; the Mindanao Association of Responsible Quarry Operators Foundation, Inc.; and the Philippine Mining &amp; Exploration Association.\nAtty. Mike Toledo, Chairperson of the Chamber of Mines of the Philippines, gave the Welcome Remarks at the launch of the \u201cLiving with a Brighter Future\u201d documentary. The documentary aims to raise awareness about the responsible mining practices of mining companies in the Philippines. The documentary is part of the Better Mining, Brighter Future campaign, a joint initiative of the Chamber of Mines of the Philippines; the Philippine Nickel Industry Association; the Chamber of Mines \u2013 Caraga; the Alliance of Responsible MIners and Operators \u2013 Visayas; the Eastern Rizal Miners Association; the Mindanao Association of Responsible Quarry Operators Foundation, Inc.; and the Philippine Mining &amp; Exploration Association.\nThe\n\u201cLiving with a Brighter Future\u201d\ndocumentary provides a comprehensive narrative of responsible mining practices, portraying the collaborative efforts between mining companies, local communities, and local government units. Through the eyes of company representatives and community members, the documentary showcased the positive socio-economic impact and environmental sustainability initiatives of the mining industry across Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao.&nbsp;\n\u201cMining companies have made substantial contributions to local communities through its Social Development and Management Program or SDMP. Additionally, the industry\u2019s environmental commitments have been significant,\u201d said Atty. Mike Toledo, Chairperson of the Chamber of Mines of the Philippines.&nbsp;\nFrom 2002 and 2027, mining companies have pledged a total of PHP 31.81 billion towards SDMP initiatives, with PHP 20.3 billion earmarked for the period spanning 2002 to 2024. Since 2002, SDMPs have positively impacted over 1,160 barangays across the country.\nMr. Pocholo Domondom, Partner at PwC, gave the Keynote Presentation at the launch of the \u201cLiving with a Brighter Future\u201d documentary. The documentary aims to raise awareness about the responsible mining practices of mining companies in the Philippines. The documentary is part of the Better Mining, Brighter Future campaign, a joint initiative of the Chamber of Mines of the Philippines; the Philippine Nickel Industry Association; the Chamber of Mines \u2013 Caraga; the Alliance of Responsible MIners and Operators \u2013 Visayas; the Eastern Rizal Miners Association; the Mindanao Association of Responsible Quarry Operators Foundation, Inc.; and the Philippine Mining &amp; Exploration Association.\nSDMPs serve as a collaborative platform where mining companies, the local government, and the community come together to bridge the gaps in both physical and social infrastructures within the communities they operate in. Through constant consultations with the host and neighboring communities, mining projects are able to meet the needs of residents and offer impactful solutions that yield both immediate and long-term benefits. During the event\u2019s panel discussion, industry leaders highlighted initiatives such as employment creation, education and healthcare investments, infrastructure development, and the preservation of indigenous culture through programs like the IP Culture Revitalization Program.\nOn the other hand, the Philippine mining industry has provided PHP 387.81 billion, as of December 2023, to environmental protection and enhancement programs. In addition, the mining industry has committed PHP 6.72 billion for the rehabilitation of decommissioned mines. One concrete example of the initiatives of the industry is the number of trees planted where, as of December 2023, more than 50 million seedlings covering almost 45 hectares of land have been planted by the industry. Of these planted trees, approximately 90% have survived.\n(From left to right: Jasmin Romero, Journalist; Atty. Joan Adaci-Cattiling, President of OceanaGold Philippines, Inc.; Joey Ayson, President, Philippine Mining &amp; Exploration Association; Atty. Dante Bravo, President, Philippine Nickel Industry Association; and Engr. Francis Felizardo, President and CEO, Montepiedra Aggregates Corporation)\nMining industry leaders served as panelists at the launch of the Living with a Brighter Future documentary. The leaders discussed the various Social Development and Management Programs, Environmental Protection and Enhancement Programs, as well as the economic contributions of the industry. The Living with a Brighter Future documentary, which aims to raise awareness about the responsible mining practices of mining companies in the Philippines, is part of the Better Mining, Brighter Future campaign, a joint initiative of the Chamber of Mines of the Philippines; the Philippine Nickel Industry Association; the Chamber of Mines \u2013 Caraga; the Alliance of Responsible MIners and Operators \u2013 Visayas; the Eastern Rizal Miners Association; the Mindanao Association of Responsible Quarry Operators Foundation, Inc.; and the Philippine Mining &amp; Exploration Association.\n\u201cThrough innovation and modern technologies, the mining sector is reducing its environmental footprint and paving the way for a future where economic development and environmental stewardship go hand in hand. Progressive rehabilitation efforts, coupled with investments in reforestation and environmental protection, demonstrate the industry\u2019s commitment to responsible stewardship of natural resources,\u201d Atty. Toledo added.\nThe documentary highlighted that the industry contributed PHP 170.1 billion (in current prices) to the Philippines\u2019 GDP in 2022 alone and employed over 212,000 individuals as of 2023.\nIn his keynote presentation, PWC Partner, Mr. Pocholo Domondon further reiterated the industry\u2019s economic contributions citing NEDA\u2019s 2023 Philippine Development Report which stated that while there was an 18.5 percent decline in the total net FDI, significant contributions were still noted for manufacturing, transportation and storage, and mining and quarrying in terms of increased net equity FDI. In the same report, the government also listed the fiscal regime for mining as one of the tax measures that the government is discussing as part of efforts to achieve its fiscal targets until 2028. Further, the government has also cited the mining sector, along with the manufacturing sector, as essential sectors expected to support the government\u2019s 4PH program. The 4PH program aims to build 1 million housing units yearly until 2028.\nAs the industry moves forward, their collective commitment underscores a shared vision for a sustainable future where responsible mining plays a pivotal role in driving economic growth, fostering social development, and preserving the environment for generations to come.&nbsp;\nThis article is brought to you by the Chamber of Mines of the Philippines; the Philippine Nickel Industry Association; the Chamber of Mines \u2013 Caraga; the Alliance of Responsible Miners and Operators \u2013 Visayas; the Eastern Rizal Miners Association; the Mindanao Association of Responsible Quarry Operators Foundation, Inc.; and the Philippine Mining &amp; Exploration Association.\nRead more Business stories:\nPag-IBIG members save record-high P28.75B in Q1 2024, up 36%; MP2 Savings reach P15.56B, up 48%\nWilcon Depot Koronadal \u2013 A gem rises in Mindanao\u2019s crown city\nInLife 2023 parent company revenues, net income and assets up; records strong 2024 1Q performance\nADVT\nREAD MORE\nREAD NEXT\nA piece of Japan you can bring home: First NITORI opens in MIT...\nSTI profit surges 93% on higher enrollment\nEDITORS' PICK\nSofronio Vasquez looks back on Rey Valera\u2019s advice after \u2018The Voice\u2019 US win\nKababaihan donates TV sets for women's jail's ALS program\nPH men\u2019s football team settles for draw vs Myanmar in Mitsubishi Cup\n2 more hotel workers charged for the death of Liam Payne\nPriscilla Meirelles wins new beauty title, Teresa Loyzaga fulfills pageantry dreams\nFiesta Se\u00f1or 2025: Registration for Fluvial Procession begins\nMOST READ\nTeodoro says petitions to cancel candidacy \u2018political maneuvering\u2019\nSofronio Vasquez looks back on Rey Valera's advice after 'The Voice' US win\n3 persons, including 3-month-old baby, killed in Maguindanao ambush\nPhilHealth\u2019s zero subsidy for 2025 an insult to members \u2013 group\nFollow\n@FMangosingINQ\non Twitter\n-->\nView comments",

The daily struggle to find work for Chinese immigrants living illegally in Flushing is a far cry from the picture Donald Trump and other Republicans have sought to paint about them. Asian advocacy organizations say they\u2019re concerned the exaggerated rhetoric could fuel further harassment against Asians in the U.S. Associated Press\nNEW YORK \u2014 It was 7 a.m. on a recent Friday when Wang Gang, a 36-year-old Chinese immigrant, jostled for a day job in New York City\u2019s Flushing neighborhood.\nWhen a potential employer pulled up near the street corner, home to a Chinese bakery and pharmacy, Wang and dozens of other men swarmed around the car. They were hoping to be picked for work on a construction site, at a farm, as a mover \u2014 anything that would pay.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nWang had no luck, even as he waited for two more hours. It would be another day without a job since he crossed the southern U.S. border illegally in February, seeking better financial prospects than he had in his hometown of Wuhan, China.\nFEATURED STORIES\nGLOBALNATION\nBamban under Alice Guo late in submitting cash advance vouchers \u2013 COA\nGLOBALNATION\nJollibee Group\u2019s inclusive business practice boosts Filipino farmers\u2019 productivity, income\nGLOBALNATION\n2 more PH nature reserves tagged of \u2018internationl importance\u2019\nREAD:\nUS official sees no link between Chinese migrants at border and fentanyl\nThe daily struggle of Chinese immigrants in Flushing is a far cry from the picture former President Donald Trump and other Republicans have sought to paint of them as a coordinated group of \u201cmilitary-age\u201d men who have come to the United States to build an \u201carmy\u201d and attack America.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nSince the start of the year, as the Chinese newcomers have been trying to find their footing in the U.S., Trump has alluded to \u201cfighting-age\u201d or \u201cmilitary-age\u201d Chinese men at least six times and suggested at least twice that they were forming a migrant \u201carmy.\u201d It\u2019s a talking point that is being amplified in conservative media and on social platforms.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\n\u201cThey\u2019re coming in from China \u2014 31, 32,000 over the last few months \u2014 and they\u2019re all military age and they mostly are men,\u201d Trump said during a campaign rally last month in Schnecksville, Pennsylvania. \u201cAnd it sounds like to me, are they trying to build a little army in our country? Is that what they\u2019re trying to do?\u201d\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nREAD:\nDeath in NY highlights surge in Chinese migrants crossing US-Mexico border\nAs Trump and others exploit a surge in Chinese border crossings and real concerns about China\u2019s geopolitical threat to further their political aims, Asian advocacy organizations worry the rhetoric could encourage further harassment and violence toward the Asian community. Asian people in the U.S. already experienced a spike in hate incidents fueled by xenophobic rhetoric during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\n\u201cTrump\u2019s dehumanizing rhetoric and blatant attacks against immigrant communities will, without question, only fuel more hate against not only Chinese immigrants but all Asian Americans in the U.S.,\u201d Cynthia Choi, co-founder of Stop AAPI Hate and co-executive director of Chinese for Affirmative Action, said in a statement to The Associated Press. \u201cIn the midst of an already inflamed political climate and election year, we know all too well how harmful such rhetoric can be.\u201d\nGregg Orton, national director of the National Council of Asian Pacific Americans, said many Asian American communities remain \u201cgripped by fear\u201d and that some Asians still feel uncomfortable about taking public transportation.\n\u201cTo know that we might be staring down another round of that, it\u2019s pretty sobering,\u201d he said.\n\u2018This trip is deadly\u2019\nWang, who traveled several weeks from Ecuador to the southern U.S. border, then spent 48 hours in an immigration detention facility before heading to Flushing, said the idea that Chinese migrants were building a military \u201cdoes not exist\u201d among the immigrants he has met.\n\u201cIt is impossible that they would walk on foot for over one month\u201d for that purpose, he said. \u201cWe came here to make money.\u201d\nImmigrants who spoke to the AP in Flushing, a densely populated Chinese cultural enclave in Queens, said they came to the U.S. to escape poverty and financial losses from China\u2019s strict lockdown during the pandemic, or to escape the threat of imprisonment in a repressive society where they couldn\u2019t speak or exercise their religion freely.\nMany said they continue to struggle to get by. Life in the U.S. is not what they had imagined.\nSince late 2022 \u2014 when China\u2019s three-year COVID-19 lockdown began to lift \u2014 the U.S. has seen a sharp rise in the number of Chinese migrants. In 2023, U.S. authorities arrested more than 37,000 Chinese nationals at the U.S.-Mexico border, more than 10 times the previous year\u2019s number. In December alone, border officials arrested 5,951 Chinese nationals on the southern border, a record monthly high, before the number trended down during the first three months of this year.\nThe U.S. and China just recently began cooperating again to deport Chinese immigrants who were in the country illegally.\nYet with tens of thousands of Chinese newcomers who have crossed into the U.S. illegally, there has been no evidence that they have tried to mount a military force or training network.\nIt\u2019s true that the bulk of those who have come are single adults, according to federal data. While the data doesn\u2019t include gender, there are more men than women on the perilous route, which typically involves catching a flight to South America and then making the long, arduous trek north to the U.S. border.\nChinese immigrants in Flushing said one reason men may be coming alone in higher numbers is the expense \u2014 often more than $10,000 per person to cover airfare, lodging, payments to local guides and bribes to police in countries along their journey. Another could be China\u2019s longtime family planning policy that skewed the gender ratio toward males.\nThere\u2019s also the danger, said a 35-year-old Chinese man who only gave his family name of Yin because he was concerned about the safety of his wife and children, who remain in China.\nHe had arrived in Flushing in late April, five weeks after he left the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen. He had traveled through Panama\u2019s dangerous Darien Gap jungle and across Mexico. Signs of the journey were still fresh: His hair was messy, skin tanned with fine wrinkles, and his cardigan, once white, had not been washed for weeks.\n\u201cThis trip is deadly. People die. The trip isn\u2019t suitable for women \u2014 it\u2019s not suitable for anyone,\u201d said Yin.\nHe said that as the breadwinner, he came alone, with the hope his family could join him later.\n\u2018Chasing a better life\u2019\nWhile some in China have chosen to leave through investment schemes or talent programs in developed nations, those without resources set off for Latin America after learning from social media posts about the journey north.\nUpon arriving, most of them fan out to large cities such as Los Angeles, Chicago and New York with well-established Chinese communities, where they hope to get work and start a new life.\nImmigrants who arrived in Flushing said they came to America to escape China, not to fight on its behalf.\nThirty-six-year-old Chen Wang, from the southeastern Chinese province of Fujian, said he decided to come to the U.S. in late 2021 after he posted comments critical of the ruling party on Twitter. He was admonished by local police.\n\u201cI feared that I could be locked up, so I came to America,\u201d Chen said.\nMore than two years later, he is still unemployed and lives in a tent in the woods that he has made into a home. He built a fence from dead branches and dug a ditch so he could hand-wash his laundry and wash himself.\nHe said life in the U.S. has fallen short of his expectations, but he hopes someday to get legal status so he can travel freely around the world and live a simple life in a self-built cabin.\nChen, who served briefly in the Chinese military two decades ago, said he mostly encountered people from the bottom of Chinese society during his trek through Central America. He met no one else who had served in the Chinese military and described his fellow Chinese on the journey as simply people \u201cchasing a better life.\u201d\nLong history of Asian stereotypes\nTo be sure, U.S. intelligence leaders have grave concerns about the threat China\u2019s authoritarian government poses to the country through its espionage, military capabilities and more. There also have been crimes committed by Chinese immigrants, including the arrest in March of a Chinese national breaching a military base in California, but there has been no evidence to support the assertion that migrants from China are coming to the U.S. to fight Americans.\nDeputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell called the Chinese nationals \u201ceconomic migrants\u201d during an April town hall meeting hosted by the National Committee on U.S.-China Relations.\nChina has said it strongly opposes illegal immigration, and police there have arrested some who have tried to leave. Social media posts that offer advice and guides to come to the U.S. illegally have been censored in China. Instead, there are posts warning about dangers along the way and racial discrimination in the U.S.\nChina\u2019s foreign ministry told the AP that Trump\u2019s claims of a Chinese migrant army were \u201can egregious mismatch of the facts.\u201d The Department of Homeland Security didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\nSteven Cheung, communications director for the Trump campaign, said in an emailed statement that every American should be concerned about military-age Chinese men crossing into the U.S.\n\u201cThese individuals have not been vetted or screened, and we have no idea who they are affiliated with or what their intention is,\u201d Cheung said. \u201cThis sets a dangerous precedent for bad actors and potentially nefarious individuals to exploit Joe Biden\u2019s porous border to send countless military-aged men into the United States completely unfettered.\u201d\nThe army-building narrative has been shared by many other conservatives.\n\u201cThey are fighting-age males, primarily single, and you know, this isn\u2019t a coincidence,\u201d Republican Rep. Mike Garcia of California said during a Fox Business interview last month, nodding when host Maria Bartiromo suggested the immigrants could later be used as \u201csaboteurs\u201d if Chinese President Xi Jinping \u201cdirects that.\u201d\nSapna Cheryan, a psychology professor at the University of Washington, said the claims about Chinese migrants \u2014 made without evidence \u2014 build on a long history of pervasive stereotypes that Asian people do not belong in the country, ideas that have fueled acts of violence against Asian Americans.\n\u201cIf that rhetoric is happening again, one thing we might be able to predict is, well, people will probably take that and feel emboldened to engage in these heinous acts,\u201d she said.\nLi Kai, also known as Khaled, a 44-year-old Muslim from Tangshan in the northern Hebei province, a city close to Beijing, said he was worried about Trump\u2019s statements regarding illegal immigration and Muslims, but said he has no choice other than to make his new life in the U.S. work.\nHe was one of the few who made the trip with his family. He shares a bunk bed and sofa with his wife and two sons in a temporary home in Flushing where he has placed an American flag on the wall.\nLi said they fled China last year, after he participated in a gathering over the future of a local mosque that was broken up by riot police and he feared his own arrest. He chose the U.S. because it is a free society, where his children have learned to recite from the Quran.\nHe said the migrants he encountered on his journey all left China for the U.S. to try to improve their prospects in life, and he was grateful for that opportunity. When his sons are at school, he studies for a commercial driver\u2019s license and then hopes to find a job and start paying taxes.\nYour subscription could not be saved.

        "content": "After the Senate hearing on Bell Kenz Pharma attended by DOH officials, whistleblowers, and doctor-panelists, I received lots of reactions from the medical community. &nbsp;Our Sharp Edges column on this subject has been circulating in their various chat groups of and even in lawyer-communities. &nbsp;Here is an interesting reaction from my source, who requested anonymity, a medical practitioner who watched the Senate proceedings and shared very important insights.&nbsp;\nHi, Jake. Did you ever wonder why they are zeroing in ONLY on Bell Kenz Pharma when there are SEVERAL local pharma companies owned by doctors \u2013 not only cardiologists, nephrologists, gastro etc.&nbsp; Who stands to benefit? Who is most affected by the growth of Bell Kenz. &nbsp;Is Bell Kenz the only company that gives incentives to MDs? What about some local companies giving junket trips? There are even local companies that give cash and dollars for raffles during parties.&nbsp;&nbsp;\nDr. Tony Leachon who has been with Pfizer for 15 years \u2013 did he not prescribe only Pfizer products back then? As Medical Director \u2013 did he not allow or tolerate the lavish trips of Pfizer prescribers and speakers?&nbsp; He tarnished the image of the whole medical community and is trying burn the forest.&nbsp; If he has proofs and is truly sincere to correct misdoings if there are any \u2013 why not file a formal complaint at DOH, PRC and PMA \u2013 why via social media and why intentionally tag the senate and ask for a senate hearing (wasting taxpayers\u2019 money).&nbsp; If he has proofs \u2013 why did he not submit them to the proper agencies instead of posting them in social media?&nbsp;&nbsp;\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nFrom what I have read from different Group chat platform of MDs \u2013 on the part of the senators \u2013 this is an opportunity for them to push the UHC (Universal Health Care) \u2013 and which company has generic arm and signed a contract with the government for UHC?&nbsp; The hearing is merely a zarzuela in attempt to humiliate MDs and push their agenda.&nbsp; In aid of legislation or in aid of another Pharma? Hope I am wrong.&nbsp;\nFEATURED STORIES\nOPINION\nRoque arrest serves ends of justice\nOPINION\nWe must be the answers\nOPINION\nIs our ICC case dependent on insider witnesses?\nSeveral times I heard Sen Tulfo calling Dr Go \u2013 as Mr. Go, seemingly stripping him of his title.&nbsp; He gave Dr. Go a vague and complex question and wanted a simple yes or No answer with no option to expound \u2013 then threatens him to be detained for lying?&nbsp;\nLuxury cars \u2013 So, Doctors who have practiced for decades are not entitled to somehow enjoy the fruits of their hard works, but politicians can have all the luxury cars they want \u2013 and not just one but several.&nbsp;\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nWhy is there instant presumption of irregularity \u2013 thinking doctors are not professionals and people of integrity, forgetting their sacrifice just a few years back after the pandemic? How fair is it to presume that once doctors go into business to secure the future of their family, and are now labelled as if they will simply throw away their 18 years of studying, training, and sleepless nights just like that?\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nSo, are doctors now prohibited in business related to their field otherwise it is automatically construed as conflict of interest?&nbsp; How about hospitals owned by doctors, diagnostic centers, dialysis, rehab &amp; stone treatment centers owned by MDs &amp; free standing in lying clinics?&nbsp; Doctors will have no right to have a business, but Engineers and contractors can own hardware companies, Architects &amp; designers can own a furniture shop, Vet meds can own a pet shop and Dermatologists with their own beauty center &amp; secret beauty product formulas exclusive in their center. Even priests have pay parking business and lease rental in their Churches as well as sell religious items.&nbsp;\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nDid they even pause and think why some doctors invest in some medically related business to augment their income? Maybe because they also have a family to feed and they do not want to suffer the fate of their mentors and pillars who when they got old and sick, needed to solicit donations from colleagues and sell off their assets.&nbsp; Is it wrong to diversify in a business related to one\u2019s craft as this is the field one is knowledgeable of?\nThe relationship between healthcare products and services (Pharma, Hospitals, Dialysis Centers, Drugstores, etc.) with Health care pharmaceuticals are quite complex. If Doctors are setting up hospital to fill up an unmet need in the community, is this wrong? If the hospital can cut cost of care (compared to other hospitals) is it wrong for doctors to put one up?&nbsp;\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nIf there is conflict of interest the remedy is disclosure. The problem is that there are no guidelines on how MDS should disclose their financial relations to Pharma or device companies, hospitals, healthcare centers (dialysis, Rehab center, eye surgery centers etc.). PMA should come out with a guideline and DOH, PRC etc. should follow.&nbsp;\nWhy did Sen Tulfo have to post the names of doctors \u201cpresumed\u201d to be investors \u2013 which was refuted by Dr Go- for all you know they are merely prescribers of Bell Kenz drugs? &nbsp;&nbsp;So, they want to tarnish the names of those MDs in their respective hospitals and in the community as a whole? Now these MDs will be subjected to doubts because of unfounded accusations.&nbsp;&nbsp;\nA few days before the hearing when you are in the list of pharma, you are considered big time because you are in the radar of Pharma companies. This means you have a heavy patient load and in demand, hence you are being given perks like sponsorships.&nbsp; Now because of the \u201cGood Senators\u201d, it is now viewed as an infamous list?\nDisclosure: &nbsp;I also prescribe Bell Kenz products (and support other pharma companies too) as they are cost effective and safe based on experience and prescribe it even to my mother and other family members. &nbsp;Now that they are tarnishing the company\u2019s name and fear of being labelled unethical \u2013 should I change the maintenance meds of my patients even if my patients are doing well with them.&nbsp; The company also supports CME (Continuing medical education) activities for our trainees).&nbsp; During the pandemic \u2013 Bell kens was the only pharma that was visible to doctors \u2013 delivering pandemic kits and even groceries to the frontliners at the height of the lockdown \u2013 is that an unethical practice?&nbsp; They assisted MDs find a source for molnupiravir and remdesivir for their critical patients \u2013 is that a crime?\nYour subscription could not be saved.

        "content": "On the 28th of this month, we commemorate a historic milestone in the US-Philippines bilateral relationship\u2014the 10th anniversary of the US-Philippines Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (Edca). A decade ago, President Barack Obama and President Benigno S. Aquino III convened at the historic Malaca\u00f1an in Manila to sign this pivotal agreement.\nAt a joint press conference, Obama declared, \u201cWe\u2019re beginning an important new chapter,\u201d expressing his optimism about the future of the US-Philippines alliance. His words resonated with a shared sense of purpose and commitment. Together, we pledged to bolster the Philippines\u2019 defense capabilities and collaborate with other nations to uphold stability in the Indo-Pacific, particularly in the South China Sea (SCS).As the ranking member of the Indo-Pacific subcommittee in the US House of Representatives, and having worked alongside Obama, I reflect on the past decade with great pride in the achievements of our two countries\u2019 partnership.\nIn 2014, the US and Philippine governments took a decisive step by signing Edca\u2014a significant moment, especially considering the 32-year hiatus since the US military\u2019s withdrawal from Clark Air Base and Subic Bay Naval Base in the Philippines. Edca breathed new life into our defense partnership, enabling the rotational presence of US military forces, aircraft, and ships at agreed locations within the Philippines.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nUndoubtedly, the past decade has not been without challenges. However, resilience and determination have prevailed over any doubts about the growing US-Philippines military cooperation, and today, we find ourselves on a trajectory of progress.\nFEATURED STORIES\nOPINION\nRoque arrest serves ends of justice\nOPINION\nWe must be the answers\nOPINION\nIs our ICC case dependent on insider witnesses?\nSince the signing of the Edca in 2014, the US Department of Defense has allocated approximately P6.17 billion (equivalent to $109 million) for infrastructure projects at Edca sites. This includes over $59 million for airfield improvements at Basa Air Base to serve as a logistics hub for humanitarian assistance, disaster relief, and other crisis responses. Additionally, President Joe Biden\u2019s Budget Request for Fiscal Year 2025 includes an additional $128 million for infrastructure projects. These strategic investments are expected to create more jobs and foster the growth of local businesses.\nThere is no more urgent moment to reinforce the bonds between our nations. Tensions are escalating in the SCS, with the People\u2019s Republic of China intensifying its interference with Philippine supply and fishing vessels, including dangerous maneuvers and the shooting of lasers and water cannons. Beijing\u2019s flagrant disregard for international rules, even those it has long benefited from, is evident in its unlawful maritime claims across the West Philippine Sea and the broader SCS. These actions directly threaten the sovereignty of the Philippines as a nation and the prosperity of its people.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nDuring a White House summit on April 11, attended by Presidents Biden and Marcos, Biden reaffirmed that \u201cany attack on Philippine aircraft, vessels, or armed forces in the South China Sea will invoke our Mutual Defense Treaty.\u201d This declaration reinforces the special relationship between the US and the Philippines.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nPowered By\n10 Sec\nSignal no. 4 up in Batanes due to Super Typhoon Leon | INQToday\nNext\nStay\nThe Philippines holds a special place in the heart of the US as an ally for over seven decades. Today, more than four million Filipino-Americans call the US their home, underscoring the deep cultural and economic ties between our nations. Individuals like Caterina Fake, the cofounder of Flickr, have made significant impacts in the tech world, while Bruno Mars, the Grammy-winning singer-songwriter, and Saweetie, the rapper and singer from my own hometown of Sacramento, have captivated fans worldwide with their chart-topping hits.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nIn the California district I represent, there\u2019s a vibrant Filipino-American community that enriches our local culture with its traditions and warmth. Filipino culture isn\u2019t merely accepted, but embraced and celebrated in the US. And yes, I share in the joy of savoring Filipino delicacies\u2014lumpia and halo-halo\u2014they\u2019re simply irresistible! The Philippines, with its rich heritage and humanity, has left an indelible mark on our collective consciousness.\n\u201cBayanihan\u201d a quintessential Filipino trait, embodies the spirit of community\u2014helping one\u2019s neighbor to lighten their burden, working together toward a common and noble purpose. As Biden reiterated, the US\u2019 defense commitments to the Philippines are \u201cironclad.\u201d In the spirit of bayanihan, it is time for us to work together to build an Indo-Pacific that is free, open, prosperous, and secure for all.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nRep.

        "date": "2024-04-16",
        "content": "For over 13 centuries, a sophisticated maritime kingdom flourished in the southeastern Philippine archipelago. Centered in Butuan (Caraga region), this kingdom, the \u201cKalaga-Putuan Crescent\u201d (KPC), formed a vital maritime trade triangle with the Srivijaya in Palembang (now Indonesia) and Vijaya in Champa (now Vietnam).\nThis remarkable history is revealed by Baldomero M. Olivera et al. (2024) in their study, \u201cReconstructing Philippine history before 1521: the Kalaga Putuan Crescent and the Austronesian maritime trade network\u201d (SciEnggJ, Vol. 17:01, pp. 71-85). Their research draws upon various forms of evidence: Chinese ceramics dating back to the Six Dynasties period, historical textual records, genetic evidence, and cultural artifacts that demonstrate KPC\u2019s advanced maritime expertise, enabling sustained trade and cultural exchange across the South China Sea and into the Indian Ocean.\nTraces of a vanished culture.\nMost Filipinos first encounter this lost kingdom through the writings of Antonio Pigafetta, who chronicled Ferdinand Magellan\u2019s explorations. Pigafetta\u2019s diaries describe a lavish feast hosted by the King of Mazaua, served on precious porcelain. He also recounts his encounter with the \u201cKing of Butuan and Caraga,\u201d a figure of impressive wealth and refinement. Pigafetta\u2019s detailed observations provide vivid evidence of a once-thriving, cosmopolitan culture.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nOne intriguing point is that Magellan\u2019s slave, Enrique, could converse with the King of Mazaua. This suggests a shared Austronesian trade language used across maritime centers of the time.\nFEATURED STORIES\nOPINION\nRoque arrest serves ends of justice\nOPINION\nWe must be the answers\nOPINION\nIs our ICC case dependent on insider witnesses?\nThe Kalaga-Putuan Crescent: A trade hub.\nThe KPC takes its name from its crescent shape encompassing key locations in Bicol, Eastern Visayas, Northern and Southern Mindanao. The main points being what is now Gubat, Catarman, Oras, Abuyog, San Francisco/Placer, Tandag, Butuan/Nasipit, Hinatuan, Loreto, Tagaloan, and Baroy.\nWithin this area, significant archeological finds point to KPC\u2019s importance. Sites such as the Balangay and Ivory Seal Sites, the Esperanza Vajralasa Site, and the Magroyong Gold Site have yielded a vast collection of gold objects and Chinese ceramics dating from the third to eighth centuries. This assemblage of early Chinese ceramics is remarkably richer than similar discoveries outside of China.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nInterestingly, Tang Dynasty ceramics found in Balabac, Palawan, suggest the island may have served as a key waypoint in the maritime trade route connecting the KPC, Champa, and Srivijaya.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nNetworks of exchange.\nOlivera et al. argue that the KPC played a pivotal role within an extensive Austronesian trade network that ultimately stretched to the Mediterranean and Europe. Goods like spices (cloves, nutmeg), gold, ceramics, exotic shells, pearls, and other marine products flowed along these routes, reaching China, India, the Middle East, and beyond.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThe thriving KPC maritime trade was enabled by advanced sailing technology developed a millennia earlier in the Philippine archipelago. The discovery of balangay boats in the Butuan area, dating back to before 1140 CE, offers tangible proof of this maritime prowess. Historical records, including the official Song Documents, further confirm a formal trade link between the Chinese Empire and the Kingdom of Putuan in 1011. Chinese sources indicate that large ships carrying hundreds of passengers and vast quantities of cargo plied these routes. This reflects the scale of trade at the time.\nDNA evidence from Guam, located 2,000 kilometers away across the open ocean, confirms the remarkable seafaring capabilities of early Philippine archipelago inhabitants. This migration underscores the expertise necessary to sustain long-distance trade networks like the one centered around the KPC.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nHindu-Buddhist influences.\nThe connections between the KPC, Champa, and Srivijaya are further supported by shared interactions with the Chinese court and by treasures discovered within the crescent. The Surigao Gold Treasure and other artifacts showcase Hindu-Buddhist influences prevalent across the three kingdoms.\nA window into the past and a hunger for significance.\nThe lost kingdom of the Kalaga-Putuan Crescent offers a captivating glimpse into the Philippines\u2019 rich prehistory, a story that extends back at least 40,000 years. Olivera et al. remind us that the KPC\u2019s flourishing trade networks existed within a broader context of human migration and cultural exchange across Southeast Asia. It\u2019s important to acknowledge, however, that the Philippine academic community continues to engage in vigorous debates about the sources, nature, and timing of these migrations, with various theories vying to explain the archipelago\u2019s prehistory.\nThis hunger for understanding our past isn\u2019t merely academic. By piecing together the rise and fall of past empires and political entities like the KPC, we may glean valuable insights for navigating similar challenges in our own time. The very seas that once facilitated trade and cultural exchange, like the South China Sea, are now potential flashpoints for future conflicts. Understanding the interconnectedness of the past can inform our approach to fostering cooperation and ensuring a more peaceful future in this vital region.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\nYour subscription could not be saved.

        "content": "(First of two parts)\nIn continuation of my article last Jan. 15 and Feb. 26, the 28 strategic objectives that will help make Dream Philippines 2046 happen are enumerated here, together with some suggestions on how each Filipino can contribute.\n1. A virtues-based society\nIt is in the family that values are formed. If Filipino parents make conscious efforts to form the values (such as truth, justice, patriotism, integrity and honesty, and responsible citizenship) of their children, we have a good chance at Dream Philippines 2046.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\n2. Deep spiritual, ethical, and moral foundation\nThe school and the church are where the values formed at home are strengthened and reinforced. Values, like ethical behavior, fairness, accountability, transparency, and servant-leadership, can be learned.\nFEATURED STORIES\nBUSINESS\nBIZ BUZZ: Surprise! MVP revives Smart Money\nBUSINESS\nTrump is Time's Person of the Year, rings NYSE's opening bell\nBUSINESS\nFilipinos urged to go digital in giving Christmas cash gifts\n3. Human rights, religious freedom, and the spirit of enterprise\nFilipinos can stand on the sidelines looking at the parade go by. Or they can help build Dream Philippines by being vigilant watchdogs and warriors in promoting and defending human rights and the dignity of the human person, freedom of worship, freedom of speech, and the spirit of enterprise whether in government, business, or civil society. This also includes the fight against corruption and mis/mal/disinformation.\n4. Deep sense of patriotism\nThe Filipino should have a strong sense of love of country, civic duty, and concern for the common good driven by a genuine pride of the Philippine history and heritage.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\n5. Strong family institution /quality of life\nStrengthening the family will require providing for the integral development of all its members \u2014 from maternal health to infant nutrition, education, meaningful employment, and social security.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\n6. Preservation of rich cultural heritage\nOne way an ordinary Filipino can help in promoting and preserving our rich cultural heritage is by being a patron of Philippine arts and culture, supporting productions in the visual and performing arts, and taking care of our rich tourism resources with world-class, personalized, and hospitable tourism personnel.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\n7. Strengthened, integrated and harmonized political systems\nThe challenge to Filipino governors (government leaders) is how to build ethical, strong, professionalized, and accountable institutions in their respective spheres of influence (government agencies, local government units, Senate, Congress) with the use of good governance principles and practices.\nThe governed also have a role to play in making sure that the political institutions become strong by being vigilant about national and local issues, by contributing actively in national dialogues and fora that affect the political institutions, and by influencing their own organizations to raise national issues, especially those that threaten the integrity and strength of political institutions.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\n8. Mature electoral process and civic consciousness\nThe governed can do their share by exercising their right to vote, voting wisely and making sure that the vote is counted. They should vote for leaders who are honest, not corrupt, service-oriented, and with a strong sense of country and community. The Filipino governor (whether in the executive, legislative and judicial branches of government) can ensure the achievement of Dream Philippines 2046 with principles-based governance, servant leadership, competence, dedication, and a strong sense of country. The governors must ensure that the electoral process is kept credible, honest and transparent with the use of appropriate and up-to-date technology, systems, and processes.\n9. Stable national peace and security\nWhile this is primarily the role and accountability of the government, Filipino citizens can help ensure peace and security in the areas where they live, work, play, study by participating actively in the governance of their communities \u2014 whether homeowners associations, barangays, towns and cities and provinces.\nThe uniformed services (military, police) can help ensure national peace and security by being faithful to their transformation road maps using the Performance Governance System that they have put in place for some time now.\n10. Universal health care\nAgain, this is primarily a government accountability and responsibility but Filipinos can help achieve this objective by being and staying healthy with regular exercise, proper nutrition, and avoidance of toxic substances beyond moderate levels (e.g., alcohol). Healthy Filipinos will not strain government resources allotted for healthcare.\n11. Continuing education for all\nAll Filipinos must aspire for continuing education for life. But it starts with each family ensuring that the children, especially the younger ones, are properly nourished to avoid malnutrition, stunting, and wasting. Education is the great equalizer, so all parents must strive to send their children to school long enough to learn skills, knowledge, and habits for a productive life.\n12. Peaceful, safe and secure communities\nA long-time dream is for the government to transform the security and safety services sector (military, police, fire, penal, and the corresponding local government public safety units) into agencies that are respected, trusted, and loved by the people who feel safe and secure. The Filipinos can contribute by actively supporting these agencies as civilian partners and as the primary source of stakeholders\u2019 feedback as to how they are performing. Indifference can only lead to unsafe, unsecured and unpeaceful communities.\n13. Promotion of STEM and dual vocational training with strong values components\nCrucial to this strategic objective is the quality of the teachers. There is a need to select, prepare, train and retrain, develop and retain teachers in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) and communications as well as who can teach civics, good manners and right conduct and values formation. Parents must constantly monitor the progress of their children in school, inculcate good study habits, model and reinforce the values that the schools teach and help the children decide on a career to pursue.\nThere is nothing more tragic than a student in a farming town being sent to college to take up courses that have no \u201cpractical\u201d applications to their lives. After graduation, if one cannot find a job in the city, he or she invariably returns to the town to be a farmer, an untrained, incompetent farmer. With a good dual training program, instead of pursuing a college degree that does not assure employment, the student is trained as a world-class farmer who is sorely needed in the hometown. The country wins; the farming community wins; the family wins and the student wins.\n14. Protection, conservation and judicious development of marine resources\nWhile the government is primarily responsible for developing and implementing policies covering maritime spaces and resources in a sustainable manner, the citizens can contribute by being vigilant against destructive fishing (e.g., dynamites). They must respect and protect sanctuaries, diversity resources and engage in entrepreneurial fisheries ventures with the use of modern aquatic technologies (like fish cages) and more efficient distribution channels.\n15. Responsible development of mountain and mineral resources\nThe responsibility to ensure the sustainable development of mountain and mineral resources belongs primarily to the government. The citizens can get involved by organizing and monitoring the compliance of mining and extractive industry companies to regulatory standards of sustainability and responsible mining. The citizen group that can best do this would be the corps of executives, managers, supervisors, and workers in the industry.\n(To be concluded)\nYour subscription could not be saved.

When she finally coaxes the weight over her head and stands upright, despite her quivering and how low she had to lunge, the crowd erupts in cheers while Diaz\u2019s own face splits into a euphoric mix of disbelief and triumph.\nAs she stands tall with 127 kg over her head with a grace and strength that is almost otherworldly, the host proudly declares, \u201cPhilippines, the wait is over! The gold is yours!\u201d\nHidilyn Diaz\u2019s triumph became a prayer for everyone in the Philippines, but it resonated especially with women and female athletes who felt and continue to feel that the sports world is one in which they aren\u2019t always included\nDiaz, in a moment that will be remembered by the Philippine consciousness forever, drops the weight and shrieks with joy. Her coaches run over to embrace her as she staggers backward in elation, covering her face as she cries, the literal weight of all her hard work and sacrifice coming to a beautiful, critical point.\nIn a red room with the Olympics logo emblazoned behind her, she sticks out, defiant and proud in bright blue with \u201cPhilippines\u201d printed across her chest as she tearfully thanks her coaches around her and the camera, chalk still streaked on her palms. Later, she sings the national anthem, beaming as she stands tall on the highest tier of the medalist platform.\nAll over the Philippines, social media erupts. Videos of\nHidilyn Diaz\u2019s win\nare posted everywhere, with fellow Filipinas in particular triumphantly sharing the moment she became a gold medalist and, later on, how she became a huge beacon for women around the country trying to chase their own athletic dreams.\nHer name and triumph became a prayer for everyone in the Philippines, but it resonated especially with women and female athletes who, for a very long time, felt and continue to feel that the sports world is one in which they aren\u2019t always included.\nFilipino athletes carrying the torch\nWhether in its roots in Ancient Greece\u2019s Olympic games or the pervasive\ngender pay gap\nin the contemporary sports world, women have often been overlooked, left out of conversations, or even simply barred entry altogether. This is not surprising, given that we have had a historic uphill battle to be included in most anything\u2014especially something as male-dominated as the sports world.\nWhile we now enjoy our women\u2019s divisions for sports and female-oriented sports in general, it\u2019s still hard to say that equity is all there\nWhile we now enjoy our women\u2019s divisions for sports and female-oriented sports in general, it\u2019s still hard to say that equity is all there, especially in a Philippines that is still so embroiled in its own\nmachismo\nand its long history of gender insensitivity. We\u2019ve come a long way, yes, but there is still a lot of work to be done in a sports world still largely saturated by and often designed for men.\nIt\u2019s plain to see when sold-out stadiums for men\u2019s basketball championships at the collegiate level are televised with sponsors and commercials, while many women-led sports usually only have the team\u2019s friends and family at the sidelines, shelling out their own money for transportation and equipment (with a few exceptions).\nFrancesca Altomonte, national athlete for softball, asserts, \u201cThe sports world\u2014it\u2019s ruled by older men.\u201d\nNational athlete for softball Francesca Altomonte | Photo by Ezio Ratti\nCam Rodriguez, player for the\nPhilippine Women\u2019s National Football Team\nwho qualified for the FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup, agrees as she recalls attempts to get funding. \u201cWe needed to wrestle with leaders to give us sufficient financial support and priority for field availability prior to official international tournaments. We were expected to win, but we were given limited resources to help us do so. It felt as though we needed to prove that we deserved support before being given support.\u201d\nJamaica Jornacion, champion pole athlete and founder of pole and aerial studio Beast House, also echoes this sentiment\u2014especially as an athlete from a sport that isn\u2019t often even recognized as a sport here in the Philippines, or is considered \u201ctaboo.\u201d\nCam Rodriguez\n\u201cWith pole, there was no support from the government, but I\u2019m very lucky because I had support from my students and my family. Compared to other sports, like basketball or any other dance style, pole is still so far away from even being seen as a sport here, even if we win abroad,\u201d she says.\nJornacion recounts winning gold and being recognized\u2014but only after the fact. \u201cIt\u2019s good, but you need more than a trophy to reach your dreams,\u201d she says as she points out that all those competitions were self-financed.\n\u201cCompared to other sports, like basketball or any other dance style, pole is still so far away from even being seen as a sport here, even if we win abroad,\u201d Jamaica Jornacion says\nAstrid Borje, an international aerial hoop and trapeze champion and instructor at Beast House, agrees.\n\u201cThe first time I tried joining a competition, everyone from Taiwan and Thailand who joined was sponsored by their governments. Kami lang hindi. Doon ko nakita na parang we always get recognized outside of the country, yet we never get funding or help\u2014it\u2019s all us. Pera ko \u2018yun,\u201d she narrates.\nJamaica Jornacion\nEven if we fly banners welcoming FIlipina athletes home from their competitions abroad, they are often the ones tasked with the additional burden of finding the funding to get there in the first place. As competent athletes, they should be given the support they need throughout the process, and not just when they prove they\u2019re worth it\u2014as if a medal can supplement the financial burden to represent a country that doesn\u2019t even see them until after the glory.\nSuperficiality sidelines female athletes\nWhen the conversations about women\u2019s sports predictably turn to looks and beauty instead of the power, grit, and discipline it takes to be an athlete, it\u2019s almost a given. Most, if not all, female athletes have experienced being scrutinized by men in the sports world and judged as to whether or not they fit the mold that this world imposes on women.\nAstrid Borje\nFemale athletes almost always face being picked apart for their looks and objectified. Instead of the conversations revolving around their\nprowess\n, it often morphs into what they\u2019re wearing, how they look, if they\u2019re presentable, if they\u2019re feminine, and if they still appeal to the\nmale gaze\n. They\u2019re policed to look, dress, or appear a certain way\u2014even athletes.\nSabina Yulo, powerlifter and founder of body acceptance community Hi Smithy!, comments, saying, \u201cThere\u2019s a common misconception, especially in the Philippines, that women shouldn\u2019t lift because they should be&nbsp; \u2018feminine\u2019 and\nlifting might make their muscles big\n. When I started lifting, I had family tell me to be careful because I might get bigger or \u2018look like a man,\u2019 as if women shouldn\u2019t show physical strength or take up too much physical space. But women don\u2019t exist in this life to look pretty and be dainty. We can be strong instead, or we can be strong as well.\u201d\n\u201cWhen you\u2019ve been conditioned to think that your beauty is all you have to offer, it\u2019s difficult to unlearn,\u201d says Sabina Yulo\nShe adds, \u201cWhen you\u2019ve been conditioned to think that your beauty is all you have to offer, it\u2019s difficult to unlearn.\u201d\nBecause of this pressure to always look pretty and to focus on appearance, some female athletes still take extreme precautions just to avoid looking unpresentable. Altomonte weighs in on the pressure to stay fair-skinned even in sports that had girls playing under the sun:\n\u201cBack then, if the uniform had shorts, they\u2019d be wearing leggings underneath and long sleeves under jerseys. Nowadays, I see long sleeves and long socks, face covers, caps, shades, and a handkerchief around their faces just to cover their face so they don\u2019t get dark from the sun,\u201d she says, though acknowledges that there has been a bit more acceptance in recent years.\nSabina Yulo\nWhen a sport is more dominated by women, like dance or aerial arts, the conversation shifts to being strictly about aesthetics instead of the inherent strength and difficulty it takes to look that graceful. These women are subjected to hundreds of anonymous comments devaluing and stripping them of their personhood, what makes them powerful, and even the challenge of what they\u2019re doing. Comments focused solely on how hot they are dominate any conversation. Instead of discussing technique and discipline, as many would with male-led sports, they turn it into a beauty competition.\nInstagram famously even faced backlash for shadowbanning many pole dancers, limiting their reach. Instagram said these posts, no matter what, were deemed \u201cinappropriate\u201d according to their community guidelines, which many aerial artists and pole dancers protested.\nWhen a sport is more dominated by women, like dance or aerial arts, the conversation shifts to being strictly about aesthetics instead of the inherent strength and difficulty it takes to look that graceful\nBorje adds to this, saying, \u201cThe people who are doing this are strong women,\nstrong men\n. We come from different professions\u2014lawyers, doctors, all kinds of jobs. And yet you think of us as lowly, mababa ang tingin, or as \u2018just\u2019 strippers. And even then, if that were true, there\u2019s nothing even wrong with being a stripper.\u201d\nWomen-led sports, like certain dance styles, aerial arts, and pole dancing, are often looked down on or have a stigma still attached by virtue of their history, despite how contemporary athletes have reclaimed something that used to subjugate women and turned it into a full-fledged sport.\nFrancesca Altomonte celebrating with the team during their match against Italy at the XVII Women Softball World Cup Group C | Photo by Ezio Ratti\nJornacion continues by acknowledging pole dancing\u2019s origins and how a lot of people still try to hide it. \u201cPole dancing is evolving. It\u2019s an art. Sometimes, when I do interviews, they try to edit the history when I talk about it, which is that it came from strippers\u2014and that\u2019s the truth. How we climb, the shoes we wear, everything came from the strippers. It\u2019s an important highlight for me to acknowledge that.\u201d She nods as she acknowledges the women who made the first forays into the art form she loves today.\nJornacion adds that, with pole, there\u2019s an extra emphasis on objectification and artistry being devalued because of the sport\u2019s origins.\nCam Rodriguez is glad to be recognized for her hard work after she and her team qualified for the FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup in 2022\n\u201cI\u2019m at the stage where I feel free to produce something, to create something. I\u2019m equipped. But then I feel cornered. No matter the outcome, even if the standard is really high, some people will still refuse to accept it. Sometimes it\u2019s because I, the producer, am a woman, and the artist is referred to as \u2018just a woman.\u2019 A big factor is that pole dancing is involved, and it\u2019s still not fully accepted, no matter the technique or difficulty. Sometimes I feel like the Philippines still isn\u2019t ready for it,\u201d she says.\nIt becomes a tiresome game of too feminine and then not feminine enough. Women are told to look a certain way but only to a \u201ctasteful\u201d degree\u2014all standards imposed externally by people who have little to no interest in recognizing these women as athletes anyway. Female athletes, despite their strengths and accolades in their chosen sport, are constantly pared down and criticized for not fitting into societal boxes.\nFemale athletes, despite their strengths and accolades in their chosen sport, are constantly pared down and criticized for not fitting into societal boxes\n\u201cMy video played while my tito in the US was at work, and his co-worker asked, \u2018Why are you watching a stripper at work?\u2019 My tito said, \u2018What are you talking about? That\u2019s my niece!\u2019 His co-worker said, \u2018Your niece is a stripper?\u2019 Sabi niya, \u2018No, she\u2019s an athlete!'\u201d Borje adds to this sentiment.\nStanding in the way of success\nMany female athletes also acknowledge that there\u2019s still a gap between the support and funding they get compared to male athletes, as well as being compared to men\u2019s teams despite having their own identities.\nJamaica Jornacion is a champion pole athlete and the founder of pole and aerial studio Beast House\n\u201cI remember people saying, \u2018May women\u2019s team pala \u2019yung football, kala ko pang lalaki lang \u2019yun.\u2019 Now, we\u2019re more known as the\nFilipinas\nand \u2018yung team na nag-World Cup,\u2019 haha!\u201d Rodriguez says with a laugh, glad to be recognized for her hard work after she and her team qualified for the FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup in 2022.\nIn a male-dominated sport like lifting, Yulo knows that comparisons with male counterparts aren\u2019t productive, as their physiology means they\u2019re capable of different things.\nBorje echoes this, saying that though she often feels frustrated with herself for taking longer to land strength-based tricks compared with men who try out the craft, she\u2019s still always thankful for her own strengths as a woman and as an individual that gives her an edge in other aspects of the sport.\nIn a male-dominated sport like lifting, Sabina Yulo knows that comparisons with male counterparts aren\u2019t productive, as their physiology means they\u2019re capable of different things\nBeyond that, many of our female athletes have also highlighted the intense pay gap that does exist for women-led sports that aren\u2019t as popular.\n\u201cPay is still definitely a challenge as a female football player. With the absence of a local professional football league and contracts as a national team athlete, we are pushed to find other means to sustain ourselves. Some of us take coaching jobs, others a corporate job,\u201d says Rodriguez.\nAstrid Borje is an international aerial hoop and trapeze champion and instructor at Beast House\nIt would be disingenuous to say that all women-led sports are undersupported\u2014but even the ones that do get a lot of support are usually because the physiques of the players align with what the patriarchal sports world demands. Volleyball, for example, is wildly popular in the Philippines and, thankfully, is very well-supported. However, it\u2019s easy to see the discrepancy compared to other sports and how physical appearance plays a part as well.\nAltomonte adds to this, saying, \u201cVolleyball thankfully does get a lot of support, but I\u2019ve been told that getting that same support for softball just isn\u2019t possible because we\u2019re not \u2018pretty\u2019 like the volleyball girls. We\u2019re not tall or slender; we\u2019re dark, all that.\u201d\nIt would be disingenuous to say that all women-led sports are undersupported\u2014but even the ones that do get a lot of support are usually because the physiques of the players align with what the patriarchal sports world demands\nShe says this while acknowledging how difficult volleyball can be, but how people still often focus on the appearance aspect still and, unfortunately, often do not reserve that same energy for other women-led sports.\nA spirited community\nFortunately, the women in these sports have also found communities, motivations, and inspirations in spite of the difficulties they\u2019ve faced.\n\u201cWhen I\u2019m around other lifters or people who appreciate the sport and don\u2019t think of sports and exercise as just methods for\nweight loss\n, I feel celebrated. Being around people who get it makes me feel validated\u2014especially in competitions; the energy is wild. It\u2019s so inspiring to see other women show and celebrate their strength and all the hard work they\u2019ve put in to lift their weights,\u201d says Yulo.\nScreencap of Sabina Yulo during a competition\n\u201cI stopped thinking about the superficial reasons for working out. I stopped doing it for the abs or the weight loss. I stopped looking at myself as a weight loss project. I stopped thinking about what people will think of me,\u201d Yulo adds when expounding on her motivation and how being surrounded by others who celebrate rather than reduce the sport has become her driving force.\n\u201cTo be in the same room as Filipina athlete greats like Akiko Thomson,\nHidilyn Diaz\n, Bong Coo during the PSC Women in Sports event has been inspiring. I\u2019m a big believer in \u2018What you can see, you can be\u2019, and seeing them be successful drives my belief that I can be too. It is my hope that with the work I do, I can help other women believe in their capability as well,\u201d says Rodriguez, knowing that hurdles, while challenging, can be overcome.\n\u201cWhen I\u2019m around other lifters or people who appreciate the sport and don\u2019t think of sports and exercise as just methods for weight loss, I feel celebrated,\u201d says Sabina Yulo\n\u201cWell, I think when playing internationally, you feel you are really equal and that you are a real athlete. In multisport events, all the athletes there know what you go through. Every athlete there is different, every physical body is different, and we see each other for the athletes that we are, even if we come in different shapes and sizes. Also, when it comes to softball as a sport in general, people don\u2019t realize that Filipinos are good! Maybe we\u2019re not at the same skill level as other international teams cause we don\u2019t have the coaches, we don\u2019t have the training, and we\u2019re not developing as quickly as others\u2014but we get things done,\u201d explains Altomonte as she acknowledges that those who get it, understand, and they\u2019re the ones whose opinions matter to her.\nBorje and Jornacion agree that their students motivate them and make them feel celebrated and part of a community.\n\u201cCompeting is one thing but teaching? And seeing your students grow every day? That\u2019s the thing\u2014hindi \u2019yun mababayaran. Seeing them progress and then thinking na, galing \u2019yan sa\u2019kin. I helped them reach that,\u201d says Borje, beaming.\n\u201cYou know what amazes me is that some or most of my students work full time, and then they\u2019ll go to the studio and train, and some of them even compete or perform. You work all day, then come to class, and you\u2019re excelling. They have so many roles in life, and they\u2019re still excelling\u2014galing,\u201d says Jornacion.\nFilipina athletes are breaking barriers\nCam Rodriguez says that pay is still a challenge as a female football player\u2014\u201dWe are pushed to find other means to sustain ourselves\u201d\nWhen it comes to where the journey of women\u2019s sports and female athletes is going, everyone was hopeful despite the hurdles they had to overcome to take their space, celebrate themselves, and continue their craft.\n\u201cI believe we made a huge statement by qualifying for the FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup in 2022, winning the AFF Women\u2019s Championship and winning a bronze medal in the Southeast Asian Games in the same year we qualified; and then winning our first game in our maiden appearance in the WC in 2023. This historic, or, her-storic journey has really shifted the narrative of women\u2019s sports and women footballers in the country. Because we were able to achieve such historic feats, people started believing that \u2018we can,'\u201d says Rodriguez, noting that she is hopeful for the future of her sport and women-led sports in general.\nThough the road has been paved with additional trials by virtue of these women being women, they all still encourage other athletes to pursue their goals if they have the means and motivation to\u2014whether it\u2019s in the sports world or not\n\u201cThere\u2019s still a long way to go\u2014but we\u2019ve come very far,\u201d says Jornacion. Borje says something similar: \u201cThere\u2019s still a lot of work to be done.\u201d\nThough the road has been paved with additional trials by virtue of these women being women, they all still encourage other athletes to pursue their goals if they have the means and motivation to\u2014whether it\u2019s in the sports world or not. This is because they believe, more than anything, that leveling the proverbial playing field and achieving true equity in sports means taking up space and continuing to excel to prove that it can be done\u2014even when the odds are not in your favor.\nThere\u2019s still a long way to go for Filipina athletes \u201cbut we\u2019ve come very far,\u201d says Jamaica Jornacion\n\u201cFind what makes you feel strong. Don\u2019t come in thinking about \u2018What will make me lose weight the fastest?\u2019 If you do things for weight loss, it won\u2019t stick. And when you stop doing things to prove things to other people, you\u2019ll find a passion that feels true to you,\u201d Yulo adds.\n\u201cBelieve that you can, put the work in, and surround yourself with good people who believe in you. There is power in building a village that will support you and challenge you for the better. The way you talk to yourself matters. The way you view yourself matters. The people we surround ourselves with help shape how we view ourselves; so choose good people.&nbsp;\n\u201cTake it one step at a time. But you have to really know your goal. What do I want to achieve? Know what you want and then work towards that. It\u2019s not going to be easy, it\u2019s not going to be instant. It\u2019s never magic,\u201d says Astrid Borje\n\u201cAnd for more practical advice, learn from the best in your field. Be brave and put yourself out there. There will always be growing to do. The presence of fear is not the absence of capability. You are capable,\u201d Rodriguez says.&nbsp;\n\u201cTake it one step at a time. But you have to really know your goal. What do I want to achieve? Know what you want and then work towards that. It\u2019s not going to be easy, it\u2019s not going to be instant. It\u2019s never magic. It may take years, but you have to take that journey to be strong. And you have to start. You can\u2019t just give an excuse like, \u2018I\u2019ll only start if mapayat na ako or mas magaan na ako or when I have upper body strength.\u2019 How will you develop that unless you start? Kelan ka magsisimula? There\u2019s nothing wrong with trying,\u201d says Borje.\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be tough, but everything else is tough anyway\u2014we\u2019re going to face that regardless\nbecause\nwe are women. But I think things can change\u2014so do it,\u201d encourages Francesca Altomonte\n\u201cAt the end of the day, you do it for yourself, not for other people. If you want to try something outside of your comfort zone, do it. Do it now. Everyone had to start; everyone was a beginner. No one was good at the beginning, so you might as well be a beginner among the experts. If it\u2019s not for you, move on. If you find it, your quality of life will be different,\u201d says Jornacion.\n\u201cDo it. It\u2019s going to be hard, but if you want change, it\u2019s gotta be done by people who are really passionate about it and who can really make a difference. It\u2019s going to be tough, but everything else is tough anyway\u2014we\u2019re going to face that regardless\nbecause\nwe are women. But I think things can change\u2014so do it,\u201d encourages Altomonte.\nDespite a sports world not designed to accommodate them, these Filipina athletes have risen through the ranks to claim victory. However, beyond gold and glory, they have cultivated a love for their craft, a discipline to excel, and a path for other women to inch toward their own finish lines with grace and grit that they have prized much more than any trophy they could and have won.\nPhotos courtesy of the subjects | Art by Ella Lambio\nFollow Preen on&nbsp;\nFacebook\n,&nbsp;\nInstagram\n,&nbsp;\nTwitter\n,&nbsp;\nTikTok\n,&nbsp;\nYouTube\n, and&nbsp;\nViber\nRead more",

In Southeast Asia, Singapore bagged the exclusive right to stage her concert series. \u2014AFP\nUsing the expanded business model framework of the Mansmith Business Model Map to decode the Singaporean concert grant, the framework provides a structured approach in analyzing and designing business models, focusing on various key building blocks and their interdependencies.\nLet\u2019s look at the first five building blocks, known as the offering model, that can make Singapore desirable with the Taylor Swift deal.\nTarget market: Foreign tourists, given the aim to make Singapore a regional cultural hub and top-of-mind tourist destination.\nValue proposition: Exclusive opportunity for Singapore being the only stop for the artist\u2019s concert in Asean.\nChannel: Offering the 55,000-seater National Stadium at Marina Bay Sands, the new prominent visual landmark in Singapore, as an exclusive venue.\nCustomer bonding strategy: Generate consumer demand by promoting Singapore through extensive media coverage and word of mouth, encouraging tourists to visit or revisit Singapore.\nRevenue model: Generate government revenue from increased taxes due to higher spending by tourists. Additional revenue could come from a percent of ticket sales, merchandise and sponsorships.\nBuilding blocks\nLet\u2019s look at the critical six building blocks of the operating model that will make the offering model of the Taylor Swift deal feasible.\nOperating model:\nValue chain: Include the Singapore Tourism Board and the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth in negotiating and facilitating the concert ahead of other countries.\nKey processes: Offer the advantage of an organized and disciplined government where permits and regulation ease can be guaranteed. Effective security measures are already in place for the safety of the artist, organizers and attendees. Offer assistance for coordinated transportation, accommodation and other logistical aspects for smooth event execution.\nKey resources: Highlight available venues, with accommodation options, transportation facilities, security measures and other logistical support required by the concert organizer.\nKey complementors: Taylor Swift as main attraction will be the tourist crowd drawer; AEG is a partner in international large-scale event organizing.\nReconfiguration for innovation: (Start doing) Create an exclusive international event to enhance the cultural reputation of Singapore to attract foreign tourists. (Stop doing): Move away from traditional tax revenue model.\nCost: Offer grant for concert to secure exclusivity in hosting the event, based on earlier data provided in cities where concerts had been hosted. The benefit from economic and cultural stimulation will be more than the grant amount since tourists will spend money on hotels, food and souvenirs.\nBased on the Mansmith business model map of Taylor Swift\u2019s Singapore concert, it was an innovative offer made by Singapore that can benefit them in at least four ways\u2014tourism, cultural image, economic boost and higher tax revenue.\nIf the Philippines or any Southeast Asia were to host a pop icon like Taylor Swift in the future, should it offer a similar grant without asking for exclusivity? Should it first consult its competing neighboring countries in the name of inclusivity? Why or why not? What do you think? \u2014\nCONTRIBUTED INQ\nJosiah Go is chair and chief innovation strategist of Mansmith and Fielders Inc.

In 1763.\nHistorians say she was 32 years old when she commanded rebel forces to free their beloved Ilocos from its Spanish overlords after the assassination of her second husband Diego Silang, leader of Ilocos fight for independence.&nbsp; She was later captured and executed, and to this day inspires Filipinas to stand up to injustice.\nAbout a century later the Filipina brand of courage and love of country came to fore anew in Gregoria de Jesus, Agueda Kahabagan, Teresa Magbanua, Melchora Aquino, Trinidad Tecson and the many unsung Filipinas who contributed in various ways to the Philippine\nRevolution\nagainst Spain.\nDe Jesus founded the women\u2019s chapter of the\nKatipunan\n, led by its \u201cSupremo,\u201d her first husband Andres\nBonifacio\n. &nbsp;The revolutionary organization kindled the bravery of Kahabagan,&nbsp;a general in Laguna, and Magbanua in the Visayas, and Aquino, who tended to injured revolutionaries in Manila even at her advanced age. &nbsp;Tecson went on to establish the Philippine Red Cross.\nYour subscription could not be saved.

On the surface a fashion show typically headlined by a PH-based designer, each event also showcases art and food products crafted locally and beyond.\nYuchengco is no less known for supporting journalism, having published \u201cFilipinas,\u201d the first Fil-Am glossy magazine \u201cfor all Filipinos\u201d to feature creative writing. &nbsp;Ever au courant, she ventured into digital publishing with \u201cPositively Filipino\u201d comprising the Filipinas core team after she sold the publication to advertising ace Greg Macabenta.\nADVERTISEMENT\nTo some, her most important gift to the community is her willingness to share. &nbsp;Two years ago, she offered to be the fiscal sponsor of another woman-led nonprofit focused on her favorite cause \u2013 education, this time to combat family and intimate partner abuse.\n\u201cWe have had some victories but we have had setbacks too,\u201d she assessed the status of US women with\nInquirer.net USA.\n\u201cIn general, women still lag behind men in terms of pay, rights and benefits, social standing and representation. We still have quite a way to go to achieve equality, to end racism and discrimination in all forms, and we need to support each other so that our voices can be heard in the halls of power and decision-making.\u201d\nShe echoes the words of the country\u2019s first Black, first Asian and first woman Vice President Kamala Harris: \u201cthe status of women is the status of democracy\u201d as the ability of women to participate safely, freely and equally in political life and in society is \u201ca defining feature of democracy.\u201d\nProgressively active\nHer married name rings a bell in legal and political circles everywhere, but the former Cynthia Arnaldo is her own woman, who set out to do good by earning a master\u2019s degree in religious education and coming to America to confront oppression.\n\u201cAte Cyn,\u201d as Cynthia Bonta is called by intimates and mentees, currently sits on the board of the Central Valley Empowerment Alliance (CVEA), described by executive director Mari Perez-Ruiz as a \u201cmulti-ethnic\u2026grassroots\u201d community development nonprofit to \u201cempower through transformative change\u201d in the state\u2019s deep rural communities and urban centers of Fresno, Madera, Visalia and Bakersfield.\nThree years ago, CVEA opened the doors of the Larry Itliong Resource Center in Poplar, Tulare County, to celebrate the birthday of Fil-Am labor organizer and California Hall of Fame inductee Larry Itliong and honor the stakeholders of the farm worker movement that unionized the community.\nIn the middle of that movement and the five-year farm worker\u2019s strike was Cynthia Bonta and then-husband fellow missionary Warren Bonta.\n\u201cAte Cyn,\u201d as Cynthia Bonta (in photo with granddaughter Reina Bonta) is called by intimates and mentees, currently sits on the board of the Central Valley Empowerment Alliance. CONTRIBUTED\nCynthia Bonta attributes the victory of the movement to inclusion and collaboration, with indigenous and Yemeni workers locking arms with Filipino and Mexican workers.\nHer activism begins at home where she raised her children the best way she knows how: \u201cto be a contributing member of society by being a protector, a teacher, an enabler, a guide an example,\u201d she says.&nbsp; Her children Lisa Ligaya Bonta Sumii, a psychotherapist; Jonathan, a diversity and environment expert, and Rob, California\u2019s Attorney General, prove the efficacy of her lessons.&nbsp; These days her grandchildren are the beneficiaries of her guidance.&nbsp; Her granddaughter Reina, eldest of Rob\u2019s three children, produced and directed \u201cLAHI,\u201d a short film dedicated to Cynthia and the impact of the Filipino diaspora on its multigenerational relationships.\nBonta left the Philippines but kept the land of her birth in her heart by organizing the Philippine Independence Day and Filipino American History Month festivities in Alameda, California.\nRecently she called together current and former elected officials to press on with the progressive agenda.&nbsp; Her appeal resonates this election year:\n\u201cAll of us are threatened to lose our freedoms and our rights as human beings as authoritarianism, fascism rises up in the world,\u201d she warned.&nbsp; \u201cWomen are being targeted and I dare say is a threat to patriarchy because our latent power when released is as a swollen river that breaks the dam of sexism and objectification. We are showing our power in movements internationally!\u201d\nShe aired regret that women are \u201cstill relegated to staying home\u201d at domestic chores\u201d as she does \u201cnot sense a breakthrough in the power systems run by men to treat women equally.\u201d&nbsp; Yet she expressed hope in the \u201cwomen\u2019s movement gaining more and more political power to bring about transformative change in our society to live together in mutual respect, understanding and cooperation.\u201d\nChanging face\nBecause of Marily Mondejar, the world\u2019s perception of the Filipina has changed.\nNo longer the \u201cmail-order brides, sluts, exotic, sexy and submissive wives\u201d that popped up on internet searches and appalled her almost three decades ago, the Filipina is viewed as a power player and decision-maker, leader and problem-solver.&nbsp; Like Mondejar herself.\nShe witnessed from her first involvement in a 1998 political campaign the conspicuous absence of Filipino Americans where it matters, if they are to gain empowerment. She learned about strategy and the need to organize, build a support network \u2013 a sisterhood \u2013 and decided to make it happen.\nShe crafted a plan and in 2001 launched the Filipina Women\u2019s Network as a nonprofit professional organization.\nMarily Mondejar launched the Filipina Women\u2019s Network in 2001. CONTRIBUTED\nIn 2003 Mondejar made friends with Eve Ensler, creator of \u201cThe Vagina Monologues,\u201d and proceeded to stage the collective testimonies of women\u2019s sexual awakenings that helped them understand and overcome their low self-esteem borne of patriarchy.&nbsp; Each production united Filipinas who shared their own stories including those of intimate partner violence, eventually shedding shame and self-blame after learning its dynamics.&nbsp; Proceeds from the presentations were donated to domestic violence agencies in the area.\nThe tight sisterhood led Mondejar to establish Foundation for Filipina Women\u2019s Network as the organization for the Most Influential Filipina Women Awardees. \u201cThey are leaders in the public and private sectors from 34 countries selected yearly from a worldwide search for Filipina women with a track record of accomplishments with a lasting global imprint through their work in their professional fields, industry sectors and local communities,\u201d she said.\nHer organization, the Foundation for the Filipina Women\u2019s Network \u201cprovides leadership and opportunities for Filipina women to achieve professional competence and personal fulfillment. FFWN supports the conditions for success for Filipina women.\u201d\nFWN\u2019s vision is to be a \u201cresource for leadership, personal and professional development for Filipina women worldwide,\u201d which is today, and more.&nbsp; As is the work.\n\u201cProgress for women in the US is slow.,\u201d Mondejar told\nInquirer.netUSA\n. \u201cAfter #MeToo, overturning Roe v Wade and electing a woman US Vice President we are becoming more visible and heard by the media. (But) We need to do more \u2013 women\u2019s organizations are now forming coalitions but we need to stay vigilant. Emerge America is doing a great job with encouraging women to run for office.\u201d\nShe cited \u201ctwo major wins in Super Tuesday\u201d and predicted that the two \u201cFilipina women top vote getters will crush the November elections \u2013 &nbsp;Jessica Caloza for California State Assembly D52 and Nikki Fortunato Bas for Alameda County Board of Supervisors after terming out as president of the Oakland City Council.\u201d\nREAD MORE\nWant stories like this delivered straight to your inbox?\nStay informed.

By mobilizing our local entrepreneurs and fostering community\n&nbsp;\nengagement, we are taking significant strides towards a greener and more sustainable Bacolod,\u201d he\n&nbsp;\nsaid.\n&nbsp;\n\u201cAs we launch the Tindahan Extra Mile Program, we are not merely initiating a program; we\n&nbsp;\nare igniting a movement,\u201d Mayor Albee emphasized. \u201cTogether with BENRO, BEST, Coca-Cola\n&nbsp;\nPhilippines, and our dedicated micro-retailers, we have the power to effect real change and preserve\n&nbsp;\nour environment for future generations,\u201d he added.&nbsp;\nHow does TEM benefit micro-retailers?\n&nbsp;\nThrough Tindahan Extra Mile, participating micro-retailers will receive financial incentives by\n&nbsp;\ncollecting PET plastic bottles. The program encourages the community to partake in a shared\n&nbsp;\nresponsibility towards a cleaner Bacolod by providing convenient collection points in front of sari-sari\n&nbsp;\nstores and carinderias. Residents can easily drop off their empty bottles for recycling. Store owners\n&nbsp;\nwill accrue environmental points proportional to the bottles they collect, redeemable for cash or\n&nbsp;\nproducts through the bXTRA app.&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\nCoca-Cola Philippines, BEST, and the City Government of Bacolod engage micro-retailers\nto join Tindahan Extra Mile and set up PET bottle recycling bins in their stores.\n\u201cInvesting in the Tindahan Extra Mile program aligns perfectly with Coca-Cola Philippines\u2019\n&nbsp;\ngoal to collect and recycle the equivalent of every bottle we sell in the country. By empowering\n&nbsp;\nwomen micro-retailers, who make up a significant portion of sari-sari stores and carinderia owners in\n&nbsp;\nthe Philippines, TEM creates a convenient and accessible network for consumers to recycle,\u201d said\n&nbsp;\nPablo Medina, Senior Director for Franchise Operations at Coca-Cola Philippines. \u201cThis program not\n&nbsp;\nonly helps foster environmental responsibility but also provides opportunities for financial\n&nbsp;\nindependence and growth for these female entrepreneurs, driving positive change within their\n&nbsp;\ncommunities.\u201d\n&nbsp;\nHow can a micro-retailer become a TEM member?&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\nSari-sari store and carinderia owners in Bacolod City sign up to become members\nof the Tindahan Extra Mile Program.\nAny sari-sari store and carinderia owner can become a member of the Tindahan Extra Mile in\n&nbsp;\nthree easy steps.\n&nbsp;\nStep 1: On the Tindahan Extra Mile Facebook page, sign up on the bXTRA&nbsp; website using your email address.&nbsp;&nbsp;\nStep 2: Collect empty PET plastic bottles and bring them to the nearest TEM&nbsp; Trash to Cashback Collection Hub.&nbsp;&nbsp;\nStep 3: Exchange your PET bottles for a TEM kit and card to start earning&nbsp; environmental points.&nbsp;&nbsp;\nWatch\nhere\nto learn more about Tindahan Extra Mile.\n&nbsp;\nBEST Senior Vice President Jan Vincent Mercado urges micro-retailers to join TEM as\n&nbsp;\nmembers. \u201cIn partnership with Coca-Cola Philippines, our aim is to empower micro- entrepreneurs to\n&nbsp;\nbecome environmental stewards,\u201d he said. \u201cWe acknowledge their significance and influence within\n&nbsp;\ncommunities, emphasizing their potential to encourage community members to segregate plastic\n&nbsp;\nwaste and participate in recycling endeavors,\u201d Mercado said.\n&nbsp;\nEmpowering micro-retailers for a World Without Waste\n&nbsp;\nTo enable more micro-retailers and inspire collective action towards plastic bottle recycling,\n&nbsp;\nCoca-Cola Philippines will bring the Tindahan Extra Mile Program to other areas such as Cebu and\n&nbsp;\nCagayan de Oro in 2024.\n&nbsp;\nLast year, Coca-Cola Philippines launched its consumer engagement program, \u201cMay\n&nbsp;\nIkabobote Pa\u201d, to educate, inspire, and engage more consumers to return their empty bottles and\n&nbsp;\ncans for recycling.\n&nbsp;\nTo advance the circularity of plastic packaging, the company also introduced new bottles\n&nbsp;\nmade from 100% recycled PET plastic. This packaging innovation is now available in Coca-Cola\n&nbsp;\nOriginal 190ml, Wilkins Pure 500ml, and Sprite 500ml.

This alarming figure represents a significant 65.4 percent surge compared to the previous year\u2019s tally of 3,758 confirmed cases. Tragically, the dengue mortality rate in the city has also witnessed a distressing escalation, with recorded deaths soaring from 21 in 2022 to a heartbreaking 51 in 2023.1\nThus, as part of the city\u2019s strengthened anti-dengue efforts, the Philippine Pediatric Society Davao Southern Mindanao Chapter (PPS-DSMC), in partnership with the DOH Region 11 and Takeda Healthcare Philippines, organized a dengue awareness lecture at Barangay Talomo Proper in Davao City.\nEmpowering local communities to fight dengue\nThe Philippine Pediatric Society Davao Southern Mindanao Chapter together with Department of Health Region XI conducted a dengue awareness lecture at Barangay Talomo Proper in Davao City. Health experts shared practical tips to prevent dengue and manage its symptoms.\nDengue is an acute mosquito-borne viral infection common in tropical countries like the Philippines. The dengue virus (DENV) is transmitted through a bite of dengue infected Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. According to the Department of Health (DOH), during warmer, summer months these mosquitoes can lay eggs in any space or container that holds clear and stagnant water like a bottle cap, dish dryer, plant axil, gutter, trash can, old rubber tire, and similar vessels. They usually bite between 2 hours after sunrise and 2 hours before sunset and can be found inside and outside the house.2,3,4\nDuring the awareness campaign lecture, Kagawad Rizza Blanco, Chairperson of the Barangay Committee on Health and Sanitation, Dr. Farrah Faro, the dedicated barangay health officer, and over 80 participants, including health workers, sanitation personnel, community social workers, and representatives of community organizations, gathered with a shared purpose: to enhance their knowledge and skills in the battle against this relentless disease.\nEmbarking on a mission to empower communities, Dr. Diana Dadia, a Pediatric Intensivist, and Marie Cris Modequillo, a dedicated medical technologist from DOH Region 11, shared invaluable insights on dengue prevention, control, and disease management. Their expertise shed light on the critical aspects of this relentless disease.\nAccording to Dr. Dadia, recognizing the symptoms of dengue is vital. These include high fever, severe headache, joint and muscle pain, red spots on the body, fatigue, nausea, and vomiting. In severe cases, dengue can progress to dengue hemorrhagic fever or dengue shock syndrome, characterized by abdominal pain, bleeding, difficulty breathing, and a significant decrease in blood pressure. Diagnosis involves blood tests, while treatment focuses on symptom relief, hydration, and supportive care, as there is currently no specific antiviral medication. Severe cases may require interventions such as intravenous fluid replacement, blood transfusions, and intensive care monitoring. It is crucial to note that dengue can have long-term side effects, underscoring the importance of seeking immediate medical attention for suspected cases, particularly in endemic areas.\nMeanwhile, Ms. Modequillo emphasized the significance of communication campaigns on cleanliness, the use of insecticide-laced mosquito nets and repellents, as well as the implementation of local government health ordinances and initiatives. These strategies play a pivotal role in prevention, ensuring that communities are equipped with the knowledge and resources to combat dengue effectively.\nThe Davao CHO also announced the strict implementation of Ordinance No. 0401-20, Series of 2020, which mandates the creation of a Dengue Task Force in barangays as part of strengthening efforts to combat dengue.\n\u201cIn our commitment to dengue advocacy, we have fortified our programs and activities against the rising dengue cases. Dengue is no longer a seasonal concern but a persistent endemic challenge, necessitating heightened efforts,\u201d said Dr. Cleofe Llanos, President PPS-DSMC. \u201cOur collaboration with the Department of Health (DOH) and City Health reflects our dedication to raising awareness and educating the public on different diseases and vaccinations.\u201d\nStrengthening public health interventions\nRepresentatives from the Philippine Medical Society, Philippine Pediatric Society in Southern Mindanao, Department of Health Region XI, provincial and city health offices gathered to discuss best practices in dengue prevention and management. Infectious disease experts also shared global updates on immunization and vaccine development.\nImmunization programs are considered among the most important public health interventions. Governments diligently enhance national immunization programs by consistently bolstering their infrastructure, implementing rigorous monitoring mechanisms, and expanding outreach initiatives. These proactive measures aim to fortify vaccine coverage, ensuring comprehensive protection against a spectrum of preventable diseases.5\n\u201cIn the National Immunization Plan, the assessment considers the vaccine\u2019s impact, analyzing how many vaccinated individuals will be protected, even those not directly vaccinated. It\u2019s essential to focus on vulnerable age groups,\u201d highlighted Dr. Rontgene Solante, President of the Philippine College of Physicians.\nThe WHO\u2019s Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) recommends considering the use of a live-attenuated tetravalent second-generation dengue vaccine, for introduction in areas with high dengue disease burden and transmission intensity, particularly for children aged 6 to 16, targeting the age-specific peak incidence of dengue-related hospitalizations, which should be 1- 2 years earlier.6\nOne of the dengue vaccines, TAK003, is currently available for children and adults in the private market in more than 30 countries across Europe, Indonesia, Thailand, and Brazil.\n\u201cOur primary goal is to regain the public\u2019s confidence, alleviate fears, and enhance trust to address vaccine hesitancy,\u201d noted Dr. Ma. Delta Aguilar, Pediatric Infectious Disease Consultant. \u201cAdopting a patient-centered health paradigm is crucial. This involves examining vaccine hesitancy within families and among healthcare professionals, addressing trust issues, and building confidence.\u201d\nPartnerships are crucial in protecting public health from the menace of dengue. By cultivating collaborations, communities can establish an extensive network committed to increasing awareness, executing proactive healthcare initiatives, and strengthening defenses against dengue. This strategy not only emphasizes the vital role of collective action in preserving and advancing public health, but also serves as a powerful reminder of the importance of unity and collaboration in our pursuit of a healthier future.\nTo learn more about prevention tips and latest health updates on dengue, follow Iwas Dengue on Facebook:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/iwasdenguepilipinas\nor visit the website\nhttp://iwas-dengue.ph\n.\nADVT.&nbsp;\nREAD MORE\nREAD NEXT\nChina ships in Benham Rise clear intrusion, of great concern&amp;#...\nPH says China \u2018deliberately stirring up trouble\u2019 i...\nEDITORS' PICK\nVP Sara Duterte wrong to say DOJ is 'biased' \u2013 exec\nSenate bill seeks to crack down on ticket scalpers\nSteve Kerr rips officiating in Warriors NBA Cup loss to Rockets\nKababaihan donates TV sets for women's jail's ALS program\nAlex Eala celebrates stellar year with high hopes for 2025\nFiesta Se\u00f1or 2025: Registration for Fluvial Procession begins\nMOST READ\nTeodoro says petitions to cancel candidacy \u2018political maneuvering\u2019\nSofronio Vasquez looks back on Rey Valera's advice after 'The Voice' US win\n3 persons, including 3-month-old baby, killed in Maguindanao ambush\nPhilHealth\u2019s zero subsidy for 2025 an insult to members \u2013 group\nFollow\n@FMangosingINQ\non Twitter\n-->\nView comments",

        "content": "Dr. Jose Rizal, the national hero of the Philippines, stands as an icon of intellectual brilliance, patriotism, and resilience. Beyond his indelible mark on the nation\u2019s history, Rizal\u2019s Chinese immigrant ancestral roots unveil a remarkable tale of perseverance, economic success, and cultural contributions.&nbsp;\nIn particular, his Chinese immigrant ancestor, Domingo Lamco, represents a narrative of triumph over adversity that echoes the broader contributions of the Chinese community to the Philippines.\nCarlos Botong Francisco 1960 painting of The Execution of Dr. Jose Rizal, part of the collection of Museo ni Jose Rizal in historic Fort Santiago in Intramuros, Manila\nThroughout Philippine history, Rizal and other Filipino heroes of Chinese heritage have contributed much to the Filipino nation\u2019s quest for freedom, economic development and progress.&nbsp;\nDomingo Lamco: A Beacon of Resilience\nDomingo Lamco, also known by his Chinese name Cua Yi-Lam (\u201cKe Yi-Nan\u201d in Mandarin), was a trailblazer in the face of oppressive Spanish colonial conditions. Born in the village of Zhangguo (\u201cSiongque\u201d in Hokkien) in Jinjiang County (now a city), Quanzhou City, Fujian province, Lamco navigated the tumultuous era of Spanish colonization. Segregated in the Parian ghetto along with other Chinese traders and artisans, Lamco overcame hardships and&nbsp; persecution.\nQing Dynasty era junk sailboat used by traders &amp; migrants like Dr. Jose Rizal ancestor Domingo Lamco\nOvercoming adversity, Lamco was a \u201crags-to-riches\u201d entrepreneur and later moved to Laguna province to become the founder of the high-educated, esteemed Mercado family. \u201cMercado\u201d was an adopted surname by Domingo Lamco for his children and descendants. The Mercado family would later play a significant role in shaping the economic, cultural, and social fabric of the Philippines.\nPhilanthropic Endeavors\nOver the centuries, Filipino Chinese individuals and organizations, such as the Federation of Filipino Chinese Chambers of Commerce and Industry, Inc. (FFCCCII) with 170 Filipino Chinese chambers of commerce nationwide from Aparri to Tawi Tawi, have been at the forefront of philanthropy and diverse charities. Their financial and logistical contributions to education, healthcare, arts and culture, religious faith and social welfare showcase a commitment to Philippine nation-building.\nJose Rizal: A Testament to Chinese Influence\nThe legacy of Rizal and his Chinese forebear, Domingo Lamco, serves as a testament to the enduring positive impact of Chinese influence on the Philippines. This influence transcends beyond trade and&nbsp; economic modernization of Philippine life, encompassing rich cultural exchange, resilience in the face of adversity, and a shared commitment to nation-building.\nPhilippine Consulate General in Xiamen City, China laid flower wreath at 18.61 meter high Rizal Monument in Zhangguo Village, Jinjiang City, Quanzhou, Fujian province on Dec. 30, 2021\nDomingo Lamco\u2019s journey from a segregated ghetto trader to the founder of a distinguished \u201cilustrado\u201d Filipino family underscores the resilience and contributions of the Chinese community. As the Philippines embraces its multicultural and democratic identity, the intertwined stories of Rizal and his Chinese immigrant forebear Domingo Lamco stand as a symbol of unity in cultural diversity, forging a path toward a shared and progressive Philippine future.\nGen. Jose Ignacio Paua, Roman Ongpin, Gen. Vicente Lim &amp; other Filipino heroes of Chinese heritage\nIn the long protracted history of Philippine struggle against colonial rule, woven with threads of courage, sacrifice, and resilience, there emerges a distinct and often unfortunately overlooked pattern \u2013 the important presence and contributions by Filipino heroes of Chinese heritage. These champions of freedom and progress came from an ethnic minority which has for many centuries lived and traded in the Philippines since the pre-colonial era.&nbsp;\nHere are only some of the many other Filipino heroes of Chinese heritage:\nGeneral Jose Ignacio Paua, Chinese immigrant who became a hero in Phil. Revolution against Spanish &amp; American colonizers\nGeneral Jose Ignacio Paua\n\u2014A first-generation Chinese immigrant from the county of Nan-an,Quanzhou City, Fujian province, he&nbsp; exemplified the spirit of self-determination and public service. His journey from blacksmith entrepreneur in Manila to military general of the Philippine Revolution against Spanish colonizers and then the American colonial invaders from the 1890s to 1900s mirrors the transformative power of dedication to a cause larger than oneself.&nbsp;\nGeneral Paua not only forged armaments for the Filipino revolutionaries but also orchestrated successful fundraising campaigns among his fellow Hokkien-speaking ethnic Chinese traders, artisans and professionals in different regions. In doing so, he became a unique beacon, perhaps the only first-generation immigrant worldwide to rise to the rank of a military general in his adopted homeland.\nMonument of anti colonial hero Roman Ongpin in Ongpin Street, Binondo, Manila, this was donated by Ong clan association of the Philippines\nRoman Tanbensiang Ongpin\n\u2014A 19th-century entrepreneur and civic leader, son of successful Chinese immigrant trader Simon Ongpin (Chinese name \u201cOng Yak Pin\u201d from ChingMeng Village, Jinjiang, Quanzhou City, Fujian province), Roman Ongpin etched his name in history by sacrificing personal safety and social status to support the Philippine Revolution.\nEnduring persecution and imprisonment, Ongpin became a symbol of resilience and commitment. His legacy lives on in the streets of Binondo, where Calle Sacristia had been renamed in his honor, and the Ong clan association had donated a monument which stands testament to his unwavering dedication. His descendants also contributed to Philippine progress, the late billionaire tycoon Roberto Ongpin who was brilliant Trade and Industry Minister of President Ferdinand E. Marcos in the martial law era, and 1986 Edsa Revolution stalwart Jaime Ongpin who became Finance Secretary of the revolutionary government of Chinese merstiza President Corazon \u201cCory\u201d Cojuangco Aquino.&nbsp;\nBrigadier General Vicente Lim, first Filipino West Point graduate, World War II hero executed by Japanese invaders, son of a Chinese immigrant trader\nGeneral Vicente Lim\n\u2014The son of a Chinese immigrant turned self-made entrepreneur, General Vicente Lim embodied the pursuit of excellence and unswerving service to his country. As the first Filipino soldier to graduate from the prestigious West Point military academy, Lim rose to the rank of a military general. In the face of Japanese military invasion during World War II, he fought valiantly, enduring imprisonment and ultimately sacrificing his life. General Vicente Lim stands as a beacon of heroism and moral courage, his story has become an integral part of the Philippines\u2019 struggle for freedom.\nSt. Lorenzo Ruiz, first Filipino Catholic saint, son of Chinese immigrant of Lee clan\nSt. Lorenzo Ruiz\n\u2014He was the first Filipino Roman Catholic saint, son of a Chinese immigrant and baptized in historic Binondo Church. His life epitomized courage and faith, culminating in martyrdom for his beliefs.&nbsp;\nWenceslao Vinzons, World War II hero &amp; martyr of Bicol region, member of the Sia family\nWenceslao \u201cBintao\u201d Vinzons\n\u2014He was a legendary Bicol hero and fearless World War II martyr, who led the resistance against Japanese military occupation and was executed by the invaders. Vinzons ably led Filipino guerrillas who killed 3,000 Japanese soldiers in the Bicol region. The hero\u2019s grandfather was anti-Qing Dynasty Chinese-language newspaper \u201cKong Li Po\u201d editor Serafin Vinzons (Chinese name \u201cSia Hui Tam\u201d) and his father was Gabino Vinzons (Chinese name \u201cSia Din Long\u201d).&nbsp;\nVinzons\u2019 legacy lives on at the University of the Philippines (U.P.), where a building bears his name since he was brilliant President of the U.P. Student Council and Editor-in-Chief of the college newspaper \u201cPhilippine Collegian\u201d. He was also youngest delegate elected to the 1935 Philippine Constitutional Convention.\nThese are just some of the many Filipino heroes of Chinese heritage\u2014along with countless nameless traders, artisans and other ordinary members of the Filipino Chinese community\u2014who have contributed immeasurably to the economic modernization, cultural development and social progress of the Philippines. As we honor the patriotism of Dr. Jose Rizal, let us also pay tribute to these remarkable heroes, acknowledging their pivotal role in shaping the destiny of a nation.\nADVT.\nREAD MORE\nREAD NEXT\nChina reiterates claim over Ayungin Shoal; opposes PH plan to ...\nChina tells US to stop emboldening PH\u2019s provocations in WPS\nEDITORS' PICK\nSteve Kerr rips officiating in Warriors NBA Cup loss to Rockets\nFiesta Se\u00f1or 2025: Registration for Fluvial Procession begins\n2 more hotel workers charged for the death of Liam Payne\nPriscilla Meirelles wins new beauty title, Teresa Loyzaga fulfills pageantry dreams\nFilipinos urged to go digital in giving Christmas cash gifts\nTolentino leads awarding of land titles to 4,029 Bukidnon farmers\nMOST READ\nTeodoro says petitions to cancel candidacy \u2018political maneuvering\u2019\nSofronio Vasquez looks back on Rey Valera's advice after 'The Voice' US win\nINQToday: Grijaldo skips House quad panel probe for the 4th time; held in contempt\nPhilHealth\u2019s zero subsidy for 2025 an insult to members \u2013 group\nFollow\n@FMangosingINQ\non Twitter\n-->\nView comments",

The better news is that even with these so many projects and the return to face-to-face meetings this year, we will still post a positive bottom line this year, with improved total assets and healthy cash position.\nThis will be a good starting point for the incoming 2024 board elected with the highest voters\u2019 turnout ever in the history of MAP, where 49 percent of total membership participated.\nAll that was accomplished was because so many had contributed their efforts, time, funds and all-out support to the board and MAP. Together, we all enabled a strengthened MAP organization that capacitated us to pursue our mission of management excellence, be the voice in social and national development, the hub of innovative ideas and solutions, and the leadership that keeps pushing our advocacies forward.\nI am personally thankful for the opportunity to serve.

(AFI) and Communities Organized for Resource Allocation (CORA) Nonprofit.\nAboitiz Land\u2019s environmental conservation efforts at Seafront Residences received the prestigious Silver Award in the Environmental Category at the FIABCI Philippines Property and Real Estate Excellence Awards 2022.\nThe shores of San Juan provide vital economic livelihoods and recreation opportunities community members wish to preserve. However, seasonal coastal threats from marine pollution, especially plastic waste, have heightened concerns around habitat and ecosystem protection in the area.\nCoastal Cleanup Amihan at Seafront Residences showcases Aboitiz Land\u2019s ongoing dedication to sustainability, reflecting their proactive approach to preserving our coastal ecosystems.

With plastic pollution levels rising globally, this surplus seasonal influx jeopardizes community health and treasured spaces for livelihoods and leisure.\nDubbed \u2018Coastal Cleanup Amihan,\u2019 Named after the \u2018Amihan\u2019 winds, which characterize the strong monsoon season spanning from late October to early April, the initiative specifically addresses the environmental challenges along the coastline of Brgy. Calubcub II.\nThe initiative convened the locals, government agencies, and private sectors unified in one shared mission\u2014 raising public awareness on the impact of plastic products and other disposable items that end up as marine debris that threatens not only aquatic life but also our very own communities.\nJoining the effort are the Seafront Residents, Aboitiz Land employees, Municipal Environmental and Natural Resources Office (MENRO) San Juan Batangas and MENRO Sariaya Quezon, Philippine Coast Guard, Barangay Calubcub Officials, and PNP San Juan.\n\u201cNon-biodegradable debris, especially plastics, threaten not only the health of our oceans long-term, but the ability of communities like San Juan to enjoy clean and thriving coastal habitats,\u201d said Aboitiz Land CEO David Rafael. \u201cCleanups like Amihan represent the commitment of the locals and private sectors to preserve our coastal environments and ensure access to stunning seascape views of the province.\u201d\nWhile the annual Coastal Cleanup happens during September, locals identified the Amihan season as needing special attention due to the sheer volume of debris ending up on their shores during this time of the year.&nbsp;\nVolunteers collected nearly 750 kg of plastic waste, including bottles, wrappers, caps, sachets and styrofoam. Armed with trash bags and pick-up tools, the teams fanned out along the coastline to promote cleanliness and help restore ecological balance.\nThe massive volume of marine debris and plastic waste products collected by Coastal Cleanup Amihan calls for the urgent need to make more conscientious consumption choices to avoid harming our environment as part of shared responsibility to one another.\nAboitiz Foundation President and Chief Operating Officer Maribeth Marasigan commended the day\u2019s accomplishments, saying \u201cthe clean-up efforts contribute to a cleaner, brighter future for our oceans and shores. When we change today, we can shape the future and create a sustainable legacy. Let us continue the work, and may this mark the continuation of a more eco-conscious journey for all of us.\u201d\nWhile Coastal Cleanup Amihan is a huge success, Aboitiz Land highlights that consistent effort is still critically needed to curb the influx of ocean waste each Amihan season. Continuing its commitment to the people and environment, the company vows to lead preservation and restoration efforts to keep the shores pristine and welcoming for families and community members along the San Juan coast.\nADVT.\nREAD MORE\nREAD NEXT\nTowards achieving zero-dengue deaths\nChina condemns Canada\u2019s support for PH on South China Se...\nEDITORS' PICK\nTolentino leads awarding of land titles to 4,029 Bukidnon farmers\nFilipinos urged to go digital in giving Christmas cash gifts\nAlex Eala celebrates stellar year with high hopes for 2025\nFiesta Se\u00f1or 2025: Registration for Fluvial Procession begins\nSouth Korea\u2019s Yoon vows to fight \u2018until the very last minute\u2019\nVP Sara Duterte wrong to say DOJ is 'biased' \u2013 exec\nMOST READ\nTeodoro says petitions to cancel candidacy \u2018political maneuvering\u2019\nSofronio Vasquez looks back on Rey Valera's advice after 'The Voice' US win\n3 persons, including 3-month-old baby, killed in Maguindanao ambush\nPhilHealth\u2019s zero subsidy for 2025 an insult to members \u2013 group\nFollow\n@FMangosingINQ\non Twitter\n-->\nView comments",

We participate in culture in many ways\u2014as audiences, professionals, amateurs, volunteers, and donors or investors.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nIn addition to its intrinsic value, culture provides important social and economic benefits. With improved learning and health, increased tolerance, and opportunities to come together with others, culture enhances our quality of life and increases overall wellbeing for both individuals and communities.\nFEATURED STORIES\nBUSINESS\nBIZ BUZZ: Surprise! MVP revives Smart Money\nBUSINESS\nTrump is Time's Person of the Year, rings NYSE's opening bell\nBUSINESS\nFilipinos urged to go digital in giving Christmas cash gifts\nIndividual and social benefits of culture\nParticipating in culture is a source of delight and can provide emotionally and intellectually moving experiences that encourage celebration or contemplation. Culture is also a means of expressing creativity, forging an individual identity, and enhancing or preserving a community\u2019s sense of place.\nCultural opportunities are opportunities for leisure, entertainment, learning, and sharing experiences with others. From historic churches to theaters to museums to dance studios to art galleries to festivals, culture brings people together.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nIn children and youth, participation in culture helps develop thinking skills, builds self-esteem, and improves resilience, all of which enhance education outcomes.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nFor example, students from low-income families who take part in arts activities at school are three times more likely to get a degree than those who do not. In a number of countries, schools that integrate arts in their curriculum have shown consistently higher average reading and mathematics scores compared with similar schools that do not.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nCultural heritage broadens opportunities for education and lifelong learning, including a better understanding of history. Our cities\u2019 cultural heritage can be the source of educational products and learning resources designed around built heritage assets and cultural landscapes.\nHealthy population\nParticipation in culture also contributes to healthy populations in several ways.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nCreativity and cultural engagement have shown to improve both mental and physical health. Culture can be integrated into health care. A growing body of research demonstrates that the arts can improve the health and well-being of older adults. Participation in the arts can relieve isolation and promote identity formation and intercultural understanding.\nVigan, with its preserved Calle Crisologo, is another UNESCO World Heritage Site. (HTTPS://EN.WIKIPEDIA.ORG)\nStudies have found that active participation in the arts have positive health benefits, such as social cohesion and emotional and physical well-being. In many of our older towns and cities, culture is simultaneously art, creative expression, religious practice, ritual models and markers of territorial heritage as well as maps of individual and community identity and lineage. Research has shown that the revitalization of indigenous cultures plays a key role in supporting the health, wellbeing and healing of individuals and communities.\nSocial capital\nThe benefits of culture for individuals can spill over to society as a whole.\nCulture helps build social capital, the glue that holds communities together. By bringing people together, cultural activities such as festivals, town fiestas, fairs or classes create social solidarity and cohesion, fostering social inclusion, community empowerment, and capacity-building, and enhancing confidence, civic pride and tolerance.\nThe social capital created through culture increases with regular participation in cultural activities. Cultural engagement also plays a role in poverty reduction and strategies for communities at risk.\nCulture is important to the vitality of communities. Research in many countries have shown direct connections between culture and community revitalization. Social networks created through community-based arts initiatives can result in direct economic benefits for the neighborhood, such as new uses of existing facilities, and new jobs for local artists.\nA student dance troupe performing a traditional folk dance (MARGIE DOMINGUEZ VIA PINTEREST)\nOur diverse cultural heritage resources tell the story of our shared past, fostering social cohesion. They are intrinsic to our sense of place. Investments in heritage streetscapes have been shown to have a positive impact on sense of place. Benefits include improved quality of life for local residents, a feeling of pride, identification with the past, and a sense of belonging to a wider community.\nCulture helps cities develop compelling city narratives and distinctive brands, with unique selling points for tourists and business investors. Culturally rich districts also enhance competitiveness by attracting talents and businesses. Cultural heritage is also a factor in rural redevelopment, supporting tourism, community renewal, and the conservation of farms.\nEconomic benefits of culture\nThe culture sector helps spur the economy and innovation in other sectors in the form of productivity advancements, regional development, community branding, and increased local tourism.\nEconomic opportunities created by culture have taken on greater importance as economies transition from the industrial model and work based on physical labor to a new model in which knowledge and creativity drive productivity and growth. Knowledge-based economies favor ideas to stimulate innovation, and they develop specialized services and highly customized products to create value. Information, technology, and learning are central to their performance.\nA good example of the kind of culture-based jobs and businesses is film and television production, which includes computer animation, visual effects, and post-production facilities.\nContribution to tourism\nCulture particularly makes a significant contribution to the tourism industry throughout the Philippines, further supporting job creation and encouraging infrastructure development.\nThe many festivals and events hosted each year in many cities and towns of the country, coupled with historic churches and sites, ancestral houses, art galleries and museums, are magnets of cultural tourists. A significant percentage of foreign tourists who visit the Philippines often seek out cultural activities on their visit.\nThe Miag-ao Church in Iloilo has been listed by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site. (HTTPS://GUIDETOTHEPHILIPPINES.PH)\nThere are significant opportunities to grow cultural tourism through marketing cultural heritage assets and historic sites. There are also opportunities for promoting music tourism as a means of showcasing local talents and promoting their work. Local music scenes can help brand communities to attract local as well as foreign tourists.\nStrengthening communities\nThe role of culture in strengthening communities is increasingly being recognized the world over. Many strategies incorporate culture into city/town planning to enrich quality of life for their residents, create a unique sense of place, and reap economic benefits through cultural tourism and revitalized neighborhoods.\nWith the many direct and indirect contribution to GDP, many towns and cities throughout the world are examining ways of enhancing the economic benefits of culture, adopting measures to fuel innovation, promote their creative industries globally, and strengthen the financial capacity of companies and individuals producing creative products and services. They are designing policies to foster business innovation, assist producers in accessing international markets, and encouraging capital investment through new financing models.\nIn our changing environment, the need for new technical, business, and other skills has made investing in the culture sector workforce a high priority. In some countries, this begins with education and training in schools, especially in digital skills. Leadership and management skills are another focus area as the ageing population makes succession planning in cultural organizations increasingly critical.\nThe Malasimbo Music and Arts Festival in Puerto Galera in Mindoro attracts many foreign musicians and artists every March. (HTTPS://WWW.VACATIONSTRAVEL.COM)\nMost countries are encouraging collaboration and partnerships as a strategic direction. Partnerships and consortia can help creators and organizations meet financing and other resource requirements while sharing expertise.\nCollaboration across disciplines and sectors such as business, health, education, and technology can lead to innovation in art as well as new products and new revenue-sharing opportunities.\nYour subscription could not be saved.

There are thousands more stories like it, each one providing a frame for one of the worst wildfires in U.S. history.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nFive years later, some \u2014 like Nordgren \u2014 are sharing their stories freely and managing their post-traumatic stress enough to return to Paradise to help make something new.

We toss and turn all night,\u201d said Bernacette, who moved with her husband to Yuma, Arizona, to escape the risk of future wildfires.

We will never live amongst the trees again.\u201d\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nPowered By\n10 Sec\nSignal no. 4 up in Batanes due to Super Typhoon Leon | INQToday\nNext\nStay\nFor people who returned to Paradise, life is about adjusting. It\u2019s the same place, but doesn\u2019t feel the same. Paradise was once so thick with trees it was hard to tell the town was perched on a ridge. Now, the shadows are gone as sunlight bathes the town on clear days, offering impressive views of the canyons.\nToday\u2019s population of just under 10,000 is less than half the 26,000 who lived there before the blaze.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThe Camp Fire destroyed about 11,000 homes, which amounted to about 90% of the town\u2019s structures. So far 2,500 homes have been rebuilt. About 700 are under construction at any one time, many on original lots. But just six of the town\u2019s 36 mobile home parks that served mostly low-income and older residents have reopened.\nDonna Hooton and her husband lived in one of the mobile home parks destroyed by the fire. The Hootons live off of Social Security and said they can\u2019t afford to move to Paradise. They now live an hour away, in a small, decades-old mobile home.\n\u201cWe wish we could go home but home is not there anymore,\u201d Hooton said.\nParadise Mayor Greg Bolin says that by 2025 all of the town\u2019s overhead power lines will be buried underground. By 2026, he says all public roads will be repaved.\n\u201cI can see what it\u2019s going to look like. I know how nice it is going to be when it\u2019s done,\u201d said Bolin, who also owns Trilogy Construction Inc., one of the town\u2019s main construction companies.\nFor the most part, Bolin said it is \u201camazing, in five years, how well people are doing.\u201d But then a whiff of smoke will linger in the air, and it instantly brings residents back to that terrible day. It happened just last month, when Derrick Harlan \u2014 a 34-year-old Paradise resident whose business reduces fire hazards \u2014 got a permit to burn some debris piles in Paradise.\nWhen neighbors saw smoke from the debris fire though, they called the police. The next day, the fire department showed up.\n\u201cThat\u2019s where the trauma and the PTSD comes in,\u201d Harlan said.\nWildfires have always been a part of life in California, but they are getting more severe as climate change has caused hotter, drier summers. Seven of the state\u2019s top 10 most destructive fires happened in the past decade. Before the Camp Fire killed 85 people, the state\u2019s deadliest was a 1933 blaze that killed 29. More recently, a 2017 fire shocked the state as it ripped through suburban neighborhoods in California wine country, killing 22.\nBut the Camp Fire, the official name of the Paradise fire, marked a turning point.\nNow, utility companies routinely shut off power for millions of people during wind storms in an effort to prevent fires from starting. Major property insurance companies have raised homeowners\u2019 rates to exponential highs or dropped coverage for many in wildfire-prone areas. Other providers have simply stopped writing new policies altogether. PG&amp;E pleaded guilty to 84 counts of manslaughter, filed for bankruptcy and announced plans to bury 10,000 miles of power lines. The town has installed warning sirens and is working to create more evacuation routes.\nBut just when it seemed safe to think that what happened in Paradise was a once-in-a-lifetime fire, it happened again \u2014 this time thousands of miles away in Maui, Hawaii. It meant April Kelly, who grew up in Paradise and lived in Maui for 16 years, lost both of her hometowns.\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m going through this a second time,\u201d she said.\nFinding ways to cope with that grief has become a shared part of life in Paradise. The local theater saved Judy Clemens, giving her a space to channel her passion for live performance after the blaze. The Theatre on the Ridge opened to host its first show on Valentine\u2019s Day in 2019.\n\u201cIf the theater had gone, too, I really would have been lost,\u201d Clemens said.\nFor Samuel Walker, making peace with the fire meant making peace with God. The pastor of the First Baptist Church of Paradise was wracked with guilt over the death of Bob Quinn, a church member who Walker likened to a second father. On the day of the fire, Walker drove by the street where Quinn lived and for a moment, thought about checking on him. Instead, he rescued his parents, who would not have been able to escape the fire on their own.\nWalker learned of Quinn\u2019s death three days after the fire, while he was in Fresno with his family. Thieves had just broken into Walker\u2019s car and stolen the only things his wife and daughter had saved from their house \u2014 including photos, an iPad and a knitting machine.\nHe was angry about his situation, everything that had happened and all of the people who had died or been hurt. For a pastor, being mad at God is a bigger problem than most.\n\u201cHow am I going to minister to a congregation with all of these people with all of their issues, if I\u2019m still trying to get through mine?\u201d Walker asked.\nHe finally found peace after a trip to the hospital, of all places. Walker injured his arm after a fall while taking out the trash. In the hospital, he immediately thought of a Bible verse from the New Testament that says: \u201cThe Lord disciplines everyone he loves.\u201d\n\u201cIt was almost kind of a healing point \u2026 to say, \u2018OK Lord, I\u2019m going to let this go. I\u2019m going to stop being angry and get back to what you have me here to do,\u2019\u201d Walker said.\nBusinesses are returning to Paradise, with recent openings of a Big Lots and Ross Dress for Less sending ripples of excitement through town. Town leaders plan to begin installing a sewer system next summer for the business district, which would allow more restaurants to operate.\nThat will help Nicki Jones\u2019 restaurant, a deli and wine bar called Nic\u2019s. Jones first came to Paradise 25 years ago. She called it a \u201cfluke,\u201d a place to retire with her husband. The town quickly became much more than that. She opened two businesses: a candle shop and a women\u2019s clothing store. Both burned in the fire, along with her home.\nAfter the fire, there was no time for rest or reflection. She had a community to rebuild. With a background in accounting she knew what to do. She started by calling her insurance companies. Within 30 days of the fire, she was able to buy a building. Within a year, she opened a restaurant called Nic\u2019s, what she said is the first new business to open in Paradise after the fire.\n\u201cEverybody reacts to whatever tragedy there is \u2014 and we all have them \u2014 but my way has always been to jump in. How can I fix it?\u201d she said. \u201cI wanted a place where everybody could come and feel comfortable and feel normal.\u201d\nThe best time to go to Nic\u2019s is for \u201cWine room Wednesdays,\u201d when lots of locals stop by for a drink and a hug. That sometimes includes Adam Thompson, who is not from Paradise. After the pandemic, Thompson and his family were looking for a quiet community in the foothills to raise their family. In 2021, they moved to Magalia, just outside of Paradise.\nIf the town is to grow, it needs new people. But newcomers face a daunting question: How do you assimilate into a community defined by a shared tragedy?\nThompson said his family was quickly accepted. His kids are enrolled in a local school. They play Little League baseball and perform in the local theater.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a humility and a resilience here that I don\u2019t think would be in a town like this had they not gone through the fire,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve never once felt excluded up here. I\u2019ve never felt judged. I\u2019ve only felt love and welcome from literally every single person I\u2019ve met.\u201d\nApril Kelly, who hails from Paradise and Maui, is now the general manager at Nic\u2019s. She is on the board of directors for a parent support group called Mom\u2019s on the Ridge. Samuel Walker is still the pastor of Paradise Baptist Church, now living with his family in nearby Magalia.\nBefore the fire, Paradise was viewed as a retirement community with mostly older residents. But that\u2019s changing. The Paradise Little League has had so much interest it\u2019s warned parents that kids may be turned away next year.\nThe town\u2019s rebirth has amazed Don Criswell, a Paradise native who moved back to the area in 1998. Wildfires burned his property in 2008 and again in 2018. Both times he stayed to fight the fires himself.\nThe Paradise of his memory has been erased. Personal landmarks \u2014 the house he grew up in, his elementary school \u2014 are gone. Most of his childhood friends and neighbors have since moved away.\nBut he hasn\u2019t gone anywhere. Instead, he has planted trees and a garden. He donates vegetables to a free community lunch put on by his church. He even plays the piano for people who come to eat.\nYour subscription could not be saved.

        "content": "Neil Felipp\u2019s designs have reached both Hollywood and red carpets all around the world, but everything he does is still for the Philippines\nA slight shopping addiction and a chance meeting is what led me into the studio of Neil Felipp San Pedro. Prior to meeting the\ndesigner\nin his shredded paper-filled room at the 2023 MaArte Fair, then at his Camputhaw studio in\nCebu\n(where we both hail from), all I knew about the designer was that I went to high school with his sisters and his bags are some of the most beautiful things I had ever seen.&nbsp;\nIn the fashion world, the Neil Felipp brand is known for creating the most decadent and exquisite\nminaudi\u00e8res\ninspired by fantasy and mythology. His handheld, functional jewelry has made it into the hands of names like Doja Cat, Dolly De Leon, Astrid Leung (yes, the fictional character from the \u201cCrazy Rich Asians\u201d series), and more.&nbsp;\nDesigner Neil Felipp San Pedro, the founder and current creative director of the Cebu-based brand Neil Felipp\nNeil Felipp San Pedro is the founder and current creative director of his eponymous brand who hails from a long line of metal artisans. He\u2019s a third generation jeweler and part of the latest generation of the Suarez and Sons jewelers of Cebu. Creativity has always been in his blood, but he doesn\u2019t limit himself to metalwork alone.&nbsp;\nPrior to starting his brand, San Pedro was a student of industrial design (now called product design) at the University of the Philippines Cebu. He interned for fellow Cebuano and internationally renowned furniture designer\nKenneth Cobonpue\n.&nbsp;\n\u201c[Kenneth] is still my mentor and still one of my biggest critics, which I love him for. He was fundamental to how I made my brand global, because of how he built his own brand from scratch.\u201d\nImmediately after apprenticing for Cobonpue for three years, San Pedro started his own studio in 2010. The first bag he ever produced though\u2014he admitted\u2014was a little bit of a happy accident.&nbsp;\nThe birth of a myth come to life\n\u201c[The first bag I ever made was] the Siren minaudi\u00e8re. It was back when I was starting, and it was completely by accident. My mom was attending a formal event. I forget which one, but I do remember what she was wearing. It was a midnight blue off shoulder gown by Philip Rodriguez. She wore beautiful sapphire jewels and beautiful blue shoes, but she didn\u2019t have a bag.\u201d\nUpon seeing her without a bag that could do his mom justice, he promised to make her one.&nbsp;\nThe Siren minaudi\u00e8re in blue capiz\n\u201c[It was] easier said than done because my mom is one of my biggest critics as well. Of course, because of how much she was exposed to matters of taste from my grandmother,\u201d he admits.&nbsp;\nTo make the perfect bag, he scoured his fondest memories with his mom, which was going to the beach on the island of Cebu. He quipped that every time he was at the beach, he always imagined himself as a mermaid.&nbsp;\n\u201cI reimagined [that memory] into a bag that we shared, which was The Siren. So it\u2019s not only an homage to my mom, it\u2019s also an homage to the island I call home.\u201d\nThe soul is in the story\nA single look at San Pedro\u2019s designs will reveal how storytelling is a quintessential aspect in his process. Most\u2014if not all\u2014of his bags hark back to mythology or elements of classic storytelling. And to date, most of his creative inspiration still comes from the myths he\u2019d read as a child.&nbsp;\n\u201cGrowing up, I loved reading books. One of the first books I ever read was on Greek mythology. The story of the Trojan War, of how the gods are born, and kind of insane how they became. I just loved the surreal aspect of it,\u201d he explains.&nbsp;\nSan Pedro holding the Medusa and Midas minaudi\u00e8re\nSan Pedro explains that with every bag, materials and the form are secondary. To him, its most important element is the story it\u2019s trying to tell.&nbsp;\n\u201cWhen I\u2019m designing, it\u2019s always [the] story. It\u2019s always a story that\u2019s the most fundamental for me. It\u2019s beyond the form\u2014it\u2019s beyond the material itself. It\u2019s also beyond functionality. It\u2019s the story, I would say, [that] is the soul of every piece.\u201d\nIf a bag could encapsulate that quality of storytelling, it would have to be his Medusa and Midas creation. The minaudi\u00e8re is made of hand-applied parchment with the signature brass hardware made to resemble snakes.&nbsp;\nSan Pedro\u2019s prompt for this specific handheld tale was \u201cWhat would happen if Medusa and Midas met and fell in love?\u201d\nThe Medusa and Midas minaudi\u00e8re in gray, which resembles stone\nFor those who are a little foggy on your mythology, Medusa\u2019s curse is that all who would look at her in her snake-haired glory would turn to stone, while Midas\u2019 curse is that everything he touches turns to gold.&nbsp;\n\u201cBoth cursed as they were, they decided on a deadly embrace. As Medusa turns to gold, while Midas turns to stone, their lips are forever in a kiss,\u201d San Pedro continues, breaking the spell of the story at the end with a laugh.&nbsp;\nThe international connection\nIn 2015, San Pedro gained another admirer in fellow storyteller Kevin Kwan, the author of the \u201cCrazy Rich Asians\u201d series. For fans of the series, you might remember San Pedro from the series\u2019 third novel, \u201cRich People Problems\u201d where the designer and his creations were mentioned. But his designs landing on the pages of the novel\u2014and then later, the big screen\u2014is not as crazy as the story behind it.&nbsp;\nWhen Kwan visited the Philippines in 2015 to promote the series\u2019 second novel \u201cChina Rich Girlfriend,\u201d it just so happened that one of San Pedro\u2019s clients attended the event sporting his Suzy Wong minaudir\u00e8re.&nbsp;\nHis client showed Kwan the bag, who was immediately impressed by its craftsmanship and asked who created it. The author ended up snapping a photo of the bag and posted it on his\nInstagram\n, where it went viral.&nbsp;\nThe Ruby Wong minaudi\u00e8re in green\nAs to be expected, San Pedro\u2019s phone was ringing off the hook with people sending messages about how Kwan noticed his work. After waking up to a mountain of messages and tags, he starts to slowly piece together what had happened in his sleep.&nbsp;\n\u201cI said, \u2018I\u2019ll be honest, who\u2019s Kevin Kwan?\u201d he laughs.&nbsp;\nSan Pedro then took to Instagram to thank Kwan for his kind words. The pair started talking about their respective crafts, to the point that Kwan asked San Pedro if he was willing to be part of his third book.&nbsp;\nThen when the greenlight for the movie came, it was only natural for Kwan to ask if he could use San Pedro\u2019s bags. And San Pedro, of course, obliged.&nbsp;\nHis Siren minaudi\u00e8re landed in the hands of Astrid Leung, which he revealed was a full-circle moment for him as a designer.&nbsp;\nThe Phoenix minaudi\u00e8re was inspired by Astrid Leung after the designer was introduced to the series. Its silhouette takes the shape of the sun, which San Pedro explains, gives the effect of the sun rising and setting with the wearer\n\u201cIt was so beautiful because the only person I really wanted [to wear the bag] was Astrid. She was actually the inspiration for the Phoenix [minaudi\u00e8re] because of how she presented herself and how she got out of that horrible marriage.\u201d\nNeil Felipp paints the town red\nWith a growing international client list, it\u2019s only par for the course for other celebrities and stylists to take note. Last year, singer and rapper Doja Cat was spotted walking the red carpet of New York Fashion Week toting San Pedro\u2019s signature red Suzy Wong minaudi\u00e8re.&nbsp;\nWhen I asked him how his bag landed in the hands of the artist, he jokes, \u201cOh you know, we were just hanging by the bar,\u201d and laughs. For San Pedro, it was another one of those stars aligning moments.&nbsp;\n\u201cIt was just luck that I worked with her, I think,\u201d he ponders.&nbsp;\nDoja Cat\u2019s stylists Brett Alan Nelson and LJ Perez (a fellow Filipino) reached out to San Pedro via email. \u201cI thought it was a joke,\u201d he admits, citing that he also thought it was a scam. After doing some due diligence, the stylists\u2019 information checked out. They were the real deal.&nbsp;\nThey asked for a few bags to be sent over for Doja Cat\u2019s New York Fashion Week look, and the next thing he knew, his designs were painting the carpets red.\nThe details of the Suzy Wong minaudi\u00e8re\nIn a seeming repeat of events, San Pedro went viral overnight (again) with people messaging him in his sleep about Doja Cat\u2019s red carpet appearance with his Suzy Wong minaudi\u00e8re in hand.&nbsp;\nAnd in perfect parallelism, his response to the congratulatory messages was, \u201cWho\u2019s Doja Cat? Is she friends with Ariana Grande?\u201d&nbsp;\nWe both shared a laugh as he shook his head, complaining that he sounded \u201cso old\u201d\u2014his words, not mine.&nbsp;\nBut he continues by saying that none of this fanfare would have been possible without the people who picked his designs for the star.&nbsp;\u201cLittle by little, we\u2019re working with more international stylists. And we\u2019re very grateful to them for having us,\u201d he concludes.&nbsp;\nMusings on muses\nOf the many celebrities and personalities he\u2019s worked with over the 13 years since his studio started, a few stand out to him. One of his current favorites is\nJasmine Curtis-Smith\n.&nbsp;\n\u201cHer energy is just so genuinely beautiful. She\u2019s a beautiful girl, no doubt about it. But I love her love for the Philippines,\u201d he gushes.&nbsp;\u201c[I love] her love for the Filipino, how she styles herself, and the energy she brings to her audience.\u201d\nWhen asked who he wanted to work with in the future, his first answer came as quickly as I asked.&nbsp;\n\u201cOh my god! Beyonce! That\u2019s an easy one,\u201d he laughs.&nbsp;\n\u201cWho else? I don\u2019t know, but Billy Porter would be one,\u201d he adds.&nbsp;\n\u201cI would love to work with Billy Porter. He\u2019s so forward thinking about his style and I love what he\u2019s doing with the LGBT community and HIV awareness.\u201d\nStars aside, icons\u2014and some that are very much close to home\u2014also serve as his eternal muses.&nbsp;\n\u201cIf I were given a chance to have Princess Diana and Audrey Hepburn even just hold my bag, it would be timeless forever. They were also some of my pegs [while I was designing].\u201d\nFor his foremost muse, though, that person comes in the form of his grandmother.&nbsp;\n\u201cMy grandmother, we call her \u2018Nanay,\u2019 is probably one of the most stylish women I\u2019ve ever met. When it comes to style, she always says it has to be timeless.\u201d\nAs for designers, the names that came up were Alexander McQueen, Christian Dior, and Gabrielle \u201cCoco\u201d Chanel.&nbsp;\n\u201c[Gabrielle Chanel] was an amazing fashion rebel because of how she wanted to change how everyone viewed women. During her time, the fashion world was very male-dominated\u2014so let\u2019s just say she was Barbie!\u201d he laughs.&nbsp;\nUplifting fellow artisans\nWith the heights the Neil Felipp brand has achieved so far, it wouldn\u2019t be far-fetched for San Pedro to take all the credit. But to him, credit goes to where it\u2019s due, which means sharing the achievements with the artisans that work with him to craft the handheld masterpieces.&nbsp;\nThe importance of their work had been instilled in him from a young age by his grandfather, the founder of Suarez and Sons jewelers. He had started the business back in the \u201980s, which means San Pedro\u2019s childhood was forged among the artisans he works with now.&nbsp;\nSan Pedro\u2019s line of jewelry\n\u201cThe plateros and the makers were actually my playmates. We\u2019d play chess together all the time,\u201d he says.\nWhen the time came for him to build his own brand, he sought the help of the craftspeople that he grew up with.&nbsp;\n\u201cAt the time, I just wanted to work with the artisans. And I really fell in love with them. They\u2019re more than just artisans, they\u2019re really my family. So I wanted to continue what they were doing, but with a more contemporary take,\u201d he says.&nbsp;\nAside from metal, shell has also become an important part of his craft. Since working with shells wasn\u2019t his expertise, he decided to reach out to the local shell community in Cebu and work with them for his Siren minaudi\u00e8re. This ended up becoming a merging of two communities.&nbsp;\nThe details of the Oceania minaudi\u00e8re\n\u201cWe work with the local community of shell makers because Cebu is known as the center of shell trade in the Philippines. So I wanted to combine these two things, which was then created into the Siren minaudi\u00e8re. Those are two communities in one.\u201d&nbsp;\nHis studio has also served as a home and community for fellow artists and designers from outside of Cebu. The Neil Felipp boutique carries a line of barongs by contemporary Filipi\u00f1ana designer Kelvin Morales. Other artists and brands such as Filip + Inna, Balay ni Atong, Natalya Lagdameo, Adante Leyesa, and Edited Limited have also hosted pop-up shows in Cebu with his help.&nbsp;\nFrom the international attention to helping other artists, San Pedro mostly declines the laurels, though.&nbsp;\n\u201cEverything I do is for the Philippines and Cebu. It\u2019s what I always say. It\u2019s more than just me as the brand. It\u2019s to be a platform for the craft.\u201d\nThe fabulous warmth of Neil Felipp San Pedro\nAt his core, though, San Pedro is a daydreamer who weaves intricate stories together through his craft, resulting in some of the most beautiful pieces of functional jewelry you will ever see. He isn\u2019t one to shirk from attention but share the rewards with the people who made it happen.&nbsp;\nThe passion he feels for his craft is palpable in everything he does\u2014from the tales and materials woven to every piece to the way he interacted with his clients at his recently concluded (and very successful) Rockwell pop-up boutique.&nbsp;\nThe Neil Felipp pop-up space at the Power Plant Mall, which ran during the whole month of October\nHis energetic yet easygoing nature demands attention but does not beg for it. It\u2019s something that his audience\u2014including myself\u2014gives willingly. I once jokingly told him that I\u2019m grateful that he\u2019s a designer, or else I\u2019d be out of a job as a writer. He laughed and told me we all tell stories in different ways.&nbsp;\nFor someone in his orbit, it\u2019s easy to get lost in all the beauty of his creations, but for San Pedro, the focus remains.&nbsp;\n\u201c[My bags are really just] a complement to the woman wearing it. Women are so beautiful\u2014inside and out\u2014so I really wanted to design for you guys, and not the other way around,\u201d he explains&nbsp;\n\u201c[Women] are the masterpiece. You are the art.\u201d\nRead more",

The leaders we elect at the barangay and SK levels are the closest to our communities, and they hold a unique responsibility to address the diverse challenges we face. Among these challenges, perhaps the most pressing in today\u2019s context, is the need for accountability, particularly in public health matters.\nAccountability is a cornerstone of effective governance. Our barangay and SK leaders must be accountable on various fronts. Today, more than ever, health is at the forefront of these concerns. The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the critical role that local leaders play in managing health crises and ensuring the welfare of their constituents. Remember how our barangay officials, tanod, and health workers did house-to-house contact tracing, risk communication, and vaccine advocacy? However, it\u2019s not just the pandemic that demands their attention. Persistent health system problems like maternal and infant mortality, noncommunicable and infectious diseases, teenage pregnancy, and malnutrition continue to afflict our communities.\nTo address these issues, our leaders must be well-equipped with the knowledge and skills required to tackle the root causes of these problems. The Department of the Interior and Local Government, Department of Health, Commission on Population and Development, and National Nutrition Council have a pivotal role in ensuring that these barangay leaders receive the necessary training and support. This should encompass not only health-care knowledge but also the management and leadership skills needed to make a tangible impact on public health.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nMoreover, external resources can be tapped further to enhance the capacity of our barangay and SK leaders. For example, the Zuellig Family Foundation, a nongovernment organization focused on improving health conditions in rural Filipino communities, provides training programs for local government health leaders. Their modules, like those of the barangay health leadership and management program, are invaluable resources that can be shared with partner institutions, enabling a broader dissemination of knowledge and skills.\nAdChoices\nADVERTISING\nFEATURED STORIES\nOPINION\nRoque arrest serves ends of justice\nOPINION\nWe must be the answers\nOPINION\nIs our ICC case dependent on insider witnesses?\nHowever, while these external resources and support systems are available, the first and foremost responsibility lies with us citizens. We have the power to shape our communities and the quality of governance therein. Voting wisely for our barangay and SK leaders is not just a right but a civic duty. Our choices will directly impact the quality of governance at the grassroots level.\nThe BSKE is not just another round of political contest. This is a reflection of our collective commitment to strengthen governance and improve the well-being of our communities. With informed choices and accountability as our watchwords, we can pave the way for a healthier and more prosperous future for all of us.\nDr. Anthony Rosendo\n\u201cTonyboy\u201d Faraon,deputy executive director,\nZuellig Family Foundation\nYour subscription could not be saved.

        "content": "What does it mean to nurture a nation\u2019s mental health?\nIt is one thing to treat an individual. Even traditional notions of public mental health still focus on treating individuals, albeit on a massive scale. It is quite something else to treat a nation\u2019s mental health. This requires stepping back, taking a sober assessment of the nation as a whole, and designing processes toward collective healing.\nTo begin to understand the Philippines of today is to understand our collective trauma. We have had a long history of colonization and occupation that has left us with indelible memories of subjugation and developed in us a cynicism toward a better future. This internalized oppression has led us to hate ourselves and each other in the unquestioned belief that it is better to be anything but Filipino. What else explains the long-standing culture of corruption in this country that has so far gone unchecked? If you love your country and the people in it, you wouldn\u2019t steal, deceive, or hurt them. If you want the country to succeed, you would not bring it to its knees. If we are to engage in collective healing and break the cycle of oppression, we must actively strengthen our nation\u2019s mental health.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nGood collective well-being starts with a clear sense of identity. We must know who we are as Filipinos and what we stand for. This does not mean a narrow or rigid image of the Filipino. We should embrace our diversity and not force ourselves into homogeneity. Knowing who we are means knowing our shared history. What is our relationship with the past? Are we easily swayed by historical revisionism and negationism?

Do we feel ashamed of our country compared to others? Genuine self-esteem is not inflated\u2014our assessment of our worth is grounded in both reality and potential. Let us also not conflate love of country for love of a particular government. We can be critical of our public servants while still loving our country. In fact, demanding accountability from our government can be a way of expressing that our country deserves better.\nThere can be no collective well-being without safety. Not feeling safe or secure is what drives people toward selfishness and away from community-building. When one feels unsafe, everyone else feels like a threat. We label others as enemies and think their destruction will give us peace. Only by cultivating a sense of safety can we begin to trust and care for others. The ability to trust others (with discernment!) is essential to growth and healing.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nDo we feel safe enough to explore outside of our comfort zones? Are we overly afraid of change, to the point of clinging to the familiar even if they are ineffective and destructive? This is one reason why people keep voting the same ineffective and corrupt dynasties: Better the devil they know than the devil they don\u2019t. This mindset betrays a deep sense of hopelessness for our future, the consequence of our chronic oppression. To break this cycle, we must resist the urge to give in to despair and fight for our future. We must nurture a better future by laying a good foundation for our children: quality education, adequate health care, and accessible nutrition. We must invest in long-term infrastructures and projects and not be content with band-aid solutions.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nAll nations go through periods of struggle and hardship. But these all need to be balanced with collective joy and ease. Are we bombarded with bad news or do we experience some wins every now and then? When will our commuters and pedestrians experience an increase in ease during their daily travels? When will our farmers get a reprieve from harsh market conditions?\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nHow we treat each other also matters. Do we listen to each other? Do we take the time and effort to express and communicate ourselves to better each other\u2019s understanding, or do we simply want to drown out other voices? When a national issue comes up, do we engage in dialogue, constructive criticism, and solution-building? Or do we focus on blaming others and making sure we escape from personal responsibility?\nAs mental health month draws to a close, I hope it is clear that the work is far from over\u2014and that the work is worth doing. Cultivating good mental health is a continuous practice that requires both individual and collective efforts. In this way, mental health can be used as our guiding principle or value so that we think, feel, and behave in a way that is truly healing, not only for ourselves but for our community and our country.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\naatuazon@up.edu.ph\nYour subscription could not be saved.

In a remarkable joint effort with the Indian Cultural Association of the Philippines and the Indian Embassy,\nGullas College of Medicine Gala\n&nbsp;\nshowcased traditions, artistry, and heritage from both nations.\nThe gala was nothing short of grandeur. The Gullas College of Medicine, a prestigious institution renowned for its commitment to education, served as the perfect backdrop for the event. As an evening celebrating unity and diversity between both countries, the gala brought together diplomats, politicians, businessmen, and socialites, all dressed in traditional Filipino attire.&nbsp;\nAmong the esteemed attendees was the 1st Secretary of the Indian Embassy, His Excellency Kannan C., and Cebu City Mayor Michael Lopez Rama, whose presence added to the significance of the event, symbolizing the strong commitment to cultural exchange and cooperation between the Philippines and India.&nbsp;\nAnother name worth mentioning was Mr. Shambu S Kumaran, a distinguished diplomat serving as the current Indian Ambassador to the Philippines, Republic of Palau, and Federated States of Micronesia.

The commitment to international-based learning reflects the college\u2019s dedication to providing students with a global perspective, preparing them for a diverse and interconnected healthcare landscape.\nIn addition, the integration of Innovative Science Technology at the core of the college\u2019s curriculum highlights Dr. Pillai\u2019s forward-thinking approach. Embracing cutting-edge technologies ensures that students are not only well-versed in traditional medical practices but also equipped with the latest advancements, setting them apart in the field.\n\u201cEducation knows no boundaries, and our vision for a knowledge city transcends borders, uniting the best of India and the Philippines. Together, we can create a brighter future built on the foundations of collaboration and shared knowledge.\u201d\nWith the evening drawing to a close, the event was successful in celebrating diversity, encouraging collaboration, and promoting innovation that knows no boundaries. An exchange of gifts served as a tangible reminder of the profound connections made during this unforgettable night, leaving all in attendance with hearts full of appreciation and a shared commitment to nurturing the enduring friendship between the Philippines and India.\nADVT.\nRead more stories here:\nBusinesses shift to digital payments in the post-pandemic era\nPepsi celebrates its next era with an unapologetic, bold new look\nSuper-app company outlines strategic commitments to drive economic empowerment in Mindanao\nREAD MORE\nREAD NEXT\nTeodoro: China warship\u2019s \u2018dangerous maneuver\u2019 vs PH ...\nTeodoro says China a \u2018squatter\u2019 in West PH Sea\nEDITORS' PICK\nUAAP Finals: UP's Reyland Torres not suspended for Game 3\nTolentino leads awarding of land titles to 4,029 Bukidnon farmers\nSelena Gomez now engaged to Benny Blanco\nPH men\u2019s football team settles for draw vs Myanmar in Mitsubishi Cup\nFiesta Se\u00f1or 2025: Registration for Fluvial Procession begins\nVP Sara Duterte wrong to say DOJ is 'biased' \u2013 exec\nMOST READ\nTeodoro says petitions to cancel candidacy \u2018political maneuvering\u2019\nSofronio Vasquez looks back on Rey Valera's advice after 'The Voice' US win\n3 persons, including 3-month-old baby, killed in Maguindanao ambush\nPhilHealth\u2019s zero subsidy for 2025 an insult to members \u2013 group\nFollow\n@FMangosingINQ\non Twitter\n-->\nView comments",

        "content": "My trip to Bangued, Abra, last week as the representative of the National Research Council of the Philippines for the Regional Science, Technology, and Innovation Week celebration of the Cordillera Administrative Region was an illuminating experience that showcased the synergy and collaborative spirit within the realm of science and technology.\nThe Cordillera Administrative Region, comprising Abra, Apayao, Benguet, Kalinga, Ifugao, and Mountain Province, served as the backdrop for a three-day event that brought together local government officials, university faculty and researchers, public sector entrepreneurs, and representatives from national government agencies to share insights and foster collaboration.\nThe organizational strength, interoperability, and unity of the Department of Science and Technology (DOST) were evident throughout the event. The presence of key figures such as DOST undersecretary for regional operations Sancho Maborrang and regional director Nancy Bantog, along with the provincial science and technology officers, underscored the commitment to driving progress through science and technology at both regional and provincial levels.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThe highlight of the conference was the awarding of the Best CEST (Community Empowerment Through Science and Technology) Community. Another notable accolade was bestowed upon the best SETUP (Small Enterprise Technology Upgrading Program ) Adoptors.\nFEATURED STORIES\nOPINION\nRoque arrest serves ends of justice\nOPINION\nWe must be the answers\nOPINION\nIs our ICC case dependent on insider witnesses?\nThe enthusiasm of local community-level entrepreneurs for DOST regional outreach assistance projects was palpable. This annual drive has become a catalyst for science and technology-oriented innovation, breathing life into projects that contribute to income and livelihood generation within the community.\nThe meticulously crafted three-day program featured a techno-bazaar showcasing the products of regional and provincial office-assisted enterprises. Field trips to project sites in nearby towns provided participants with firsthand experiences in bamboo-based industries, mushroom culture, free-range chicken farming, and traditional handloom weaving.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nEvenings were dedicated to celebrating the rich cultural tapestry of the region, with cultural shows and a fashion display highlighting creative uses and designs of indigenous and local woven garments. Two days were dedicated to technology presentations, covering topics such as bamboo furniture design and production, bamboo propagation, and the production of bamboo fiber and fabrics. Sessions also addressed challenges and responses to intellectual property issues related to traditional weaves and designs.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThe demonstration of 3D printing emerged as an eye-opener, emphasizing its importance in driving innovation and design in local products. Sessions on good practices and ongoing processes of building smart cities in Tabuk City and Baguio City provided insights into the future of urban development in the region.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nA press conference aimed at broadcasting the highlights and significance of the event via various media channels added a layer of outreach, bringing the achievements and discussions to a wider audience.\nThe event provided ample opportunities for local entrepreneurs, government officials, and faculty and students to engage in meaningful dialogues, addressing specific questions related to their respective fields. It highlighted the thirst and interest of participants. This emphasized the need for more systematic engagement in building a science culture at the community level.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nMy presentation focused on the formulation of a policy to transform municipalities into science cities. This strategic approach aims at fast-tracking and focusing the development and modernization of municipalities and communities that have been historically deprived of full participation in the advances of science and technology and the Internet of Things and digitalization.\nA highlight of the visit was the exploration of the Abra State Institute of Science and Technology, tracing its roots back to a farm school established by American educators in the 1900s. This institution is poised to elevate to a full-fledged University of Abra in the coming months by law, underscoring the critical role of universities in consolidating and developing resources, capabilities, and opportunities for the application of science and technology to solve local problems and promote livelihood.\nThe most significant opportunity I observed was the coherent vision of regional development within the Cordillera region. While currently an administrative region, the unity and shared goals witnessed during the conference hinted at a grander vision of regional development akin to the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao. The 1987 Constitution mandated the autonomy of the Cordilleras, and with the tangible cultural identity and system of the Cordillera region, the prospect of an upgrade should not be far behind. My journey to Bangued not only showcased the advancements in science and technology but also hinted at a future where regional autonomy aligns seamlessly with the region\u2019s rich cultural heritage and developmental aspirations.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013\nYour subscription could not be saved.

Regional outward aggression has taken a backseat to unctuous charm as China sought to win the hearts of more than 40 Asian nations and regions by dazzling them with technology and slathering them with praise. (AP Photo/Ng Han Guan)\nSigns around Hangzhou billed the city as a \u201cparadise on earth\u201d while China adopted the motto \u201cheart to heart\u201d for the Asian Games, which feature some 12,000 competitors \u2013 more than the summer Olympics \u2013 from across Asia and the Middle East.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\n\u201cThis will undoubtedly open new prospects for cultural exchanges, cultural integration and people-to-people bonds in Asia,\u201d the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s official People\u2019s Daily wrote Monday in an effusive editorial about the Hangzhou games. \u201cIt will inject profound and lasting cultural strength into the building of a community with a shared future for mankind.\u201d\nThe headlines the state-run China Daily\u2019s supplement edition for the games carried after the opening ceremony included \u201cXi extends hand of friendship,\u201d and \u201cWave of Glory\u201d alongside a photo of the Chinese leader waving to the crowds.\nXi told the officials at Saturday\u2019s banquet that the region\u2019s recent economic growth had been an \u201cAsian miracle\u201d and that \u201cwe should make Asia an anchor of world peace.\u201d\nBut while offering a verbal carrot in Hangzhou, Beijing continued brandishing a physical stick elsewhere. Taiwan\u2019s military said Sunday it had detected the Chinese military initiating an exercise featuring warplanes, ships and ground troops in coastal Fujian Province, which faces Taiwan.\nThe Philippine coast guard reported over the weekend that it had detected a floating barrier placed by China\u2019s coast guard to prevent Filipino fishing boats from entering a lagoon in a disputed shoal in the South China Sea.\nThe Philippines removed the barrier on Monday. Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Wang Wenbin told reporters Tuesday that China\u2019s \u201cresolve to safeguard its sovereignty and maritime rights\u201d was unwavering, and he warned \u201cthe Philippines not to make provocations or seek trouble.\u201d\nXi\u2019s banquet speech did not refer to any territorial claims or confrontations, nor to the mounting tensions with the U.S. and its allies as Beijing and Washington jockey for influence in the Asia-Pacific region\nStill, geopolitics were clearly not far from his Xi\u2019s mind as he outlined China\u2019s goals, thinly veiling his remarks with the language of sport.\n\u201cAs a community with a shared future connected by mountains and rivers as well as cultural affinity, we should use sports to promote peace, pursue good neighborliness and mutual benefit, and reject Cold War mentality and bloc confrontation,\u201d he said, using language China commonly does when referring to the U.S.\u2019s Asia-Pacific strategy.\nYour subscription could not be saved.
