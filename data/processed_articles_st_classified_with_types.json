        "content": "ROME  -     Italy has officially informed China that it is quitting the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), dismissing fears the move might sour relations and damage the Italian economy, government sources said on Wednesday.\nItaly in 2019 became the first and so far only major Western nation to join the trade and investment programme, ignoring warnings from the United States that it might let China take control of sensitive technologies and vital infrastructure.\nHowever, when Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni took office last year, she said she wanted to withdraw from the deal, which was championed by President Xi Jinping, saying it had brought no significant gains to Italy.\nThe 2019 accord expires in March 2024 and an Italian government source said Rome had sent Beijing a letter \"in recent days\" informing China that it would not be renewing the pact.\nThere was no immediate comment from China.\n\"We have every intention of maintaining excellent relations with China even if we are no longer part of the Belt and Road Initiative,\" a second government source said.\n\"Other G7 nations have closer relations with China than we do, despite the fact they were never in (the BRI),\" he added.\nST Asian Insider: Malaysia Edition\nGet exclusive insights into Malaysia in weekly round-up\nThank you!\nSign up\nBy signing up, I accept SPH Media's\nTerms &amp; Conditions\nand\nPrivacy Policy\nas amended from time to time.\nYes, I would also like to receive SPH Media Group's\nSPH Media Limited, its related corporations and affiliates as well as their agents and authorised service providers.\nmarketing and promotions.\nItaly will assume the presidency of the G7 in 2024.\nMore than 100 countries have signed agreements with China to cooperate on BRI infrastructure and building projects since the scheme was launched in 2013. The then Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte hoped for a trade bonanza when he signed up in 2019, but Chinese firms seemed to be the main beneficiaries.\nItalian exports to China totalled 16.4 billion euros ($17.7 billion) last year from 13 billion euros in 2019. By contrast, Chinese exports to Italy rose to 57.5 billion from 31.7 billion over the same period, according to Italian data.\nItaly's main euro zone trading partners France and Germany exported significantly more to China last year, despite not being part of the BRI, which is modelled on the old Silk Road that linked China to the West.\nLooking to maintain strategic ties, Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani visited Beijing in September and President Sergio Mattarella is due to visit China at some stage next year.\nMeloni herself has said she wants to go to Beijing, but no date has been fixed.\nDespite being part of the BRI, successive governments in Rome signalled their doubts about the pact by vetoing some proposed takeovers or limiting the sway of Chinese companies over their Italian counterparts.\nIn June, Meloni's cabinet curbed the influence of Chinese shareholder Sinochem on Italian tyremaker Pirelli, using \"golden power\" rules designed to protect strategic assets.\nMeloni, who heads a conservative coalition, has been keen to burnish her credentials as a committed pro-NATO leader and a government source said that she had assured U.S. President Joe Biden earlier this year that Italy would quit the BRI.

The Chinese government introduced this global infrastructure development scheme in 2013 to invest in countries and international organisations.\nMs Iris Lanfen Wei, director of the NCPA\u2019s department of production and artistic administration, tells The Straits Times: \u201cNCPA has always emphasised both Chinese original creations and world classics in its repertoire production.\n\u201cOn the one hand, it develops and promotes Chinese culture, especially traditional culture. On the other hand, it also actively introduces world classics.\u201d\nGianni Schicchi is the only opera buffa composed by opera&nbsp;master Puccini.&nbsp;\nThe comic opera in one act, about a witty fight for a family\u2019s fortune, was an immediate hit when it was first performed&nbsp;at New York\u2019s Metropolitan Opera&nbsp;in December 1918.&nbsp;\nIt garnered rave reviews&nbsp;and the score has been praised for its creativity and imagination.&nbsp;The aria,&nbsp;O Mio Babbino Caro (\u201cO My Dear Daddy\u201d), is one of the most famous lyric soprano arias in opera.&nbsp;\nNCPA first performed the work&nbsp;in China in 2021, following its productions of other famous works such as Turandot, Tosca and La Fanciulla del West by the same composer.&nbsp;\nA Story Of Growing Up is based on a 1956 fairy tale by Ren Rongrong, a famous Chinese&nbsp;translator and writer of children\u2019s literature.\nThe production with bright and breezy music tells the story of two boys with bad habits \u2013&nbsp;Meitounao (\u201cFool\u201d) and Bugaoxing (\u201cUnhappy\u201d). After&nbsp;a dreamlike trip through time, they finally understand that their foibles could result in terrible mistakes.\nThough different in culture and background, both shows&nbsp;are full of humour and vitality.\nThe NCPA, inaugurated in December 2007, is a state-level art institution in Beijing whose facilities include an opera house, a concert hall, a theatre and an art museum.&nbsp;\nSince NCPA produced its first opera Turandot in 2008, it has put on more than 100 productions, covering opera, drama, dance drama, Peking opera and other\ngenres.&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\nMs Wei says of the double-bill programme for Singapore: \u201cWith his distinctive personal style and highly mature opera-writing techniques, Puccini presented a portrait of Italian society.&nbsp;As for the children\u2019s opera,&nbsp;A Story\nOf\nGrowing Up, it has not only become a classic in the history of children\u2019s literature, but also a common childhood memory for generations.\n\u201cWe hope that these two representative works can leave a deep impression on Singaporean audiences.\u201d\nMaestro\nYeh\n, who is also Singapore Chinese Orchestra\u2019s conductor emeritus, says: \u201cThough these two operas are shorter in length and lighter in style, they show important aspects of human nature with a good sense of humour.\u201d &nbsp;\nA Story Of Growing Up is a lively and witty production adapted from a fairy tale of the same title.\nPHOTO: CHINA NATIONAL CENTRE FOR THE PERFORMING ARTS\nBook It/Puccini Opera Gianni Schicchi\nWhere:\n&nbsp;Singtel Waterfront Theatre\n,&nbsp;Esplanade \u2013 Theatres on the Bay, 8 Raffles Avenue\nWhen:\nDec 8, 7.30pm\nAdmission:\n$58, $78\nInfo:\nThe performance\nis in Italian, with surtitles in English and Chinese.

Moscow says this does not mean a military alliance, however.\nShared outlook\nBoth leaders share a broad world view, which sees the West as decadent and in decline just as China challenges US supremacy in everything from technology to espionage and military power.\nTrade between Russia and China soared 30 per cent in the first half of this year and will rise to more than US$200 billion (S$272 billion) in 2023, Russian Economy Minister Maxim Reshetnikov said on a visit to China.\n\u201cWe are actively developing investments, including in our large gas and petrochemical projects, where we actively use Chinese technologies,\u201d Mr Reshetnikov said.\n\u201cWe are strongly interested in transforming technological cooperation into investment cooperation, so that Chinese companies actively enter into these projects, invest in capital, and lend money, because the projects are capital-intensive and not all of them can be fully provided for by the Russian financial system.\u201d\nThe United States sees China as its gravest long-term \u201cstrategic competitor\u201d and Russia as an \u201cacute threat\u201d.\nChina has refrained from condemning Russia\u2019s operation against Ukraine or calling it an invasion, in line with the Kremlin, which casts the war as a \u201cspecial military operation\u201d.\nEarlier this year, CIA Director William Burns said Russia was becoming more and more dependent on China and was even at risk of becoming its \u201ceconomic colony\u201d in time.

        "content": "BRASILIA  -     Since he returned to office in January, Brazil's President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has traveled to 21 countries and met with more than 50 heads of state, including two kings and the Pope.\nThe globe-trotting leftist leader, the first head of state to address the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday, has prioritized foreign trips in his third term so far, as he strives to restore his country as a global player.\n\"Brazil is back,\" he repeats in speeches across five continents, in contrast with the growing isolation that came with his predecessor Jair Bolsonaro's hard-right political stance and dismal environmental record.\nBut diplomats and foreign policy experts say Lula is far from restoring the \"soft power\" status Brazil enjoyed after his first two terms, from 2003 to 2010, when the country became a voice for the rising global south while remaining independent from both the U.S. and China.\nIn part, that reflects the choppier waters the 77-year-old Brazilian leader now navigates, as Beijing and Washington flirt with a new Cold War while war rages in Ukraine. Brazil has also become increasingly dependent on Asian markets, which buy half of its exports. China alone, Brazil's main trading partner, buys 37% of its farm exports.\n\"This is a very tricky balancing act and Lula so far has not been able to find the right equilibrium,\" said Oliver Stuenkel, an associate professor of international relations at the FGV think tank in Sao Paulo. \"There is a perception in Brazilian society now that he is tilting towards the Sino-Russian axis more than the West.\"\nOn Wednesday, Lula is scheduled to meet U.S. President Joe Biden to discuss the climate crisis on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly, focusing where the Brazilian leader has shined.\nST Asian Insider: Malaysia Edition\nGet exclusive insights into Malaysia in weekly round-up\nThank you!\nSign up\nBy signing up, I accept SPH Media's\nTerms &amp; Conditions\nand\nPrivacy Policy\nas amended from time to time.\nYes, I would also like to receive SPH Media Group's\nSPH Media Limited, its related corporations and affiliates as well as their agents and authorised service providers.\nmarketing and promotions.\nLula has helped to restore Brazil's central role in climate diplomacy, leading a regional rainforest summit, drawing global contributions to protect the Amazon and overhauling policies to bring down deforestation sharply.\nEven before he took office, Lula was greeted like a rock star last November at the U.N. climate change conference in Egypt. His polices have helped to nearly halve deforestation of the Brazilian Amazon through August, compared to the first eight months of last year, rebuilding Brazil's credibility for climate talks.\nBut his comments about the war in Ukraine - he has said both sides are responsible for the conflict as he sought to broker a peace deal - have angered U.S. and European allies, who have accused him of parroting Russian rhetoric.\nLula's penchant for off-the cuff remarks have occasionally made matters worse.\nDuring a G20 meeting in India this month, he said there was \"no way\"&nbsp;Russian President Vladimir Putin would be arrested if he attended next year's summit in Rio de Janeiro. When reporters probed him on Brazil's commitments to enforce an arrest warrant issued by the International Criminal Court, he rowed back his comments but suggested Brazil could leave the ICC.\n\"There have been some bruising moments. The whole Russia -Ukraine issue was a lesson learned,\" said Thomas Shannon, a former U.S. ambassador to Brazil who is now senior international policy advisor at Arnold &amp;amp; Porter.\nAt last month's BRICS summit in South Africa, where the group of leading emerging economies expanded its membership as China called for, Brazil got Chinese backing for a permanent U.N. Security Council seat it wants. But that is unlikely to happen any time soon, according to Shannon.\nThe closer ties to Beijing could complicate Brazil's relationship with Washington, including access to key technology, Shannon added.\n'OUTDATED AGENDA'\nCloser to home, Lula has reaped little in concrete terms from Latin America's broad left-of-center alignment. The Mercosur trade bloc took nearly half a year to respond formally to a new European position on a trade deal now on the ropes.\nAnd Lula's longstanding sympathies with leftist governments in Nicaragua and Venezuela accused of human rights abuses have him looking out of step with a new generation of progressive Latin American leaders.\nLula rolled out the red carpet for Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro in Brasilia at a regional summit in May, helping to bring the socialist leader out of isolation. Other leaders, including Chile's leftist President Gabriel Boric, criticized Maduro's presence.\nImpressions of ideological bias may hurt Brazil's image as the country returns to the international spotlight, putting Lula at odds sometimes with his Foreign Ministry, said Rubens Barbosa, a former Brazilian ambassador to London and Washington.\n\"Where is Brazil the defender of human rights? It's not clear what Brazil stands for today when it picks Putin and Maduro as allies,\" said a South American ambassador in Brasilia, who asked not to be identified.\n\"Brazil is rapidly wasting its soft power by trying to be an international player with an outdated agenda,\" he said.

Since then, Xi and Putin have deepened relations.\nXi and Putin believe the U.S-dominated post-Cold War era is crumbling. The U.S. casts China as its biggest competitor and Russia as its biggest nation-state threat. U.S. President Joe Biden says this century will be defined by an existential contest between democracies and autocracies.\nAt last year's virtual summit, the group criticised what it called the negative impact of \"unilateral and unlimited expansion of global missile defence systems by certain countries or groups of countries\", without directly referring to NATO expansion or Western military assistance to Ukraine.\nIn a move that highlighted Beijing's pragmatic economy- driven approach, Xi presided over a ceremony on Wednesday with his Kazakh counterpart just hours before meeting Putin, to mark the departure of a fresh batch of cargo along the Trans-Caspian International Transport Route.\nThe route, also known as the Middle Corridor, starts in southeast Asia and China, runs through Kazakhstan, the Caspian Sea, Azerbaijan, Georgia and further to Europe. It has been heavily promoted by the West as an alternative to Asia-Europe land transit via Russia.\nBelarus will attend the Astana summit for the first time as a full member of the SCO, the Kremlin said.

        "content": "Hong Kong\n\u2013\nTen years ago almost to the day, while checking out a handful of luxury sedans from one of China\u2019s largest automakers, SAIC Motor, President Xi Jinping gave a pivotal speech that would set China on the course to dominate the electric vehicle (EV) industry.\nThe path to becoming a strong automaking nation lies in developing new energy vehicles, Mr Xi said, according to a Xinhua report in 2014. Claiming a head start, or \u201chigh ground\u201d, in this sector is key to the global competition, he said.\nIn 2014, China sold around 75,000 EVs and hybrids, and exported about 533,000 cars. The domestic market was dominated by international manufacturers such as Volkswagen and General Motors, which were allowed to enter by forming joint ventures with local players in the 1980s and 1990s.\nThis helped China transform from a bike-riding nation to a car-driving one. Home-grown carmakers and brands that did not work with foreign partners were seen as inferior and lagging behind in engine and other automotive technologies.\nTo get ahead and tackle environmental challenges, Beijing bet on fuel-efficient and alternative energy vehicles. The state had published a guideline in 2012 that established ways to develop the industry by setting sales goals, providing subsidies and allocating resources for building EV charging infrastructure, among other things.\nMr Xi\u2019s speech two years later signalled China\u2019s determination to use this as a way to leapfrog traditional Western and Asian auto powerhouses, in particular Japan, home to Toyota Motor.\nWith the stage set, China needed a catalyst to spur consumer interest in EVs, which in the early 2010s were mostly cheap cars with short ranges. That ended up being Tesla, which became the first foreign automaker to set up a wholly owned operation in China.\nGet tips to boost your career, money and lifestyle\nThank you!\nSign up\nBy signing up, I accept SPH Media's\nTerms &amp; Conditions\nand\nPrivacy Policy\nas amended from time to time.\nYes, I would also like to receive SPH Media Group's\nSPH Media Limited, its related corporations and affiliates as well as their agents and authorised service providers.\nmarketing and promotions.\nWith that special permission, Tesla completed its Shanghai factory in 2019. Its entry into the market motivated local players to come up with better EVs with longer ranges.\nFast-forward to 2024, China has become the world\u2019s largest auto market and sells more electrified vehicles than any other country, with 9.5 million cars delivered\nin 2023\n. It also controls the majority of the battery supply chain.\nHome-grown champion BYD dethroned Volkswagen to become the best-selling brand in China and, in the last quarter of 2023, surpassed Tesla as the world\u2019s largest producer of EVs. China also overtook Japan as the largest auto exporter, sending 4.14 million units abroad, with 1.55 million of them being EVs or plug-in hybrids.\nThe achievements prove that\nBeijing\u2019s industrial policy and investments have paid off. But they are also adding to tensions with the West. China\u2019s success in EVs, which could disrupt traditional auto supply chains that employ millions of people, has become a key source of discomfort in Washington and Brussels.\nAs a price war at home and slowing growth drive Chinese automakers to search for buyers for its affordable and tech-laden EVs elsewhere, they are running into trade barriers, especially in the European Union and the US, which are meanwhile trying to develop their own EV supply chains. Both have accused China of exporting its excess capacity.\nThe US has quadrupled import tariffs on Chinese cars to more than 100 per cent, while the EU is investigating Chinese EVs to see if there has been an unfair advantage from government subsidies.\nBrazil recently removed a tax break on imported EVs and even Russia, arguably Beijing\u2019s strongest ally and the largest destination for Chinese auto exports since the war with Ukraine, has asked Chinese carmakers to consider localising production.\nBeijing has threatened to hit back, with the China Chamber of Commerce to the EU saying on May 22 that the import tariffs on cars with large engines may be raised to 25 per cent from 15 per cent. There is a June 5 deadline for the EU to inform Chinese EV exporters of preliminary findings and whether tariffs will be imposed.\nSAIC\n, the state-owned manufacturer whose facility Mr Xi visited 10 years ago,\nhappens to be one of three Chinese automakers, along with BYD and Zhejiang Geely Holding Group, selected for further scrutiny by the EU in its anti-subsidy investigation. SAIC owns British-origin MG, which is one of the top-selling EV brands in Europe.\nAt an event on\nMay 24\nmarking the 10th anniversary of Mr Xi\u2019s speech, SAIC officials, including chief engineer Zu Sijie, said they have remembered the President\u2019s instructions well, and the company has consistently innovated around technologies like smart driving and connected cars.\nMr Li Zheng, co-founder of SAIC Qingtao New Energy Technology, a battery start-up backed by SAIC, took the opportunity to promise that executives will not be complacent\nas EV competition rises\n, noting that progress in solid-state batteries, which have a higher energy density and reduced fire risk, will be one way for China to maintain its edge.\n\u201cNew energy vehicles have become a strategic industry, fiercely contested by countries around the world,\u201d Mr Li said. \u201cThey\u2019re a key supporting force to our country\u2019s revitalisation of green sectors.\u201d\nA lot can happen in 10 years, but with SAIC having invested about 150 billion yuan (S$28.5 billion) in research and development over the past decade alone, even despite trade wars, 2034 looks bright.\nBLOOMBERG\nMore on this Topic\nChina EV makers taking longer to pay bills amid rising stress\n\u2018Bloodbath looms\u2019 in China\u2019s overcrowded EV industry\nAlready a subscriber?&nbsp;\nLog in\nOur 12.12 Sale is here!\nStay informed with ST One Digital at $0.99/month for the first 6 months\nST One Digital Plan\n$9.90/month\n&nbsp;\n$0.99/month\nNo contract\nBilled at $0.99/month for the first 6 months, $9.90/month thereafter.

Rome will also propose creating a steering committee to ensure greater G7 coordination on AI.\nThe source said G7 leaders were \"pretty much on the same page\" over AI, adding that there was broad consensus on most of the major issues facing the wealthy-nation club, including on how to deal with China.\nThere was a determination on all sides to avoid tensions with Beijing, the source said, adding: \"Nobody wants to impede or put obstacles towards Chinese growth.\"\nThere was also agreement, the source said, on the need to develop economies in Africa and try to stem illegal immigration - a domestic priority for Meloni, who is struggling to honour an 2022 election pledge to stem migrant flows.
