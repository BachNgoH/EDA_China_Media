The event was attended by notable dignitaries, including Ho Iat Seng, chief executive of the Macao Special Administrative Region; Pansy Ho, chairperson and executive director of MGM China Holdings Limited; and Liu Hualong, chairman of Poly Group Corporation.\nThe museum is a response to Macau's growing prominence as a centre for cultural tourism, leveraging its historical role as a vital node on the Maritime Silk Road. Both Poly Culture and MGM view the museum as a bridge between China and the world, blending Chinese traditions with modern perspectives. Liu highlighted this partnership as an extension of the Greater Bay Area initiative, which emphasises collaboration and cultural preservation.

Designed to the exacting standards required for exhibiting Grade-One cultural relics, the museum employs cutting-edge environmental regulation technologies to ensure the preservation of its priceless artefacts. Its architectural design combines traditional Chinese craftsmanship with contemporary aesthetics, offering visitors a blend of heritage and innovation.\nRELATED\nthailand\nONESIAM SuperApp Elevates Shopping with Exclusive Member Rewards\nworld\nDriver kills 35 pedestrians in Chinese city\nThe museum was conceived not only as a repository of relics but as a vibrant cultural platform. Its goal is to educate, inspire and engage audiences through immersive experiences. By integrating advanced technology with traditional narratives, the museum seeks to create a multi-sensory environment that appeals to visitors of all ages and backgrounds.\nThe Maritime Silk Road: A Journey Through Time\nThe museum's inaugural exhibition, \"The Maritime Silk Road: Discover The Mystical Seas And Encounter The Treasures Of The Ancient Trade Route\", reflects its mission to explore historical connections and foster cross-cultural understanding. Featuring 184 sets of artefacts totalling 228 individual pieces, the exhibition showcases contributions from nearly 20 national museums. Among its highlights are 30 Grade-One relics, including the celebrated Bronze Zodiac Heads from the Old Summer Palace, which underscore China's rich cultural legacy.\nThe exhibition is divided into four thematic sections: Monsoon, Cultural Origin, Integration and Connections. Together, they trace the history, development and enduring significance of the Maritime Silk Road as a cultural and economic network that shaped civilisations.\n- Monsoon: Navigating the Seas\nThe journey begins with an exploration of humanity's relationship with the ocean, charting the evolution of maritime technology and navigation. This section showcases ancient maps, ship models and artefacts that highlight the ingenuity of early seafarers. Visitors are guided through the Age of Discovery, learning about the pivotal role of the Maritime Silk Road in connecting continents and fostering trade.\n- Cultural Origin: Treasures Beneath the Waves\nThe second section focuses on underwater archaeology, revealing the mysteries of ancient shipwrecks and salvaged treasures. Artefacts such as porcelain, coins and tools tell the story of China's flourishing maritime trade. This chapter also highlights the importance of key ports and the artisans who created the exquisite goods that became coveted commodities along the route.\n- Integration: Bridging Cultures\nThis section celebrates the cultural exchanges facilitated by the Maritime Silk Road. Trade goods such as silk, spices and ceramics serve as tangible evidence of the connections between East and West. Stories of merchants, envoys and travellers illustrate how these exchanges shaped art, cuisine and daily life across the globe. The exhibits emphasise the profound influence of these interactions on modern globalisation.\n- Connections: Charting the Future\nThe exhibition concludes with a forward-looking perspective, exploring themes of marine conservation, cultural preservation and the Belt and Road Initiative. Multimedia installations, including documentaries and artistic interpretations, underscore the continued relevance of the Maritime Silk Road. This chapter invites visitors to consider how historical lessons can inform a more interconnected and sustainable future.\nA Landmark for Macau\nThe Poly MGM Museum is a significant addition to Macau's cultural offerings, reinforcing its position as a global centre for cultural tourism. Macau's unique history as a gateway between China and the West makes it an ideal location for this institution, which seeks to preserve the past while inspiring future generations.\nThe museum's debut exhibition exemplifies this mission by blending historical artefacts with modern narratives. Visitors are not only immersed in the rich heritage of the Maritime Silk Road but also invited to reflect on its enduring impact. The combination of ancient treasures and contemporary art creates a dialogue that transcends time and space, making the museum an engaging and educational experience for all. Beyond its exhibitions, the Poly MGM Museum serves as a symbol of Macau's broader ambitions. By hosting world-class cultural events and fostering collaborations with international institutions, the museum positions Macau as a vibrant hub for cultural dialogue. Its innovative approach to storytelling ensures that it resonates with a diverse audience, from local residents to global visitors.\nBridging Heritage and Innovation\nThe Poly MGM Museum stands at the crossroads of tradition and modernity, embodying a commitment to preserving cultural heritage while embracing the possibilities of the future. Its state-of-the-art facilities and carefully curated exhibitions set a new standard for museums in the region. More than a space for historical artefacts, it is a dynamic venue for education, inspiration and exchange.

It offers a unique platform for exploring the connections between past and present, fostering a deeper understanding of the shared history that binds humanity.\nWith its inaugural exhibition celebrating the legacy of the Maritime Silk Road, the Poly MGM Museum invites visitors to embark on a journey through time, exploring the beauty of Chinese heritage and its influence on the world.

This scenario would be disastrous for US citizens, businesses, and allies. Given America's record high debt and unsustainable spending, reduced demand for dollar assets would cripple the US economy. The government would be forced to cut public services and military expenditures, altering almost every facet of American life -- and not for the better.\nWorse, the Communist Party of China would control global payments systems and other financial infrastructure. This would allow the CPC to exert its influence and export its surveillance state around the world and isolate the US and its allies with a wall of sanctions. If an American individual or business were to criticise China's leaders, they could be cut off immediately from global commerce.\nThe CPC is trying to make this a reality. In conjunction with its Belt and Road Initiative, which has massively expanded Chinese influence by providing funding for large infrastructure and technology projects in emerging and developing economies, China is devoting significant resources to creating an alternative to the dollar payments system. In 2021, the Chinese government took an important step in this direction with the launch of a central bank digital currency (CBDC).\nADVERTISEMENT\nTo extend the reach of the digital renminbi, the People's Bank of China (PBOC) is spearheading efforts to create a platform for instantaneous cross-border settlement. The mBridge project, short for \"multiple CBDC bridge\" and developed in partnership with a handful of other central banks, seeks to connect commercial banks, businesses, and monetary authorities to a distributed network for trade and financial flows. Many Western central banks, including the European Central Bank and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, as well as the World Bank and commercial banks, have joined the project as observers, but wield little influence over its design and technical details.\nRELATED\nlife\nNew releases for your streaming pleasure: Dec 18-24\nbusiness\nCommerce minister downplays Trump impact, eyes exceeding 2025 export growth target\nIf successful, mBridge would buttress China's currency power play. Worryingly, there are early signs that this strategy is bearing fruit. In April, data from SWIFT, the Brussels-based interbank-payments network, showed the renminbi's share of international payments at an all-time high, overtaking the yen to become the fourth most used currency in cross-border transactions. Although the renminbi has a long way to go before it can credibly threaten the dollar, mBridge will only accelerate this trend.\nThe dollar has reigned supreme for nearly a century because it is backed by a well-established rule of law, a large and powerful military, and a dynamic economy. But US policymakers cannot afford to sit idly while the world changes. Pound sterling was once the dominant currency for international trade and foreign reserves -- until it wasn't. If the greenback is to avoid the same fate, American leaders must recognise that the US financial system is in dire need of updating. As our lives and economies become increasingly digitalised, so, too, must the dollar.\nThe main challenge for US officials is to update the global financial architecture in a way that ensures the dollar's continued use as an instrument for promoting economic freedom globally. The solution lies in a central pillar of American soft power: technological innovation. In other words, a payments system built by private industry in the US is better than one built by the PBOC using Chinese technology. In addition to getting America's fiscal house in order, policymakers should support entrepreneurs issuing stablecoins on blockchain rails.\nStablecoins -- nearly all of which are backed by dollars -- can ensure demand for US government debt while boosting the global standing of the greenback and extending its reach to new digital platforms that empower users and protect individual privacy and sovereignty. But to encourage their uptake, policymakers must create a tailored regulatory framework that provides both issuers and holders with some degree of legal certainty and promotes further innovation.\nThe dollar payments system is under attack. Given what is at stake, protecting its future must become a national-security imperative.\n\u00a92024 Project Syndicate\nPaul Ryan, a former speaker of the US House of Representatives (2015-19), is a visiting fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and a member of the Paradigm Policy Council.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat is your budget range for purchasing a house in Thailand?\nUnder 3 million THB\n3 million - 5 million THB\n5 million - 8 million THB\n8 million - 12 million THB\nOver 12 million THB\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nDollar\nCurrency\nDigital\nDo you like the content of this article?\n5\n13\nCOMMENT\n(1)",

(Photo: Reuters)\nYANGON - Chinese Premier Li Qiang pledged to support Myanmar\u2019s government during a rare sit-down with junta chief Min Aung Hlaing, a sign Beijing is seeking to stabilise a regime losing ground in a worsening civil conflict.\n\"China supports Myanmar in advancing the political reconciliation and transformation,\" Li said during the meeting Wednesday in Kunming, in southwestern China, according to the official\nXinhua News Agency\n. Beijing also \"stands ready to work with Myanmar\" to advance its interests in the country, Li said, including via an economic corridor and projects under the Belt and Road infrastructure initiative.\nMin Aung Hlaing pledged to protect interests of China during the talks, Myanmar\u2019s ruling State Administration Council said in a statement. Both leaders also discussed the resumption of border trade, which has been suspended due to intensifying clashes.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe junta leader was making his first official visit to China since his forces toppled the government in a coup in 2021, arresting its civilian leadership, including pro-democracy figure Aung San Suu Kyi.

It\u2019s unclear who carried out the attack, and Beijing demanded an inquiry. The incident underscored the challenges China faces in balancing its relationships with the junta and ethnic groups, with whom the Chinese also have considerable influence.&nbsp;\nEarlier this week, pro-democracy forces and some ethnic groups criticised China for hosting Min Aung Hlaing, and said attempts to pressure them into ending the fighting would fail.\nIn addition to its losses in the north, recent reports show the junta is on the verge of being expelled from the western-most state bordering Bangladesh.

Quantum computers, soon to compute 47 years faster than today's supercomputers, are nearly a reality. ChatGPT, once a novelty, has seamlessly integrated into daily life. Drones now traverse the skies, delivering food, medicine, and disaster relief to the most remote corners of the globe.\nSatellites illuminate Himalayan villages with internet connectivity. Meanwhile, digital technologies have given rise to breakthroughs in biotechnology, robotics, nanotechnology, environmental science, and medical research, heralding transformative solutions for humanity and our planet. Indeed, the sky is no longer the limit.\nYet, amid these marvels, a stark reality casts a shadow. The United Nations, striving to achieve the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030, finds itself lamentably behind schedule. Despite our technological strides, progress remains frustratingly sluggish, particularly in the Asia-Pacific, where climate action is alarmingly retrogressing.\nADVERTISEMENT\n00:00\n/\n00:11\nBeloved dog evacuated like a princess\nTruvid\nRead Article\nDigital technologies offer a lifeline. They hold the promise of being transformative in achieving the SDGs, especially for women entrepreneurs and youth, fostering inclusivity. However, to unlock this immense potential, we must first ensure robust connectivity, cultivate requisite skills, enact appropriate legislation, and secure financing.\nRELATED\nthailand\nThe First EDRA Examination and Continuing the Training Program in Regional Anesthesia\nthailand\nMyanmar will free arrested fishermen on Jan 4, says Thai defence minister\nConnectivity is key and critical to inclusive and sustainable development, especially among LDCs, LLDCs and SIDS. Persistent power shortages and unstable grids, especially in rural areas, hinder necessary infrastructure. In 2023, some 33% of the global population remained offline, with 73% of these individuals in low-income countries, according to ITU statistics.\nThe high cost of digital devices further widens this gap. Equally critical is the development of digital skills. Large parts of the population in developing nations, particularly in the least developed countries of the Asia-Pacific, lack the skills to engage with the digital economy. This deficit is exacerbated by poor-quality education, especially in rural areas.\nThe legal and regulatory environment is indispensable. Many Asia-Pacific countries lack overarching e-commerce regulations, leaving significant gaps in areas such as online contracts, e-signatures, consumer protection, cybersecurity, taxation, and data privacy. Only 37% of small island developing states and 48% of least developed countries have enacted data protection laws. Financing is another critical piece. Access to capital, especially for women and youth entrepreneurs, is vital for digital sector growth. Around 40% of SMEs in developing countries face a US$5 trillion financing gap, with women-owned businesses receiving just 3% of venture capital funding.\nThe international community's role in galvanising digital transformation in the Asia-Pacific is pivotal. While initiatives like Aid for Trade have seen an uptick in ICT-related commitments -- rising from $1.5 billion (51.9 billion baht) in 2019 to $2.2 billion in 2021 -- these investments account for a mere 4.1% of total allocations. There is a pressing demand for substantially increased financial backing.\nEffective reform hinges on collaboration among national governments, the private sector and other stakeholders, and development partners. Digital technologies are pivotal in addressing SDG challenges in the Asia-Pacific. In India, drones delivering medical supplies to remote areas drastically improve health outcomes by ensuring timely access to essential medicines and vaccines. In the Philippines, telemedicine bridges healthcare gaps, connecting underserved patients with professionals. Satellite technology in Indonesia revolutionises education by bringing internet access to rural communities, enabling virtual classrooms and remote learning, and equipping youth with essential skills.\nMoreover, digital platforms can spur economic growth by fostering digital entrepreneurship and e-commerce, empowering small businesses, particularly those owned by women and youth, to expand their reach and stimulate economic development. Biotechnology innovations strengthen food security by developing resilient crops, while precision agriculture boosts yield and reduces waste. Environmental monitoring provides critical data, helping governments track deforestation, monitor pollution, and predict natural disasters.\nAdditionally, digital payment systems and mobile banking enhance financial inclusion, offering underserved populations access to essential financial services. This empowers individuals, especially women, to save, invest, and build businesses, contributing to poverty reduction and economic stability.\nWe stand amidst a digital revolution where the urgency for decisive, unified action has never been greater. To tackle the formidable challenges ahead, we must leverage our collective knowledge, skills, and expertise. The international community must rise to the occasion, ensuring that no one is left behind. By prioritising connectivity, skill development, robust legislation, and sustainable financing, we can unlock the transformative potential of digital technologies. Though our future may be precarious, it holds the promise of a more inclusive and sustainable world -- if we unite in a global endeavour to embrace this digital metamorphosis.\nThe time for rhetoric has passed; now, we must escalate our global commitment to ensure the dividends of digital progress are shared by all, leaving no region or community in the shadows. The moment to act is now to ensure the benefits of this digital era reach everyone, everywhere.\nAtsuko Okuda is Regional Director, ITU Regional Office for Asia and the Pacific, ITU.

(Photos courtesy of bring the elephant home)\nFor Thanasit Phibunwattanakon, elephants are not just mere animals. For him, they are a unique species -- intelligent and powerful, and they can solve problems.\n\"They bring job opportunities, tourism and income to my community, and we cooperate and work together because of elephants,\" said Thanasit.\nFor Samorn Sangthong, elephants have the right to live on this planet without anyone harming them.\nADVERTISEMENT\n\"Everything is evolving. Humans are evolving, and elephants are evolving. But their living space is still the same size. We need to adjust our way of thinking. We need to adapt and learn to live with elephants,\" she said.\nThanasit and Samorn are two community members of Bring The Elephant Home (BTEH). This year, BTEH celebrates two decades of conservation efforts focused on forging a future where both humans and elephants thrive, benefiting from coexistence. What began with a single encounter with a begging elephant on the streets of Bangkok evolved into a mission to safeguard Thailand's national animal, while empowering communities that share landscapes with wildlife.\nSince its official founding on Nov 12, 2004, BTEH has grown into an international movement rooted in collaboration, innovation and a commitment to sustainability.\nAccording to the founder and director Antoinette van de Water, BTEH's long-term vision emphasises the importance of connected landscapes where elephants can roam freely along ecological corridors, guided by matriarchs who lead herds with wisdom and care.\n\"These are the same values we must embody. Managing resources with care and embracing coexistence as a way of life. Most of all, I dream of a global community united in the belief that we can share this planet in a just and sustainable way,\" she explained.\nVan de Water received a PhD in biological science last year from University of KwaZulu-Natal in South Africa where she worked on elephant conservation policy development.\nBTEH's journey began with small-scale reforestation projects to restore elephant habitats. Since then, the organisation has planted more than 700,000 trees, providing food and habitat for elephants and transforming degraded areas into thriving ecosystems. Seeing communities coordinating these efforts was a turning point. BTEH embarked on a long-term strategy -- empowering communities to lead the way in conservation and coexistence efforts.\nProducts from the Tom Yum Project.\nThe next chapter in BTEH's journey was the introduction of beehive fences -- an innovative solution, inspired by the fear elephants have for bees. Using beehive fences can protect crops from elephant damage and provide farmers with additional income through honey production. Beehive fences demonstrated that conservation can bring tangible benefits for communities, and help change local attitudes towards elephants. Instead of seeing them as a threat, they turned out to be allies in sustainable development.\nBeehive fences alone cannot fully resolve conflict between elephants and people though. They are labour-intensive and impractical for large-scale implementation. When crops highly attractive to elephants, such as pineapple, sugarcane or corn, are grown near wild elephant habitats, deterring them becomes particularly difficult. In household surveys conducted by Bring The Elephant Home, many farmers expressed a desire to shift towards crop species that elephants tend to avoid.\nThis outcome inspired BTEH's Tom Yum Project, which reflects the organisation's philosophy of culturally integrated conservation. Spearheaded by BTEH's elephant researcher Ave Owen, the initiative began with a community workshop, where farmers were asked which crops they believed elephants would naturally avoid and would be interested in planting. Those eager to participate joined the first study to test the effectiveness of these crops in reducing elephant-related damage.\nThe project now promotes the cultivation of crops like lemongrass, chilli and galangal -- ingredients in Thailand's iconic tom yum soup. Additional workshops introduced ways to use these crops for elephant-friendly products such as teas, soaps, candles and tom yum soup. These crops not only provide valuable produce but also play a crucial role in mitigating human-elephant conflict.\nAntoinette van de Water, founder and director of Bring The Elephant Home.\nThe success of the Tom Yum Project demonstrates that coexistence is possible by implementing practical, locally relevant solutions. Farmers benefit from growing crops that are economically viable and ecologically sustainable, reinforcing the principle that conservation can and should align with human well-being.\n\"People living near elephants hold the key to sustainable solutions,\" Van de Water added. This understanding has driven the organisation's shift towards community-driven conservation, working hand in hand with farmers to develop strategies that benefit both people and wildlife.\nCombining organically grown elephant-resistant crops with beehives helps farmers protect their fields, diversify income and reduce violent encounters with elephants. More importantly, these solutions can transform landscapes and shift mindsets.\n\"Communities that once viewed elephants as a burden started to see them as part of a shared future,\" Van de Water said. \"These experiences reinforced the notion that coexistence is complex and dynamic -- never fully conflict-free. It's about building connections.\"\nOver the past 20 years, BTEH has grown from a small grassroots initiative into a conservation movement active on three continents -- Asia, Europe and Africa. Through research, community engagement, and collaboration with scientists and conservationists worldwide, the organisation has made significant strides in promoting human-elephant coexistence.\nThe success of BTEH has always relied on partnerships and shared efforts. Researchers, universities, governments, other NGOs, companies and local people have worked side by side to co-create solutions that benefit people, elephants and the environment. BTEH has a strong belief that conservation isn't something that can be achieved in isolation. Every project, every output and every step forward has been powered by the collective strength of our supporters, partners and communities.\nThe Tom Yum Project began as a community workshop.\nEducation plays a crucial role in BTEH's work. Through workshops, field visits and outreach programmes, the organisation has empowered thousands of students and volunteers to become advocates for sustainable wildlife conservation. Building a culture of coexistence starts with inclusion and access to the benefits of conservation. When people see the value of wildlife, and when the value of wildlife, as well as the burden, is shared equitably, people living with wild animals will become more tolerant and committed to protecting them.\nAt the heart of BTEH's work is a mission to increase the chances of elephant survival in the wild and create a world where both people and elephants can thrive. The organisation's values emphasise fostering inclusivity, celebrating diversity, ensuring equity, embodying compassion and empowering communities.\n\"We are proud of what we have achieved, but we know there is still much to be done. The road ahead may be long, but we are excited to walk it with our partners, communities and supporters,\" said Khwankhao Sinhaseni, BTEH's country director.\nFor Thanasit, despite the fact that elephants sometimes damage his crops, he is never angry as he believes elephants and humans can always live together in harmony.\n\"Am I angry or do I hate the elephants that cause so much damage to my crops? No, I am not angry, nor do I hate them. Because if we can live together in harmony, it will lead to sustainability and benefit our environment. We have to think of a way to live with these wild elephants,\" he concluded.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat type of condominium are you most interested in?\nStudio\n1-bedroom\n2-bedroom\n3-bedroom\nPenthouse\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nDo you like the content of this article?\n5\n0\nCOMMENT",

For Thailand and Malaysia, this means navigating an especially tricky strait. The region is no stranger to this balancing act, or mengayuh antara dua karang, as the Malay proverb goes.\nBut the stakes are higher than ever, and with the US as volatile as it is powerful, the challenge now is whether the traditional \"bamboo diplomacy\" can bend without breaking.\nThe past four years have seen Thailand and the rest of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) members growing increasingly adept at the delicate art of balance, navigating the competitive (and often contradictory) agendas of the US and China. Rather than \"navigating\", both countries appear to be profiting from the US-China rivalry.\nADVERTISEMENT\n00:00\n/\n02:12\nPeach Pachara: Local roots to global reach\nTruvid\nRead Article\nMalaysia, for instance, aims to double its global market share of the overall chip trade by 2029, capitalising on the shifting dynamics between the US and China. Similarly, Thailand is preparing for factories relocating from China due to anticipated US tariffs, positioning itself as an attractive destination for semiconductor manufacturing.\nRELATED\nworld\nUS blacklists 29 more Chinese companies over alleged forced labour in Xinjiang\nbusiness\nThai economic and investment landscape under Trump 2.0\nWith Mr Trump back in Washington, Southeast Asia's \"strategic ambiguity\" faces an unprecedented test. Even in stable times, America's commitment to the region has been inconsistent; under Mr Trump, it's a wild card. The pressing question now is whether countries like Thailand and Malaysia can continue relying on their deft bamboo diplomacy or risk becoming entangled -- too close to China, with an unpredictable America holding the shears.\nChina's economic influence in the region is hardly news, and Thailand and Malaysia have been careful to foster economic ties with Beijing without compromising their autonomy. It's a delicate equilibrium, especially as China remains Southeast Asia's largest trading partner.\nAssertive China, unpredictable US\nThe panda loves bamboo, and in this case, Thailand and Malaysia's willingness to accommodate Chinese trade, investment, and infrastructure projects has kept the bamboo growing. However, with Mr Trump's expected protectionist agenda -- and his known aversion to multilateralism -- Asean faces a dilemma: how close can it be with China without being fenced in?\nIn Malaysia, Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim has expressed concern about potential tariffs on Malaysian exports to the US, a signal of how delicate the economic tightrope is. Mr Trump's transactional approach may appeal to some, but for economies reliant on exports and foreign investment, \"America First\" could mean America alone. This leaves Malaysia and Thailand in need of a hedge.\nBut rather than putting all their bets on the panda, they might double down on regional partnerships and trade blocs like the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) to diversify trade and lessen their vulnerability.\nAs China's influence steadily grows in Southeast Asia, the US presence in the region remains erratic, shaped by shifting administrations and domestic political priorities. Mr Trump's first term left Asean countries questioning whether Washington's attention had permanently drifted. With Mr Trump's return, Southeast Asia faces deeper doubts -- not only about America's reliability but also about its strategic relevance to the region's long-term goals.\nFor Thailand, which has historically enjoyed a close relationship with the US, the shifting tides are especially complex. While maintaining security ties with Washington, Thailand has simultaneously been building economic and infrastructure partnerships with China. For Malaysia, the balancing act is similarly delicate. Both countries recognise that a re-engaged US, if focused solely on counterbalancing China, could introduce more risks than benefits.\nMr Trump's \"America First\" agenda, alongside recent US withdrawals from Afghanistan and Washington's limited leverage in crises like Ukraine and Gaza, have spotlighted America's unpredictable commitment, reminding Asean leaders of the potential costs of dependency on any single superpower.\nCaught between an increasingly assertive China and an unpredictable America, Thailand and Malaysia are reluctant to play pieces in a larger geopolitical game. The only reassurance, however, comes from Mr Trump's \"straight talking\" credence: What you see is what you get -- or so the hope goes.\nBamboo Dilemma: Bend or Break?\nThis brings us back to bamboo diplomacy. Historically, Asean has thrived by bending rather than breaking, cultivating a flexibility that suits the region's collective interest. But flexibility can only go so far before it risks becoming subservience, and the return of Mr Trump's \"America First\" approach puts Asean's centrality to a serious test. There seems to be no consensus within Asean as to how far the bamboo should bend.\nSoutheast Asia is unlikely to rank high on the new president's agenda, except concerning US-China relations. Thailand and Malaysia, therefore, will have to be nimble with a renewed focus on regional autonomy. Neither country wants to be fenced in by China nor dependent on an unpredictable US. They must engage both powers strategically, keeping their economies resilient and their foreign policies flexible.\nSoutheast Asia's bamboo diplomacy remains resilient, bending just enough to appease both the panda and the eagle. Yet, with Mr Trump's return, this balancing act grows even more precarious. Whether it can keep Asean afloat remains uncertain, but if Asean nations excel at anything, it's navigating turbulent waters. For Thailand and Malaysia, the coming years will be about staying steady -- without capsising or becoming the panda's next meal. For Asean, the search for consensus has never been more urgent.\nSyed Nizamuddin Bin Sayed Khassim is an administrative and diplomatic officer with the Malaysian government.

However, adverse effects on non-US oil and gas players will outpace the rise in volumes, while US operators are expected to benefit from both higher volumes and eased regulations.\nSelling pressure prevailed on the Stock Exchange of Thailand early last week before buying interest in leading blue chips like Delta Electronics kicked in and supported overall momentum. With its material influence on the market, gains in DELTA managed to offset losses in other sectors such as energy.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThis week, the SET Index should continue to move with blue chips in the 1,450-1,500 range. Factors related to individual stocks will probably outweigh those influencing overall market sentiment, as several companies will provide management guidance for the fourth quarter and the 2025 outlook following their results announcements.\nThis is the time of year when medium- to long-term investors as well as institutional investors assess portfolio adjustments for the coming year, usually in late November and early December before entering the long holidays. Therefore, we believe individual plays will be more influential than developments affecting the broader benchmark index. Attractive plays would include:\nRELATED\nthailand\nUN report shows gender gaps\nbusiness\nPush to tackle debt via stronger growth\nFirms whose 2025 business plans set targets for continuous growth, after achieving this year's targets;\nSignals of an earnings turnaround, such as China-linked plays resulting from Chinese stimulus, and\nNew S-curve businesses that will invest more amid fragile economic conditions, in areas such as data centres and artificial intelligence.\nAmong positive factors expected to influence trade, US Federal Reserve interest rate cuts have been within expectations and the market seems to have priced in another cut at the final policy meeting of this year. Therefore, bond yields that spiked on US election speculation could turn lower as investors take profits. We expect bond yields to be on the downtrend in any case.\nLocally, the Monetary Policy Committee will hold its final meeting of the year on Dec 18, after surprising the market with an interest rate cut last month. However, Bank of Thailand Governor Sethaput Suthiwartnarueput has already signalled that future rate cuts would be gradual as the central bank needs to preserve ammunition to propel the economy in case of need.\nIn a related development, the market is awaiting official confirmation on the identity of the next Bank of Thailand board chairman, after weeks of speculation that the government has been pushing its candidate for the job. The Ministry of Finance, meanwhile, has proposed to trim contributions to the Financial Institutions Development Fund (FIDF) from 0.46% at present to compensate for debt reduction measures and reinforce the central bank's policy rate cut. However, the BoT governor has already indicated he disagrees with this idea.\nOn the external front, the market will continue to monitor the Chinese government's economic stimulus efforts. \"China's government is capable of driving sustainable economic development,\" Premier Li Qiang declared recently, adding that Beijing could still apply additional fiscal and monetary tools to achieve the long-term economic growth target at 5%.\nHowever, the recent meeting of top policymakers did not yield much policy clarity and triggered selling pressure. We anticipate clearer details next month when sub-committees are set to meet and flesh out the ideas discussed earlier.\nAmong negative factors, the prospect of a US and global economic slowdown remains a key risk to monitor. Recent US economic indicators may appear to be better than expected but the overall trend could remain to the downside. Thus, the recently inflated market could periodically face selling pressure.\nNow that the US election is out of the way, we will be seeing renewed attention paid to major conflicts that have resisted easy solutions. Analysts believe discussions between the Trump administration and the parties to the Russia-Ukraine war could be easier than those with Israel.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWould you consider buying a house in a gated community or as a standalone property?\nGated community\nStandalone house\nEither, depending on location and price\nNo preference\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nThailand\nBusiness\nPolitics\nGlobal stocks\nUS election\nTrump Trade\nRepublican\nPolicy\n\u0e18\u0e38\u0e23\u0e01\u0e34\u0e08\n\u0e01\u0e32\u0e23\u0e40\u0e21\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e07\n\u0e2b\u0e38\u0e49\u0e19\u0e17\u0e31\u0e48\u0e27\u0e42\u0e25\u0e01\n\u0e01\u0e32\u0e23\u0e40\u0e25\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e01\u0e15\u0e31\u0e49\u0e07\u0e2a\u0e2b\u0e23\u0e31\u0e10\u0e2f\n\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e23\u0e04\u0e23\u0e35\u0e1e\u0e31\u0e1a\u0e25\u0e34\u0e01\u0e31\u0e19\n\u0e19\u0e42\u0e22\u0e1a\u0e32\u0e22\nDo you like the content of this article?\n1\n0\nCOMMENT",

The 12.9 kilometre section forms part of the wider Bangkok-Nakhon Ratchasima high-speed train route.\u2009High-speed train project Saraburi-Kaeng Khoi\nWhen a powerful country comes courting, a smaller country is wise not to reject the courtship out of hand, even if it isn't fully swayed or convinced. The lesser of the two powers may appear to be an eager, willing and ready partner, but there may well be a measure of ambiguity behind the ready acquiescence and responsive smile.\nBeijing has repeatedly urged Bangkok to inject some speed into a delay-ridden rail project designed to connect Thailand to China via Laos by high-speed train.\nAs Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi put it to the Thais earlier this year, \"The two sides should speed up the development of the China-Thailand Railway and push for an early realisation of the China-Laos-Thailand Connectivity Development Corridor\".\nADVERTISEMENT\nDespite constant prodding from China, including Xi Jinping, and vested interest groups on the Thai side, such as the CP conglomerate led by Dhanin Chearavanont and the pro-rail project strategising of Pansak Vinyaratn for the Shinawatra clan, the Thai government has been taking its time.\nReasons for the delays are multifold. It's part due to the shifting nature of the Bangkok government that has, since the project's inception, gone from coup to military rule to military-civilian rule, to a civilian caretaker government, to a tempestuous election cycle in which the party with the most votes was disqualified, resulting in the current coalition government that includes both conservative, pro-military elements and the daughter of the quixotic Thaksin Shinawatra, who was allowed to return to Thailand after a long exile on the condition that he spend some time in jail.\nRELATED\nthailand\nMAHLE Expands R&amp;D in Thailand to Drive Innovation\nbusiness\nSecure Returns, Shape the Future with ESG Funds\nCovid undoubtedly slowed things down a bit too. Still, the rapid expansion of Bangkok's BTS and MRT during the same period are proof positive that infrastructure projects can be built quickly if sufficient political will is present.\nThe Lao section of China's Belt and Road, a high-speed train designed for an eventual link from Kunming to Singapore, is up and running, mostly shuttling Chinese cargo back and forth since the average Lao can hardly afford it.\nThe Thai portion of the project remains in limbo, and Malaysia seems to be of two minds about the through train to Singapore as well.\nThe small percentage of track laid to date may be disappointing to the impatient powers that be in China, but is there not a method to the madness if the end result gives Thais more agency in what is essentially a China-constructed and largely China-controlled train line piercing the heartland of Thailand?\nRejecting outright Chinese financing of the project, nixing land concessions and trying to tiptoe around the questions of political indebtedness inevitably led to delays, delays well worth the wait for the sake of sovereignty.\nEven so, Thai investors acknowledge they have already borrowed deeply, including Chinese capital, for an investment which even under the rosiest circumstances will take decades to recoup.\nDelays due to environmental concerns may not be much of an issue in an autocratic state like China, where a massive high-speed rail network criss-crosses the land. It's an impressive feat, but it was literally railroaded through, without citizen consent.\nThailand, while not entirely democratic, allows room for civic activism and free speech; it's got a vital civil society in which stakeholders high and low have at least some say in the matter.\nWhether it be small land-holding farmers in Nakhon Ratchasima province and or aesthetic concerns linked to historical preservation, such as the somewhat unwelcome spectre of big brassy trains barreling through the outskirts of historic Ayutthaya, citizen voices do matter.\nThen there are political perturbations, ranging from what looked like politically-driven cooperation under former prime minister Prayut Chan-o-cha to the concerns of opposition figures such as Pita Limjaroenrat, who recently told a Harvard audience that Thailand needs to focus on building local train networks to alleviate traffic and help small farmers.\nBetween these two poles -- the fast train from China that stands to benefit corporations and the rich, and the incremental improvement of small-gauge lines commensurate with the needs of farmers and ordinary citizens, politicians have an important role to play.\nThe squabbles and quibbles, while inefficient, have the salutatory effect of buying time for a project that will lock Thailand tightly into China's Belt and Road scheme for years to come.\nThailand has been railroaded before, especially in the early days of the Cold War when a few corrupt and opportunistic politicians pocketed US money to pave the way for seven massive US air bases on Thai soil.\nThat was the beginning of a \"beautiful friendship\" in which US Cold Warriors transformed Thailand into a US-dominated bulwark dedicated to the project of fighting communism. Outside of the direct beneficiaries of US largesse and a handful of ideologues, few Thais were enthused, but the nation went along for the ride, extracting what advantage it could as a strong cash wind blew in from the West.\nThe US bases, the Friendship Highway and the flurry of infrastructure projects funded by the US, designed first and foremost to support the war effort, constituted the Belt and Road of its day.\nThe US lost in Vietnam, and was asked to withdraw its bases in Thailand, creating an opening for China, which, for a brief period, shared the US and Thai agenda of resisting Vietnamese influence in Indochina.\nSince then, Thailand has been effectively orbited by two foreign \"suns\".\nChina and the US are both powerful partners vying for influence in geopolitics, investment and trade.\nTurning away from ideology towards trade and opening up, China has made great inroads in the last few decades, building on the appeal of shared prosperity, new technology and age-old ethnic ties. America remains a player, despite years of neglecting its old ally. It's not just the English-speaking Americanised elite that wish for better relations with the US; even Thais critical of the US see it as a balancer to outsized Chinese influence.\nThe point is, balancing doesn't work if you lean too much to one side or the other.\nThere's room for cooperation with both the US and China; it's not a competition or a zero sum game, despite what hardliners in both the US and China might like to believe.\nThe question is where to draw the line.\nUnlike those stifling days during the height of the Cold War when autocratic generals such as Sarit Thanarat and Thanom Kittikachorn could run the country like a private fiefdom, Thailand is a much more open and complex country now, with a veritable world city as its capital.\nWhy rush madly into building an express train to and from China, when creating a network of light rail to alleviate domestic traffic congestion will serve both farmers and factories in the hinterland?\nThailand keeps nodding yes to the big train from the big neighbour above, and it's possible those saying yes mean yes, but sometimes yes means no, and in the very least, yes does not mean unconditional consent.\nWhether the ambiguity created by Thai foot-dragging is born of confusion or is an instinctive strategic stance remains to be determined, but the date of completion for the rail project keeps getting pushed further into the future.\nIn this sense, ambiguity and even apparent inefficiency can be useful in retaining agency in the face of imperious demands from powerful outsiders. Inasmuch as the foot-dragging is a passive-aggressive approach, diplomatic disappointment is bound to follow, but in the meantime, everyone appears to be getting along, even if they're not getting what they want, and that's preferable to outright conflict.\nThais have shown over the centuries a knack for coming to terms with powerful influences, from the earliest days of absorbing Indic and Khmer influences, to playing Britain and France off one another during the colonial period, from the short-lived resistance to Japan to \"cooperation\" and back to resistance again.\nEven during the Vietnam War heyday of heavily lopsided US influence in Thailand, friendly feelers were quietly being put out to China, and it was upon the soil of such clandestine efforts that the seeds of Sino-Thai relations took root and finally blossomed.\nThailand is again at an inflexion point, being buffeted by winds from the east and the west.\nCall it bamboo bending in the wind, or political resourcefulness or deceptive opportunism, there is something to be said for a gentle, non-confrontational way of handling disagreements. Over time, being flexible has served Thais well in maintaining a high degree of agency and independence against baffling odds.\nPhilip J Cunningham is a media researcher covering Asian politics.

A US$3 billion (104.7 billion baht) IMF bailout that followed the next year came with tough austerity measures that Mr Dissanayake's party said increased the economic burden on the poor.\nMr Dissanayake leads a coalition, the National People's Power, which held just three of the 225 seats in the dissolved legislature. There have been no opinion polls on voters' preferences, but political analysts expect the NPP to capture a parliamentary majority, an outcome that would ensure powers to pass new legislation and revamp the bureaucracy.\nADVERTISEMENT\n\"The NPP expects a strong mandate for the parliament. We are confident that the people will give it to us,\" Mr Dissanayake said on Thursday after casting his vote. \"A strong parliament is sufficient for us. The laws and bills that we bring will be beneficial for the people.\"\nRELATED\nopinion\nFlood let-down\nworld\nChina's Xi touts 'maritime silk road' on South Asia tour\nTop of Mr Dissanayake's agenda is a push to rewrite the deal with the IMF. The president has said he's committed to continuing the funding facility struck with the Washington-based lender but wants to amend unpopular austerity measures, trim down tax increases and cuts to fuel subsidies.\n\"To offer an alternative to the IMF, you will need parliament's approval,\" said Aditya Gowdara Shivamurthy, associate fellow at the Observer Research Foundation, a New Delhi think tank. \"Changing the constitution, not selling state-owned enterprises, trying to generate sources of revenue -- this will all need parliament or parliamentary oversight.\"\nThe NPP's main challenger is the Samagi Jana Balawegaya, led by Sajith Premadasa, who Mr Dissanayake defeated in the presidential vote. Former president Ranil Wickremesinghe isn't contesting the election but is supporting the New Democratic Front. A flurry of new independent parties is also in contention.\nPolls opened at 7am local time and closed at 4pm, with results expected to come in from early yesterday.\nSri Lanka's benchmark Colombo All Share Index closed up 0.6% at 13,198.80 after a shortened day's trading, while the rupee was 0.1% higher at 291.96 per dollar at 5.15pm local time. Sri Lankan markets were shut yesterday for a Buddhist festival. IMF officials are expected to visit Sri Lanka soon after the parliamentary election to kick start a third review of the loan programme, a precursor to unlocking additional funding. Once the new legislature is formed, the government will need to present its federal budget for 2025, which will be watched closely by the IMF and creditors to determine if economic targets can be met.\nAlready local authorities are discussing amendments in taxes and social security benefits with the IMF for new ways to reach the program's objectives. Meanwhile, the country continues to inch closer to completing a debt restructuring with international creditors.\n\"It is our responsibility now to keep economic stability without allowing the society to break down,\" Mr Dissanayake said on Monday during a campaign rally. \"But to rebuild the country, to do what we expect to do, several political structures have to be built. The most important is the parliament.\"\nSri Lanka's main stock index, sovereign bond prices and the rupee have risen in tandem since Mr Dissanayake's election in September, on investor expectation that the government will strike new terms with the IMF, according to Tellimer Research.\nMr Dissanayake's election victory followed years of political tumult in Sri Lanka, after a debt default and economic meltdown in 2022 led to riots in the streets of Colombo and the ouster of President Gotabaya Rajapaksa. The NPP started out as a violent Marxist movement in the 1970s and 1980s, but has since renounced violence and run on a broadly leftist political platform.\nMr Dissanayake and his backers have said they will follow a balanced foreign policy that maintains strong relations with both India and China, which have both tussled for influence in the South Asian island given its strategic location on key shipping lanes.\nMr Dissanayake has pledged to re-assess an energy deal by Adani Green on concerns over the purchase price and amid allegations of a lack of transparency in the awarding of the project and court challenges from environmental groups. He has also promised to abolish Sri Lanka's executive presidency and replace it with a system led by a prime minister more beholden to parliament, in what proponents say is intended to inoculate against a future slide to authoritarianism. Such a reform would require two-thirds support from the parliament.\n\"The NPP's appeal is that it is a change,\" said Bhavani Fonseka, senior researcher and lawyer at the Colombo-based Centre for Policy Alternatives. \"This in a context when voters are frustrated and they are not confident with the existing actors in the political terrain.\"\u2009\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\nAnusha Ondaatjie is a reporter, Bloomberg News.

Marina Silva is trying\nBrazil's environment minister, a renowned former activist, helps push climate change to the top of President Lula's agenda. Her next task is to do the same thing for the world.\nPUBLISHED : 9 Nov 2024 at 13:04\nWRITER:\nBloomberg News\n&nbsp; Small\n&nbsp; Medium\n&nbsp; Large\n1\n5\nAn aerial view shows a deforested area during an operation to combat deforestation near Uruara, Para State, Brazil, on Jan 21, 2023. (Photo: Reuters)\nWASHINGTON \u2014 When the United Nations (UN) climate conference COP29 kicks off Monday in Baku, Azerbaijan, attendees will be grappling with the re-election of former United States President Donald Trump. Countries will try to find a path forward that bypasses Trump, who is hostile to emissions-cutting policies and has vowed to pull the country back out of the Paris accord.\nYet even as delegates arrive in Baku, preparations are underway for the 2025 edition of the summit, in Brazil. COP30 will be the first COP held in the Amazon rainforest and will see the debut of a new global order on climate, with the US likely playing a much diminished role and China, possibly, a larger one. That raises the stakes, and the pressure on the host \u2014 which was already high.\n\"The challenge of being the leader of COP30 next year, in the heart of the Amazon forest, is huge,\" said Marina Silva, Brazil's environment minister and top climate diplomat, at an event on the sidelines of the World Bank and IMF meetings in Washington, DC, in late October. The event is already being talked about as \"the green COP,\" Silva added.\nADVERTISEMENT\nFor two years in a row, COP has been hosted by oil-rich autocracies with climate plans that are \"critically insufficient,\" according to the research partnership Climate Action Tracker. Brazil is different. It may be among the world's top 10 oil exporters, but it is also a world leader in new wind and solar installations and has strong climate commitments. So observers hope that when Brazil hosts the talks, more aggressive goal-setting will be possible. Otherwise, the world will be in even deeper trouble.\nRELATED\nlife\nFeel the South American vibe in Bangkok\nbusiness\nOR eager to sell shares of underperforming businesses\n2025 is the 10-year anniversary of the Paris agreement, when nearly 200 countries agreed to rein in warming from levels so catastrophic it could reshape the world map. But countries are decidedly not on track. Temperatures have already risen 1.3 degrees Celsius compared to the preindustrial era. Despite progress in scaling up green energy worldwide, fossil fuel use hit a record high last year and emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases are still rising at levels that the UN warns could result in \"ire\" warming of up to 3.1\u00b0C.&nbsp;\nThat means the time for talk is over. \"If we are ambitious about announcing goals, we have to be ambitious about implementing them,\u201d Silva said in an interview with\nBloomberg Green\n. To that end, \"Brazil's COP has to be the COP for reducing CO\n2\nemissions.\"\nBrazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva (who is not related to Marina Silva) chose to host COP30 in Bel\u00e9m, a port city near the mouth of the Amazon River, so that tens of thousands of decision-makers can see the richness and fragility of the rainforest up close. One of the most biodiverse places on Earth, the Amazon also stores massive amounts of CO2, making it an essential defence against climate change. But as this year has shown, the forest is itself vulnerable to warming. Hot, dry conditions have helped fuel thousands of fires, scorching millions of hectares of land and sending smoke as far as the capital of Brasilia and the financial hub of Sao Paulo.\nLuiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, Brazil's president, top centre, and Emmanuel Macron, France's president, top centre left, sail to visit Combu Island near Belem on March 26, 2024. (Photo: Bloomberg)\nThe pressure for COP30 to deliver rests on Lula, and also on Silva. Born into poverty on a rubber plantation in a rural, forested part of northern Brazil, Silva did not learn to read or write until she was a teenager. After rising to prominence as an activist, she joined Lula\u2019s government during his first term as president.\nSilva, 66, found success in politics not because of charisma but to a character that is \"demure,\" \"genuine\" and \"profoundly ethical,\" people who have worked with her say. Her steadfast advocacy for the Amazon and its communities, and her willingness to draw red lines against policies she can\u2019t support, have gained admiration not just in Brazil but around the world.&nbsp;\nSilva's influence was critical to President Lula moving climate issues up his agenda after winning a third term in 2022. Brazil last year committed to a roughly 53% reduction in its emissions by 2030, compared to 2005 levels. It has pledged to end deforestation by 2030.\nShe \"brought Lula around to appreciating the importance of protecting the Amazon, and Brazil taking environmental leadership in the world,\" said Steve Schwartzman, associate vice president for tropical forest policy at the Environmental Defence Fund.\nShe is \"always reminding\" her colleagues that there is no time to waste to tackle the climate crisis, said Andr\u00e9 Corr\u00eaa do Lago, secretary for climate, energy, and environment at the Brazilian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\nMarina&nbsp;Silva, Brazilian Minister of the Environment, speaks during a press conference at the 16th United Nations Biodiversity Summit (COP16), in Yumbo, Colombia, on Oct 31, 2024. (Photo: Reuters)\nAt COP29 and COP30, Silva can bring her credibility to bear on tense arguments over fossil fuel use, climate finance and other contentious issues. But whether that will be enough to get past long-standing political deadlock, largely between the developing and developed worlds, isn\u2019t clear.\nLula and Silva have known each other for decades, their relationship shifting from friendly, to estranged, to closely allied. Both were members of Brazil's Workers' Party early on. In her twenties, Silva worked with rubber tapper and activist Francisco Alves Mendes Filho \u2014 better known as Chico Mendes \u2014 who fought for communities being driven off their lands by cattle ranchers' hired guns. He was killed for it.\nHis assassination put a spotlight on the Amazon\u2019s deforestation problem. Following in his footsteps, Silva became a prominent Amazon activist and ultimately proved successful at navigating politics. In 1994, at age 35, she became the youngest woman elected to the Brazilian senate. By the time Lula won the Brazilian presidency, taking office in 2003, Silva was the obvious candidate for environment minister.\nUnder her watch, Brazil launched its first deforestation action plan. It is credited with driving down deforestation more than 80% between 2004 and 2012, even as cattle herds and soybean production grew. That showed clearing more trees wasn\u2019t needed to develop these agricultural sectors.&nbsp;\nBut during Lula's second term, Silva resigned. She was exhausted by the constant pushback against environmental regulations both inside and outside the government and objected to large-scale development in the Amazon that Lula and other officials supported. Silva ran for president herself in 2010, 2014 and 2018, without success.\nThen came President Jair Bolsonaro, who oversaw a systematic dismantling of the country\u2019s forest protections. Deforestation surged. Bolsonaro's far-right agenda was what finally brought Lula and Silva back together. So when Lula took on Bolsonaro in the 2022 presidential election, Silva helped her former boss win.\nBrazil epitomizes the one-step-forward, one-step-back nature of climate progress as a country that now gets 90% of its electricity from non-fossil sources but remains a major oil exporter. It is unusual, however, in that the biggest source of its emissions is from changes in land use. Because of that, Silva advocated for, and Lula embraced, the goal of Brazil ending deforestation in just a few years. And it has made good progress, despite the government having to rebuild its capacity to thwart illegal deforestation after the Bolsonaro era.\nLast year Brazil cut deforestation by 50%, according to government data, and this year it has dropped a significant amount again, Silva told\nBloomberg Green\n. By the time Lula's term ends in 2026, she said, Brazil has to have policies operational to ensure \"zero deforestation in 2030.\"\nAn aerial view shows a deforested plot of the&nbsp;Amazon&nbsp;near Porto Velho, Rondonia State, Brazil, on Sept 17, 2019.&nbsp;(Photo: Reuters)\nIn the Amazon, many poor families have cleared trees to grow sugarcane, soybeans or other crops as a matter of survival. If the country eliminates deforestation, rainforest communities will still need ways to survive and improve their living standards.\nCorr\u00eaa do Lago said Silva has always been \"very sensitive to the social dimension of environmental issues.\" Beyond saving nature, he said, \"she wants to take care of people.\" So Silva splits her efforts between stamping out deforestation and trying to make conservation of the forest profitable.\nOne possible way to do that is through carbon credits. Lula\u2019s government has introduced legislation to launch a state-run carbon market. The effort has stalled in Brazil's congress, partly due to pushback from conservative lawmakers backed by the cattle and agriculture industries, which benefited the most from aggressive tree-clearing.\nThere is also the Amazon Fund. After Lula launched it in 2008, other countries began to give Brazil donations toward halting deforestation and supporting the communities and industries reliant on the forest. Foreign donors stopped contributing in 2019 as deforestation increased under Bolsonaro. Lula later revived the fund, and it is grown to roughly 4 billion reais (US$710 million).\nBut speaking in Washington last month, Silva made clear that donations alone are not going to cut it. That is why she will be talking about climate finance at COP29, as well as pitching a new Basel Accord, an international agreement on capital requirements for banks, on the sidelines of the forthcoming G20 meeting in Brazil. She also wants to see new financial instruments that embrace conservation.\nTrump's return cannot be allowed to hinder global progress, she said Nov 6, and the United States still has a big responsibility to reduce emissions: \"We're working hard, and obviously the world is going to make sure that no country makes any kind of stepbacks in relation to what we've achieved.\"\n\"We have turned nature into money, and now we have to turn money into preserving, restoring and conserving nature,\" Silva said. \"This is the only way to make money in the future. Otherwise, it won't work.\"\nThere remains one big source of tension between Silva and Lula. The president has revived plans to expand offshore drilling, saying the proceeds can finance the energy transition. Silva has been adamant that Brazil and the world must abandon fossil fuels. Lula and Silva have not opposed each other publicly on the subject, though it could come to a head at COP30 or sooner.\nRising emissions could ultimately be ruinous for the Amazon, even if deforestation is halted. The grim possibility hangs over Silva. But the enormity of the challenge ahead will not slow her down, she said: \"I know the size of the responsibility, of the efforts \u2014 and I feel committed.\"\nSmoke billows from a forest fire affecting the Brasilia National Park in Brasilia on Sept 16, 2024.

A year later, the\nAsean Regional Forum\n(ARF) held its inaugural meeting, which took place in Bangkok and had 18 members, including the Asean 10.\nSince then, the ARF has served as the premier regional forum for both great powers and regional players to interact and exchange views on mutual and broader concerns.\nOver the past three decades, the ARF has also facilitated regular dialogue among members, helping to reduce trust deficits and mutual suspicion. While the forum has yet to reach the conflict solution stage, its platform for high-level dialogue and face-to-face contact has contributed positively to raising comfort levels and reducing tension.\nADVERTISEMENT\nDuring the first Myanmar crisis in 1988, this Asean-led mechanism promoted confidence among various stakeholders to search for acceptable solutions in later years. However, the new situation in Myanmar in the wake of the February 2021 coup has posed a serious challenge to Asean and its effectiveness, especially the ARF platform, regarding whether it can still have a similar impactful outcome by achieving peace.\nHowever, given today\u2019s global strategic complexity, forum members must evaluate what should be done to make the ARF more effective and relevant to the fast-changing world. Last year, during the Indonesian chair, the Asean leaders asked the Asean Secretariat to conduct an overall review as part of the ARF\u2019s 30th anniversary.\nRELATED\nsports\nSupachok confident in Thailand chances\nbusiness\nHow gold fosters economic growth and prosperity\nLooking back, when the ARF idea was broached, there were initial concerns, particularly from the United States. Washington was wary that such a forum might jeopardise its existing bilateral military alliances in the region formed during the Cold War. At the time, a new regional security platform could weaken the US influence and presence in the Asia Pacific. Washington was still happy with and relied on its five allies \u2014 Japan, South Korea, Australia, the Philippines and Thailand \u2014 in the Asia-Pacific for its global security guarantee.\nInitially, the members perceived the ARF as a safe space to engage China, which had not yet risen to its current prominence. Since its establishment, the ARF has been the region\u2019s only forum to engage all major powers, including the US, China, India and Russia, to attend alongside Asean and other leaders from the Asia-Pacific.\nDuring the 1990s, the geographical spread of the ARF was an issue of contention as the membership reached West Asia, including Pakistan and Mongolia in Northern Asia. Under the current circumstances and due to geopolitical competition and complexities, the ARF members have become more diverse and cover broader geographical locations.\nToday, the ARF has expanded from its original 18 members to 27, including the EU. Sri Lanka was the last country to join the ARF before the 2007 moratorium.\nIn retrospect, the Asean region has enjoyed relative peace in the past three decades, allowing member countries to focus on economic and social development.\nHowever, recent geopolitical shifts and unpredictability have had unavoidable repercussions on the region. As active members of the international system, Asean countries increasingly feel the impact of global strategic changes emanating from tense strategic competition among major powers, especially between the US and China. Asean does not want to become a pawn in the great powers\u2019 gameplans.\nConcerning Southeast Asia, Western strategists often view the region as two separate entities: mainland versus maritime Southeast Asia. Following the end of the Indochina War, mainland countries such as Cambodia, Laos, and Thailand enjoyed peace dividends with rapid economic growth. Myanmar remains an exception due to its internal problems and continued in-country fighting. Maritime Southeast Asia, meanwhile, has garnered global attention as its maritime zones crisscross the Pacific Ocean, facilitating international trade.\nWestern efforts have focused on the maritime region due to its critical role in trade connectivity, particularly in the energy sector. Issues surrounding the South China Sea and the safety of sea-lane communications have been perennial challenges to the stability of this maritime sphere as they have dominated the discourse on regional security for decades.\nCurrent issues, such as the Russia-Ukraine war, the Myanmar crisis, the Korean Peninsula, counterterrorism, and cyber security, have also created challenges that the ARF must navigate. The Gaza crisis will be high on the ARF\u2019s agenda this year, with the safety and security of Asean citizens at stake in the Middle East.\nIn more ways than one, some of these hot issues have created a stalemate in pushing the ARF forward. Despite having clear procedures and approaches, the ARF has primarily been engaged in confidence-building measures. It is true that some members still mistrust others, especially over the Korean Peninsula, but suffice it to say that the forum has enabled its members to build a certain level of confidence and trust.\nNow, the question is whether the ARF can move towards the upper tier of preventive diplomacy.\nAt the 31st ARF in Vientiane on July 27, the issues related to revitalizing ARF will be discussed \u201cin a holistic and comprehensive\u201d manner. As the ARF serves as a foreign ministerial platform to address security issues affecting the region and beyond, the quality and transparency of discussions are crucial. Enhancing interactions among ministers is essential for better understanding and awareness.\nOther ideas to enhance the ARF\u2019s effectiveness have also been discussed, such as improving the structure of senior official meetings, including inter-sessional meetings, to enable a frank exchange of views. Certain inter-sessional meetings could be streamlined to promote action-oriented implementations, especially issues dedicated to disaster relief, counter-terrorism, maritime security, etc.\nFurthermore, there should be more interaction and utilisation between track 1 and track 1.5 in the ARF with track 2 mechanisms, such as the members of ARF Experts and Eminent Persons, Council for Security Cooperation in the Asia Pacific, to get additional inputs and insights on emerging security issues through regular consultations. Indeed, after 17 years of moratorium, it is also high time to reconsider the request for new memberships.\nAt 57, Asean has matured and can make bolder decisions. The bloc must work closely with its ARF partners to shape \u201cmore predictable and constructive post-Cold War regional relations in the Asia-Pacific\u201d.\nKavi Chongkittavorn\nA veteran journalist on regional affairs\nKavi Chongkittavorn is a veteran journalist on regional affairs\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat is your budget range for renting a condominium?\nUnder 10,000 THB/month\n10,000 - 20,000 THB/month\n20,000 - 40,000 THB/month\n40,000 - 60,000 THB/month\nOver 60,000 THB/month\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nAsean\nGeopolitics\nAsean Regional Forum\nDo you like the content of this article?\n2\n10\nCOMMENT\n(8)",

China is sending a precious piece of Buddha relics to Thailand for a 72-day procession in celebration of His Majesty King Maha Vajiralongkorn Phra Vajiraklaochaoyuhua's 72nd birthday and the 50th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Thailand. This piece of Buddha's remains, referred to as the \"Buddha Tooth Relic from the Lingguang Temple\", is arguably one of the most important Buddhist treasures ever discovered in China.\nThis relic has a mythological origin and a turbulent history. Based on the records, the Buddha left two pieces of tooth relics, one in Ceylon and the other one in a small northern Indian kingdom ruled by the Sakya clan (the Buddha's clan), named Oddiyana. In 1900, the European colonial armies raided Beijing and led to the destruction of the Lingguang Temple. From the stupa's ruins, a monk accidentally discovered an inscribed casket with a part read as \"the Sacred Tooth Relic of the Sakyamuni Buddha\". Later, devotees and scholars deem this tooth relic as a genuine piece from Oddiyana.\nAccording to historical records, around the fifth century, the Oddiyana tooth relic was brought to Khotan, an ancient central Asian Buddhist kingdom. In 475 AD, Faxian, a determined Chinese monk, embarked on a pilgrimage to India. His journey started in Nanjing but unfortunately stopped only at Khotan, where the plank road was broken, and he could not proceed. It turned out to be a blessing in disguise--his determination and devotion helped him befriend a Khotanese monk who secretly conferred him a bronze casket. Within, there are a tooth and fifteen smaller pieces of remains of the Buddha. Out of joy, Faxian brought the casket back to Nanjing where he guarded it discreetly for 15 years.\nADVERTISEMENT\n00:00\n/\n02:34\nPM sets bold course for nation\nTruvid\nRead Article\nDuring these years, a minister named Xiao Yan rose to power, abdicated the old emperor, and established a new dynasty. The new emperor was a devout Buddhist who aspired to become a wheel-turning monarch, like King Asoka. One day, his prince dreamed of the Buddha visiting China and an old monk spoke to him on his deathbed, \"There is a sacred treasure in my storeroom.\" Following the omen, the prince sent envoys to various temples asking for \"invaluable treasure.\" Faxian realised the opportunity and sent the tooth relic to the court.\nRELATED\nlife\nArtistic, with insects\nopinion\nExploiting the sacred\nThe Emporer and prince were both exceedingly thrilled by the tooth relic. They patronised Faxian and entitled him to be a sangha patriarch. Since then, the relic had been preserved at a special stupa in Faxian's temple. After, the story of this tooth relic becomes murky and obscure, as the relic became the Holy Grail and palladium for all Buddhist emperors. Like the Emerald Buddha for the Southeast Asian kings, Chinese emperors hunted for it and fought for ownership. Then, whoever found it would move it to the capital and arrange grander processions.\nIn 936, a monk stored the tooth relic in a sandalwood box inside a stone reliquary. From the historical records, the relic had already been relocated to northern China. In 1071, a Khitan Duchess sponsored an octagonal thirteen-story stupa in Beijing and treasured this stone reliquary in a lower crypt -- the exact stupa was destroyed by the European armies and led to the 1900 rediscovery.\nThe establishment of the People's Republic of China -- a proudly Communist regime -- did not invalidate the value of this tooth. But the Communist Party of China (CPC) fully acknowledges its diplomatic and political value, just like the ancient nobles and royalties. China has been strategically utilising the Buddha tooth relic as a political and diplomatic instrument to engage with the Buddhist world.\nIn June 1964, a grand ceremony was held at Lingguang Temple in Beijing to enshrine the Buddha tooth relic in a new stupa, attended by Chinese Buddhists and delegations from more than ten Asian nations. The splendid concrecation ritual turned out to be a major pan-Asian Buddhist celebration. The Lingguang Temple became a pilgrimage site for Buddhists across the world. For instance, the Thai ex-premier Yingluck Shinawatra paid her tribute to the tooth relic at the Lingguang Temple on Oct 28, 2014.\nThe Lingguang Temple tooth relic has accomplished seven successful diplomatic missions, including a procession in Thailand for the celebration of His Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej The Great's 75th birthday. On Dec 15, 2002, a charter flight carrying the sacred tooth relic arrived at the Don Muang Royal Thai Air Force Base. The relic was welcomed by the then Deputy Prime Minister, Wissanu Krea-ngam. After a 30-minute ritual, the relic was transferred from the aeroplane to the designated vehicle. The Buddha tooth relic was then escorted by a motorcade and protected by armed helicopters overhead, proceeding to Phutthamonthon, a giant Buddhist park 50 kilometres west of Bangkok. En route, thousands of Thai devotees knelt in reverence, with many holding Thai and Chinese flags or candles as their homage to the Triple Gems. A grand enshrinement ceremony commenced there with a 30-minute joint chanting by both Chinese and Thai monks. Everything was broadcast on Thai national television programmes.\nOn the third day of the procession, Her Royal Highness Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn paid tribute to the tooth relic at Phutthamonthon. Additionally, the then-Supreme Patriarch of Thailand, Somdet Phra Nyanasamvara, at the age of 90, made a pilgrimage to Phutthamonthon to the sacred relic. By the end of the event, nearly 5 million people venerated the relic, including many who specifically travelled from neighbouring countries.\nSoon, we will witness this Buddha tooth relic's second \"voyage\" to Thailand. It is a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, not only pertaining to the 2002 Thai procession but also to the procession of the Indian \"Kapilvastu Relics\" earlier this year. China and India, two Asian superpowers, seemingly are engaged in a cryptic Buddhist diplomatic battle. Both states attempt to capitalise on Buddhism as their invaluable religious heritage, bolstering their national images and soft power.\nBuddha's relics, like the Holy Grail and the Kaaba, are sacred objects that manifest their social and political power. The relics, fundamentally associated with the marvellous life and achievements of the Buddha, are the material testaments of the Buddhist teaching and the Buddha's indestructible sanctity. They are worshipped by the devotees, and the possession and display them signify a sense of paramount religious orthodoxy -- which is frequently associated with royalty, state authority, and governing legitimacy.\nFor millennia, the veneration of Buddha relics has followed a specific pattern of reverence and ritual, unchanged in essence. Yet, such sacred treasures have often transcended their religious significance, becoming tools for political legitimisation. State authorities and royal families across Asia have competed to claim stewardship over these relics, recognising their power to unite the faithful and validate their sovereignty. From King Asoka's assertion of Buddhist kingship to the modern diplomatic processions under state orchestration, relics worship reaffirms the intertwinement of spiritual devotion and corporeal authority.\nThe belief and faith in the Triple Gems ought to transcend national and cultural boundaries. The worship of Buddha relics is a pan-Asian cultural practice and oddly political as always -- these tiny pieces of ancient cremate remains host spectacular tours in numerous nations as agents of \"Buddhist diplomacy\". Their international exposures signify diplomatic friendship and boost nationalist Buddhist ideology. These relics connect pan-Asian international politics in a truly odd way.\nGuanxiong Qi is a Thai Studies PhD student at Chulalongkorn University specialising in Thai Buddhism.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWould you consider buying a house in a gated community or as a standalone property?\nGated community\nStandalone house\nEither, depending on location and price\nNo preference\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nBuddhism\nPolitics\nReligion\nDo you like the content of this article?\n9\n46\nCOMMENT\n(1)",

This aligns with economic growth in the retail and e-commerce sectors.\nMr Dhanant said Thailand Post's efforts to enhance the customer experience across all its business groups led to domestic parcel service growth of 18.5%, reflecting higher consumer confidence, as its 2024 brand trust survey found a 91.9% confidence level in the state enterprise.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat type of accommodation do you usually prefer when traveling in Thailand?\nLuxury hotels (5-star)\nMid-range hotels (3-4 star)\nHostels and guesthouses\nPrivate rentals (Airbnb or villas)\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nThailand Post\nChina\nLogistics\nJoint venture\nDo you like the content of this article?\n7\n24\nCOMMENT\n(4)",

While employment growth has slowed significantly, the Federal Reserve's Beige Book signals a broader economic deceleration. We expect the Fed to make four interest rate cuts in 2025, potentially bringing the federal funds rate down to 3.4% by year-end.\nThe International Monetary Fund projects increased trade barriers under the Trump administration could slow global economic growth by 0.1 to 0.8 percentage points in 2025, intensifying to 0.2 to 1.2 points in 2026.\nADVERTISEMENT\nHowever, we expect Trump's policies, if they materialise, will be implemented gradually, considering their potential impact on American consumers through higher import prices.\nTurning to China, Beijing since late September has shifted from a \"cautious\" to a \"stimulus\" mode, driven by three factors: addressing a severe economic slowdown; preparing for Trumponomics 2.0; and preventing a further stock market decline.\nRELATED\nbusiness\nBangchak refinery limits budget outlay\nbusiness\nCPN celebrates brace of corporate awards\nThe comprehensive stimulus package introduced by Chinese authorities includes: monetary policy easing, an 800-billion-yuan liquidity injection to support the stock market, local government debt management assistance, consumption stimulus in five major cities, and extensive property sector support.\nMIXED SIGNALS IN THAILAND\nIn Thailand, the economy exhibited resilience in the third quarter, with GDP growth reaching 3.0% year-on-year, surpassing market expectations of 2.7% and accelerating from 2.2% in the previous quarter. Key growth drivers included public investment with robust growth of 25.9% as government budget disbursement increased. This component alone contributed 1.8 percentage points to overall GDP growth.\nYet net exports showed mixed signals, growing at a rate of 10.5%, up from 4.7% in the previous quarter, though their contribution to GDP growth moderated to 1.0% from 2.5% because of higher imports. The surge in imports, particularly raw materials and intermediate goods, suggests increasing market penetration by Chinese products.\nLooking ahead, we are concerned that Thailand's economy will face major challenges from global economic headwinds and trade tensions. There are signs of a slowdown in major trading partners that portend an uncertain recovery in key export markets.\nMoreover, the impact of Trump's trade policies could lead to more protectionist measures worldwide. Coupled with the impact of Chinese dumping, this could create significant downside risk for Thai exports going forward.\nNevertheless, we expect two more interest rate cuts by the Bank of Thailand and an increase in government budget disbursement. This may lead to a domestic consumption recovery, which could counter the risk of external headwinds.\nIn terms of investment strategy, investors are advised to prioritise domestic consumption plays and defensive growth sectors such as telecom, tourism, healthcare and retail.\nWe like companies that have earnings growth, with domestic consumption increasing, that are backed by economic stimulus and are defensive by nature. On this basis, our top picks for the first quarter of 2025 are ADVANC, AOT, BCH, CPALL and HMPRO.\nDr Piyasak Manason heads the Investment Strategy Department, INVX-Research Group, at InnovestX Securities\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nHow much do hotel reviews (e.g., TripAdvisor, Google Reviews) influence your accommodation choice?\nVery important, I always check reviews before booking\nSomewhat important, I check reviews if I\u2019m unsure\nNeutral, I don\u2019t pay much attention to reviews\nNot important at all, I don\u2019t check reviews\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nThailand\nInvestment\nUs election\nTrump\nDo you like the content of this article?\n11\n13\nCOMMENT",

The forecast aligns with the petrochemical group's preparation for production and distribution of products during the year-end festival season due to increasing demand expectations. IRPC aims to drive the organisation with innovation and create business intelligence with the Save Overcome Strive (SOS) strategy, while keeping track of the impacts affecting the company to provide solutions to cope with global economic volatility.&nbsp;\nIRPC Public Co., Ltd. (IRPC), led by Terdkiat Prommool, President and CEO, revealed the trend of the crude oil market in Q4 2024, predicting that overall oil demand will increase due to the need for diesel and fuel oil for energy production during winter. Meanwhile, the demand for petrochemical products is expected to improve in preparation for the year-end festival. In addition, China's economic stimulus measures, focusing on building domestic purchasing power, alleviating deflation, and stimulating the real estate sector, have resulted in positive signs for the recovery of the industry.&nbsp;\nHowever, in Q3/2024, crude oil price volatility and uncertainty in the world market, coupled with uncontrollable risk factors from the economic slowdown in China, the United States, and Europe, led to a decline in crude oil prices, which affected the company's performance in Q3/2024. Compared to Q2/2024, IRPC had a net loss of 4.88 billion baht, an increase in losses of 4.15 billion baht, with net sales revenue of 69.96 billion baht, a decrease of 4.10 billion baht or 6%, mainly due to a 10% decrease in average selling prices, in line with the decrease in crude oil prices, despite a 4% increase in sales volume.&nbsp;\nADVERTISEMENT\nOn the petroleum business front, the company's gross profit from refining products at market prices (Market GRM) increased due to higher spreads for base lubricant products compared to the fuel oil price, particularly the spread of asphalt prices which adjusted upwards and domestic demand increased in line with the annual budget. In addition, the petrochemical business saw a gross profit at market prices (Market PTF) increase from the spread of styrenics products and raw materials, which adjusted upwards due to economic stimulus measures in China. This resulted in the company's gross profit from production at market prices (Market GIM) of 3.65 billion baht, or 5.72 USD per barrel, a 5% increase from the previous quarter.&nbsp;\nDue to concerns regarding economic slowdowns in China, the United States, and Europe, crude oil prices fell, causing the company a loss of 3.37 billion baht, or 5.27 USD per barrel in oil stocks, and a reduction in inventory value to net realisable value (NRV) by 1.63 billion baht, or 2.56 USD per barrel. Therefore, the company lost 5 billion baht, or 7.83 USD per barrel in net oil stocks, resulting in EBITDA in Q3/2024 of -4.84 billion baht, compared to EBITDA of 1.44 billion baht in the previous quarter. However, the strong baht caused the company to gain 763 million baht from financial derivatives, 182 million baht from exchange rates on loans, and 575 million baht in oil risk management (not yet realised), but incurred 2.33 billion baht in depreciation and 687 million baht in net finance costs, resulting in a net loss of 4.88 billion baht, an increase of 4.15 billion baht from the previous quarter.&nbsp;\nPrommool continued, \u201cThe company has implemented the SOS (Save Overcome Strive) project to reduce production costs and increase work efficiency through investment and asset management, while closely and continuously monitoring the fluctuations of external factors that affect the company's performance in order to promptly adjust various measures to cope.\u201d&nbsp;\nIRPC is committed to developing and elevating human rights operations, which is part of the goal of driving sustainable business by linking social management with an interest rate risk hedging contract (Social-Linked THOR) with Kasikornbank Public Company Limited to effectively manage financial risks, along with promoting clear and measurable ESG initiatives.&nbsp;\nIn addition, IRPC collaborated with the Innovation One Fund of the Federation of Thai Industries (FTI) to support SMEs and startups, developing \"REINFOXX White Bear Fertilizer\" to enhance sustainability in the agricultural sector.&nbsp;\nWith this commitment, IRPC has received innovation awards such as Best Innovative Company from SET Awards 2024 and four other National Innovation Awards, including: 1. Outstanding Innovative Organisation Award in the Large Enterprise category, awarded to IRPC for applying knowledge, technology, and creativity to create value and sustainable growth at strategic, process, and organisational structure levels. 2. National Innovation Honour Award for the ABS Plastic Pellets from Natural Rubber project, reaffirming IRPC's role as an innovation award recipient for over 10 years. 3. Second Runner-up in the Social and Environmental category for the PP Phthalate Free Products project, an innovation benefiting society and the environment, with outstanding product design and processes. 4. Second Runner-up in the Economic category for the UHMWPE for Battery Separator project, demonstrating the potential to create commercial value and sustainable economic benefits for the country.&nbsp;\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat type of building do you prefer for a condominium?\nHigh-rise (more than 10 floors)\nMid-rise (5-10 floors)\nLow-rise (less than 5 floors)\nNo preference\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nDo you like the content of this article?\n0\n0\nCOMMENT",

The Thai economy has a high level of household debt.\nDespite a nascent rebound, Thailand's economy still faces risks that could prevent it from reaching its growth potential in both the short and long term, say economists, citing elevated household debt, the slow recovery in income among vulnerable segments, and the country's close ties with China in trade and investment.\nAfter recording economic growth of 1.9% in 2023, which fell short of expectations, the Thai economy is strengthening thanks to resilient private demand, a continuing recovery in tourism, and accelerated government budget disbursement.\nGrowth is expected to increase to 2.8% this year and 3.3% in 2025, attributed to accelerated government budget disbursement, including the digital wallet scheme, robust exports and the tourism revival, said the Asean+3 Macroeconomic Research Office (Amro).\nADVERTISEMENT\n\"Tourism is expected to exceed pre-pandemic levels in 2025. Government spending is set to accelerate, with the revised digital wallet scheme set to lift short-term growth,\" Amro's economists said in its 2024 Annual Consultation Report on Thailand.\nHeadline inflation is projected to decline to 0.7% this year from 1.3% in 2023, attributed to energy subsidies and lower prices of food and other essentials. Inflation is expected to rise to 1.5% in 2025 as subsidies are gradually phased out and the economic recovery strengthens.\nRELATED\nbusiness\nStronger branding urged for marketers\nthailand\nMore medicines made free for patients\nHowever, the Amro economists said short-term risks that could dampen growth prospects include potential export weakness, delays in government disbursement and weaker private investment. The high level of household debt and slow recovery in income among vulnerable segments could also pose challenges to consumption and banks' asset quality.\n\"Over the longer term, Thailand faces a public debt sustainability risk and a persistent decline in growth potential. The failure to adapt to digital and decarbonisation trends could render key export sectors uncompetitive, potentially affecting a significant portion of exports in the coming years,\" the Amro economists noted.\nIn the report, which was issued on Nov 26, Amro said policy priorities for the Thai government should include \"securing macro-financial stability and rebuilding policy space in the medium term, as well as revitalising structural transformation for higher growth potential in the long term\".\nThere is room for additional monetary policy easing should economic growth continue to underperform baseline expectations, as the authorities are credited for their efforts to lower household debt and enhance credit guarantee mechanisms, said the Singapore-based think tank.\nTo realise higher long-term growth potential, revitalising economic transformation is key, said the office. This involves improving agricultural productivity, accelerating labour movement from agriculture to more productive sectors, shifting manufacturing towards new growth engines, and unleashing the service sector's potential through infrastructure upgrades, according to Amro.\nThe office suggests Thailand could reach high-income status in 2050 based on the current trajectory. With bold reforms and effective implementation of development plans to lift potential growth, Thailand can achieve high income status by the early 2040s, noted Amro.\nMeanwhile, Kuala Lumpur-based Maybank Investment Banking Group said evolving economic ties with China present challenges for Thai policymakers. Beijing's industrial leadership in certain areas poses existential challenges for regional economies whose economic structure overlaps with China's.\nIn addition, rising global trade tensions may result in high volumes of Chinese products being directed to neighbouring markets, jeopardising both the domestic and export market shares of local players, said the bank.\nThe authorities need to strike a delicate balance between protecting domestic firms and jobs and establishing mutually beneficial ties with Chinese firms, noted Maybank.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat type of house are you most interested in?\nSingle-family home\nTownhouse\nSemi-detached house\nVilla\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nThailand economy\nHousehold debt\nDo you like the content of this article?\n16\n0\nCOMMENT\n(2)",

Amid growing demand from industry, rising carbon emissions from fossil fuel reliance, and the pressing need for sustainable growth, the region has an opportunity to redefine its energy future. Enhanced power cooperation, resource sharing and grid connectivity can pave the way to more inclusive approaches to energy sector development.\nOur recent analysis for Ember -- the energy think-tank we represent -- conveys the need for a robust regional energy supply. This need is driven primarily by demand from data centres and the expansion of manufacturing industries. Currently, there are 1.5 gigawatts of data centres in operation in Asean, over 500 megawatts under construction, and nearly 2GW is being planned. Malaysia's data centre market is projected to grow by 13.9% between 2024 and 2029; Indonesia and Thailand have been attracting data centre investments, largely shifting from Singapore; meanwhile, Asean's manufacturing sector is forecast to grow from US$1.7 to $2.3 trillion between 2018 and 2029.\nIn 2023, Asean's clean energy production failed to keep up with a 3.6% rise in electricity demand, which was entirely met by fossil fuels. That demand is expected to rise by 41% by 2030, based on 2023 levels. If this rise is to be met with renewable energy sources, it will necessitate a three-to-fivefold increase in renewable capacity by 2035. With their costs falling, solar and wind power could be adopted at an accelerated pace in Asean. In 2023, however, only 2.7 terawatt hours of solar capacity was added.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThese developments present a challenge and an opportunity: how can this increased electricity demand align with the region's clean energy ambitions?\nRELATED\nthailand\nThai fishermen's release 'imminent', says Maris\nthailand\nMyanmar minister pushes election plan\nPower of regional interconnectivity\nGrid interconnections within Southeast Asia could drive a more sustainable energy future. Regional solar and wind power complement each other because solar peaks at midday, and wind tends to be stronger at night. Additionally, comparisons of capacity factors (how efficiently a power plant operates compared to its maximum annual potential output) show that in Asean, wind and solar have both seasonal and monthly complementarity. For example, our calculations show that wind power in Laos -- with a capacity factor reaching 33% from January to February and 48% from October to December -- can complement wind power in Thailand and solar power in Peninsular Malaysia and Singapore, both of which achieve up to 20% from March to September. (Solar and wind power commonly have capacity factors of 10-30% since both are dependent on weather conditions.)\nIn the Philippines, Peninsular Malaysia and Singapore, peak electricity consumption is recorded in the daytime, suggesting that a much greater proportion of daytime demand could be met by solar power. All these factors make grid interconnection crucial, facilitating renewable energy sharing between countries with abundant resources and those with limited capacity.\nDespite nearly three decades of discussions regarding the Asean Power Grid, progress has been slow. Out of 18 interconnection plans, only eight have been completed. This has added 7.7GW of cross-border transmission capacity.\nMany of these arrangements are enabled by long-term power purchase agreements for bilateral energy trading. Under these arrangements, Laos has become the leading exporter of hydropower in Southeast Asia: export revenues exceeded $2.3 billion in 2022, with key markets including Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, Singapore and China.\nCurrently, the Laos-Thailand-Malaysia-Singapore power integration project is the only multilateral power trading initiative in Asean that operates through the bloc's power grid. As the Asean Power Grid framework evolves, it will have the potential to boost economic growth, energy security and sustainable practices across the region.\nFurther expansion of solar and wind energy could open up market opportunities in Laos and other countries. Recent advances in power purchase agreements, electricity trading and carbon markets in Vietnam, Malaysia and Thailand could drive further growth.\nTo unlock more revenue from carbon pricing, Asean urgently needs to establish credibility in its methods. This can be done through regulatory implementation of carbon pricing mechanisms and a robust monitoring, reporting and verification system. A consensus on regional emissions-reduction targets can serve as the basis for a framework that equitably distributes that responsibility among Asean countries.\nSeveral Asean countries, including Laos, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam and the Philippines, are in the process of developing or exploring the feasibility of carbon markets and carbon pricing mechanisms. Within the bloc, Singapore has been the only one to implement a carbon tax, introduced in 2019. Indonesia launched an emissions trading system for its power sector in 2023.\nAs they develop their carbon policies, member states could share data and best practices with each other. Revenue from carbon pricing could be used to support sustainable projects and accelerate the energy transition. Transparency not only builds trust among stakeholders, but also attracts investment, creating a virtuous cycle of growth. As it grows, an Asean carbon market could act as a catalyst for low-carbon power development, financing renewable technologies that might have been prohibitively expensive, such as energy storage facilities and offshore wind projects.\nMaking justice the bedrock\nIt is not enough to focus solely on the \"hardware\" of the regional energy transition; there must also be a commitment to the principles of justice. In Asean, calls for an equitable and inclusive energy transition are gaining momentum, led by financiers, policymakers, energy analysts and civil society.\nAsean may lack a region-wide energy transition framework, but individual countries have been incorporating aspects of one into their development plans. In Indonesia, green jobs are an example of this: the country's Ministry of National Development Planning has defined competencies and recruitment standards in its Green Jobs Roadmap, and its Ministry of Manpower outlined plans to support the development of a green workforce in its 2025\u20132029 development plan. This approach identifies essential technical, analytical and policy skills for green roles in a variety of sectors.\nFinancial assistance via just transition mechanisms (like Just Energy Transition Partnerships in Indonesia and Vietnam, and the Asian Development Bank's Energy Transition Mechanism) will be crucial for mainstreaming these plans in regional transition efforts.\nAsean could benefit from establishing its own just transition mechanism to attract funding for community energy projects. Models like the EU's Just Transition Mechanism, or South Africa's Just Energy Transition Funding Platform, offer examples of financial support for regions most affected by the transition, ensuring no one is left behind.\nDefining roles and responsibilities for each government institution and codifying these in legislation or official policy -- for example, by assigning policy design and regulatory compliance to ministerial bodies -- may ensure broad commitment and consistency, even across successive administrations.\nEstablishing a just transition mechanism to support government institutions and then allocating community-based funding could increase social acceptance of clean energy projects. Acceptance and inclusion will be vital in driving the energy transition onwards.\nBeyond energy security, power interconnection between nations fosters cooperation. Deepening ties in this way enables the creation of partnerships that boost regional stability, prosperity and resilience.\nA collective approach will allow Asean countries to leverage their strengths while addressing common challenges. By sharing resources, technology, and expertise, member states can accelerate the transition to clean energy while enhancing their resilience to global energy market fluctuations.\nAsean has a clear path ahead. By acting now, the region can turn today's energy challenges into opportunities and pave the way for a cleaner, more inclusive and prosperous future.\n\u00a9Dialogue Earth\nDinita Setyawati is the Senior Electricity Policy Analyst for Southeast Asia at Ember -- a UK-based energy think tank that aims to accelerate the clean energy transition with data and policy.

Chinese e-marketplaces represent a key market in Asia that is open to foreign sellers.\nThai brands need Chinese-language product catalogues and need to utilise online marketing through official accounts on platforms such as Weibo, Taobao, TikTok (Douyin) and WeChat's mini programmes.\nThey should also promote their products via key opinion leaders and key opinion consumers and engage in real-time selling via cross-border e-commerce, supported by fulfillment centres and distributor/partner representatives in China.\n\"Brands need to monitor comments and reviews regarding quality and services, and make data-driven decisions,\" Ms Kulthirath added.\nShe suggested Thai merchants select influencers that fit with their brands, including influencers who will persuade people to make their first purchase, influencers who love their brands or key opinion customers and influencers who can help them build long-term relationships for customer retention and advocacy.\n\"Expanding into China is not too difficult, but it requires the right steps.\"\nIn China, key opinion leaders live stream and promote sales on a variety of e-commerce platforms, she added.\nFor example, Li Jiaqi, a beauty blogger who has over 65 million followers on Douyin, was able to achieve sales of over 15,000 units of lipstick in just five minutes.\nGreater impact\nShe said the Department of International Trade Promotion uses key global opinion leaders to raise awareness and generate the Thailand Trust Mark symbol.\nHowever, policymakers can implement more impactful moves to promote cross-border e-commerce by establishing a national e-commerce training and certification programme, incentivising innovation via e-commerce startups and provide digital transformation support for small and medium-sized enterprises.\nThey should also create an e-commerce and digital career development fund, and more cross border e-commerce facilitation and regulations.\nMs Kulthirath said to succeed in overseas markets requires the \"3Cs\", beginning with \"Culture\" by embracing and showcasing unique Thai culture as a selling point.\nThe two other Cs are \"Connect\" with customers and partners by using digital tools, and \"Consistency\" through quality and service to build trust and loyalty.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat is your budget range for purchasing a condominium?\nUnder 2 million THB\n2 million - 4 million THB\n4 million - 7 million THB\n7 million - 10 million THB\nOver 10 million THB\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nThai product\nE-commerce\nChina\nDo you like the content of this article?\n7\n37\nCOMMENT\n(4)",

During the implementation of the policy, all Chinese tourists visiting Thailand can enter the country without filling in the entry card.\nOn the same day, Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra said after concluding the cabinet meeting that the cabinet meeting approved the extension submitted by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to \"temporarily cancel the submission of TM.6 entry card for foreigners entering and leaving Thailand from 16 land and waterway inspection stations\" measures, from October 16th, 2024 to April 30th, 2025, for a period of 6 months.\nSince March 1st this year, the visa exemption agreement between China and Thailand has officially come into effect. Non-governmental and business exchanges between China and Thailand have gradually deepened, and the popularity of Chinese tourists visiting Thailand has increased, which has greatly promoted Thailand\u2019s economic recovery. During China's National Day holiday, in order to further attract Chinese tourists, the National Tourism Administration of Thailand launched the \"Hello Month\" activity, and organised special activities for Chinese passports in shopping malls, restaurants, spas and other places. Chinese tourists can enjoy discounts by showing their Chinese passports to cooperating shops with the \"Hello Month\" logo.\nThanks to the convenient entry policy and preferential policies, as of October 6th, the number of Chinese tourists visiting Thailand reached 5.25 million, ranking first in the number of overseas tourists received by Thailand. During the \"Golden Week\" of China\u2019s National Day, more than 160,000 Chinese tourists visited Thailand, an increase of 34% compared with the previous week. The number of direct flights from China to Thailand increased by 70% year-on-year, totalling 1,097 flights. The tourism consumption of Chinese tourists is expected to bring nearly 5 billion baht to Thailand, an increase of 120% over the same period last year.\nRELATED\nthailand\nMulti-family office to allocate over $120 million USD to its Thai and Southeast Asian Private Equity Platform, 9 Basil\nlife\nWhat 2019 brought to Thailand's strongest industry\nIt is reported that the \"cancellation of entry card\" policy approved by the Thai government this time was originally from July 21st, 2017 to October 15th, 2024, but now the period is extended from October 16th, 2024 to April 30th, 2025. This measure hopes to further promote tourism and stimulate the domestic economy by reducing the customs entry clearance process, and provide support for Thailand\u2019s economic recovery.\nThailand\u2019s Minister of Tourism and Sports, Solaon Tiantong, said that Thailand welcomes tourists from all over the world, especially Chinese tourists, and will make every effort to ensure the safety of tourists in Thailand, so that tourists can enjoy a safer and better travel experience.\nOn October 10th, Thailand's prime minister, during the east Asian cooperation leaders series meeting, offered warm congratulations on the 75th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. She noted that 2025 marks the 50th anniversary of China-Thailand diplomatic relations and said that Thailand is willing to celebrate with China, and promote further close exchanges and various fields of mutual benefit.\nAt the same time, the prime minister said that Thailand will continue to implement visa-free measures for China, increase the number of flights, enhance the chances for Chinese students to win scholarships, provide more convenience for tourists and business travellers, promote people-to-people exchanges and cooperation between the two countries, and continuously promote the building of a Thai-China community with a shared future. The prime minister said Thailand is ready to strengthen communication and coordination with China within multilateral frameworks such as ASEAN and Lancang-Mekong Cooperation, jointly promote trade and investment liberalisation and facilitation, and safeguard regional peace, stability and prosperity.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat is your budget range for renting a condominium?\nUnder 10,000 THB/month\n10,000 - 20,000 THB/month\n20,000 - 40,000 THB/month\n40,000 - 60,000 THB/month\nOver 60,000 THB/month\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nDo you like the content of this article?\n10\n36",

(Reuters photo)\nSeven takeaways from the Vientiane summit will lay the groundwork for boosting the incoming Asean chair's profile and deliverability. These impetuses mean Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim will have his work cut out in heralding a new era of \"Future Ready Asean\".\nIndeed, \"Future Ready Asean\" will be the new buzzword that will be vibrating throughout the region after the announcement of the Asean Vision 2045 in May of next year. Due to an extraordinarily volatile global landscape and pressing economic and social challenges on the home front, Asean is increasingly focused on strengthening centrality, integration, external relations, and overall preparedness.\nFirst, Asean needs a unified voice on geopolitics. During the retreat last week, the Asean leaders underscored the need to maintain a unified stance on global issues, especially those escalating tensions between global powers. As the US-China rivalry intensifies, the regional bloc must speak with one voice to safeguard its interests and relevance.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe inclusion of Timor-Leste's Prime Minister Xanana Gusmao, head of the world's youngest democracy, in the Asean retreat highlighted the bloc's commitment to reinforcing its geopolitical posture on critical concerns, including the East-West divide.\nAt 57, Asean can no longer avoid addressing geopolitical issues, particularly those involving international rules-based sovereignty and regional peace. Historically, Asean has pursued a balancing strategy in its relations with major powers like the US and China. But the growing competition between both threatens to pull the region into a tug-of-war. The Asean leaders are clearheaded and agree that Asean must stay neutral and be more assertive to avoid being trapped in this rivalry.\nRELATED\nopinion\nElon Musk and his US$2 trillion fiscal fantasy\nopinion\nRegional antidotes to counter Trump\nSecond, Asean's expansion must admit Timor-Leste as the 11th member next year. Since its independence in 1999, this small nation has expressed a strong desire to join Asean. President Ramos-Horta said his country would ideally become a full-fledged Asean member next year.\nTwo days before the country was admitted to the World Trade Organization (WTO) on Aug 30, Timor-Leste submitted a self-assessment to the Asean Secretariat. The diplomatic notes stated its readiness to accede immediately to the 66 Asean economic agreements listed in priority one. The other two comprise 48 agreements in priority two and 106 agreements in priority three, to which it will accede within two years and five years, respectively.\nSome Asean members want to defer the admission until all criteria in the roadmap are fulfilled, including capacity-building and human resources. That was understandable as they were not happy with Dili's instant emphasis on its democratic rather than its economic and other credentials to qualify for membership.\nHowever, including Timor-Leste will help Asean expand and reinforce its unity, adding to the bloc's political and economic strength.\nThird, Asean must further strengthen multilateralism and economic integration. By 2030, the Asean Community will become the world's fourth-largest economy. It is important that there should be deeper economic integration especially intra-trade among members. Between 2019-2023, intra-Asean trade averaged around 21.7%.\nTo strengthen supply chain resilience, Asean is upgrading its trade-in goods agreement to include digital trade, decarbonisation, and a circular economy. At present, the bloc's single window has integrated the national single window of the member countries.\nThe capacity of regional micro, small, and medium enterprises will be further enhanced as they generate 85% of employment and 18% of national exports. Asean is coming out with the Asean Digital Economic Framework next year, which will be the world's first such agreement.\nIn addition, the Asean-led Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), the world's largest free trade agreement, is expanding. Hong Kong, Sri Lanka, and Chile have applied to join the RCEP. Asean will soon complete the upgrade of Asean-China Free Trade Agreement 3.0. When they met recently in Vientiane, they could not conclude on the trade in goods and investment. They hope to round off the upgraded trade deal soon. India faces a similar challenge. Furthermore, Asean is in discussions with Canada on its first free trade agreement in North America.\nAsean will continue to upgrade its various free trade agreements with dialogue partners. The bloc's ability to adapt to the changing global economic environment will be crucial to sustaining its growth trajectory. Future-ready Asean needs multi-partnerships to improve domestic manufacturing capabilities and export higher-value products.\nFourth, Asean must engage and manage the US-China rivalry. No other bilateral ties impact Asean's well-being more than US-China relations. Any fallout from their competition could reverberate throughout the region. When the two superpowers were on good terms, Asean benefitted greatly, as both are important markets and sources of digital and green technology, moving beyond infrastructure projects.\nAs such, the bloc must position itself as a bridge between the two powers. Thailand's recent efforts in hosting the US-China meetings showed that Asean could play a constructive role in facilitating communication and easing existing tensions. One cardinal rule to which the Asean leaders consented is that Asean must resist taking sides in disputes, maintaining its strategic autonomy.\nFortunately, Asean's ties with both superpowers remain strong. Each member has its channels for engaging with the US and China, which is why their leaders consistently attend Asean's annual summits.\nFifth, Asean must continue its proactive engagement with Myanmar. The bloc's ultimate aim is to help the Myanmar stakeholders achieve peace and stability. It is imperative that Asean stays engaged with all conflicting parties, including dialogue partners. Of late, the State Administration Council has shown a willingness to negotiate with all resistance groups.\nAt the Vientiane summits, strong consensus has been made on the increasing role of the Asean Coordinating Center for Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Management (AHA Center) as well as the special envoys for Myanmar. The Five-Point Consensus (5PC) remains the central framework for restoring peace and stability in Myanmar, but progress has been slow since its inception in February 2021.\nThe Asean leaders also supported Thailand's initiative to have the so-called Asean Troika meeting in Bangkok in mid-December to further deliberate on humanitarian assistance plans and confidence building in Myanmar. This meeting will include foreign ministers from past, present, and future Asean chairs, as well as concerned dialogue partners with direct stakes in Myanmar's stability. Specialist UN agencies, such as the World Food Programme, Unicef, and the World Health Organization, will also get involved.\nSixth, Asean has its vision for 2045 as a long-term roadmap. The bloc has completed its long-term vision, encapsulated in the Asean Community's Vision 2045. This vision outlines the bloc's shared future for the next 20 years. All the action plans in the three pillars -- Political-Security Community, Economic Community, and Socio-Cultural Community will be completed in the first quarter of next year, and Malaysia will launch the vision 2045 and its strategic plan at the 46th summit in May.\nNext year also marks the 10th anniversary of the establishment of the Asean Community, which was also launched in Malaysia.\nSeventh, the Asean Outlook on the Indo-Pacific (AOIP) is the bedrock of regional architecture. It promotes a peaceful, open, and rules-based region, ensuring Asean's role as a key player in shaping the future of the Indo-Pacific. Since its announcement in 2019, Asean has been working hard to maintain its central role in the region's security. Regardless of its paucity, the AOIP will help Asean meet challenges.\nThe AOIP offers a way for Asean to avoid taking sides while still engaging with important partners like Japan, India, and Australia. These countries also have their Indo-Pacific strategies and they are aligned with the AOIP.\nFurthermore, Asean has expanded its comprehensive strategic partnership (CSP) to include South Korea this year and New Zealand next year as the seventh CSP. The bloc will continue to link up with key strategic partners who have their Indo-Pacific frameworks, ensuring that Southeast Asia does not become a pawn in the superpowers' geopolitical struggle.\nThese seven takeaways provide critical stepping stones for Asean's incoming chair. In addition, Mr Anwar minced no words in reiterating that Malaysia, as the Asean chair, will be active in engaging dialogue partners and other key regional players to promote Asean's voice and profile. During the handover ceremony, he said the chair will have dialogue and collaboration to champion an open, inclusive, and rule-based regional architecture.\nTo top it all, Malaysia has already identified four strategic thrusts for the chair's agenda namely enhancing trade and investment between Asean members; integrating and connecting economies; forging an inclusive and sustainable future, and transforming the digital future.\nBuilding on the results of the Vientiane summits together with Mr Anwar's stewardship and the new chair's strategic thrusts, Malaysia can guide the Asean's efforts to address pressing regional challenges while maintaining its centrality and further strengthening regional peace, stability, and prosperity.\nKavi Chongkittavorn\nA veteran journalist on regional affairs\nKavi Chongkittavorn is a veteran journalist on regional affairs\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhich app or platform do you usually use to book accommodations?\nBooking.com\nAgoda\nAirbnb\nTrip.com\nTraveloka\nExpedia\nSkyscanner\nDirectly with the accommodation\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nOpinion\nVientiane\nAsean\nMalaysian\nPrime Minister\nAnwar Ibrahim\nGeopolitics\nDo you like the content of this article?\n2\n14\nCOMMENT\n(2)",

close trade ties with Mauritius, while one group representing displaced Chagos Islanders expressed anger they had been shut out of talks.\nADVERTISEMENT\nAds powered by\nBritish Foreign Minister David Lammy said the deal settled the contested sovereignty of the islands, the last British overseas territory in Africa, while ongoing legal challenges had imperilled the long-term future of the Diego Garcia.\nRELATED\nworld\nUS military eyes Australia's Indian Ocean toehold to deter China\nsports\nThai stars gear up for battles in Paris\nHe said the base, whose strategic significance was

strengthen our role in safeguarding global security,\u201d Lammy said in a statement.\nBiden echoed that sentiment, saying Diego Garcia played \u201ca vital role in national, regional, and global security\u201d.\n\u201cIt enables the United States to support operations that demonstrate our shared commitment to regional stability, provide rapid response to crises, and counter some of the most challenging security threats we face,\u201d he said.\n\u2018Decolonisation\u2019\nBritain, which has controlled the region since 1814, detached the Chagos Islands in 1965 from Mauritius \u2014 a former colony that became independent three years later\u2014to create the British Indian Ocean Territory.\nIn the early 1970s, Britain evicted almost 2,000 residents to Mauritius and the Seychelles to make way for an airbase on Diego Garcia, the largest island, which it had leased to the United States in 1966.\nA non-binding resolution in the United Nations General Assembly in 2019 said Britain should give up control of the archipelago after wrongfully forcing the population to leave.\nIn 2016, Britain\u2019s Foreign Ministry extended Diego Garcia\u2019s lease until 2036, and declared the expelled islanders would not be allowed to go back.\nThe new agreement said Mauritius would be free to implement a programme of resettlement on the islands other than Diego Garcia, with the terms left for Port Louis to decide.\n\u201cWe were guided by our conviction to complete the decolonisation of our republic,\u201d Mauritian Prime Minister Pravind Jugnauth said in a televised speech.\nOlivier Bancoult, leader of the Mauritius-based Chagos Refugees Group, said it marked a decisive turning point and an official recognition of the injustices suffered by the Chagossians.\nBut British-based diaspora group Chagossian Voices said it deplored \u201cthe exclusion of the Chagossian community from the negotiations\u201d.\n\u201cChagossians\u2026 remain powerless and voiceless in determining our own future and the future of our homeland,\u201d it said in a statement on Facebook.\n\u2018Dangerous capitulation\u2019\nBritish Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who has said his government would be, in part, defined by a respect for international law after his Labour Party won power in July, had made settling the issue a priority.\nHowever, leading figures in Britain\u2019s opposition Conservative Party, which initially launched the talks while in government, criticised the agreement.\nConservative security spokesman Tom Tugendhat said the deal undermined Britain\u2019s allies and opened the possibility of China gaining a military foothold in the Indian Ocean.\n\u201cThis is a dangerous capitulation that will hand our territory to an ally of Beijing,\u201d Robert Jenrick, the favourite to be the next Conservative leader, said on X.\nDavid Blagden, associate professor of International Security and Strategy at Britain\u2019s University of Exeter, said the deal was a \u201cbig win\u201d for Mauritius.\n\u201cNot only will the UK pay Port Louis for \u2018taking back\u2019 an archipelago it\u2019d never held sovereignty over, but they\u2019ll now be able to extract lots of juicy Chinese aid in exchange for complicating US/UK use of Diego Garcia,\u201d he said on X.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nIf you were to buy real estate in Thailand outside of Bangkok, which area

The expo now serves as an important platform for China and ASEAN member states to carry out further far-reaching economic and trade cooperation in more fields at deeper levels. For example, featured products including Vietnam\u2019s G7 Coffee, Malaysia\u2019s Musang King durians, Thailand\u2019s jasmine rice, and Laos\u2019 beer have entered the Chinese market over the years through the CAEXPO, which are well received by Chinese consumers.&nbsp;\nThe 21\nst\nCAEXPO, with higher quality and efficiency, will build more consensus, deepen mutually beneficial cooperation, and help build a closer China-ASEAN community with a shared future.\nJudging from the preparations, the exhibition will feature the following highlights and initiatives:&nbsp;\nFirst, add new content and showcase achievements of development. Pavilion of Strategic Emerging Industries will be added at this year\u2019s CAEXPO. Centering around fostering new productive forces in light of local conditions, it will showcase the latest developments and technical levels in emerging fields such as digital technology, green and low-carbon development, new energy, and intelligent connected vehicles. In addition, the new ASEAN High-tech Exhibition Zone will showcase high-tech achievements in industries such as massive health, biomedicine, new energy, and IT services from Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia, Cambodia and other countries, thus assisting ASEAN high-tech enterprises in developing markets in China and beyond.&nbsp;\nSecond, focus on pragmatic cooperation and show partners.

For the first time, the members of Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) will be invited to participate in the expo as a whole, and featured products from Kazakhstan and other SCO countries will be unveiled.

The additional day is the open day for the public, so that enterprises can be better oriented to the market and the general public can better feel the results of pragmatic cooperation between China and ASEAN member states. At the same time, we optimize the online CAEXPO, set up a permanent exhibition hall, and coordinate the online and offline exhibition and economic &amp; trade activities during and off the exhibition period that take place inside and outside the exhibition halls, so that the Expo with more service functions stays open throughout the year.&nbsp;\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat is your budget range for purchasing a condominium?\nEkkamai-Thong Lor\nSathorn-Silom\nChidlom-Siam\nBang Na\nChinatown\nAri\nRiverside\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nCAEXPO\nDo you like the content of this article?\n1\n0",

This water infrastructure projects Cambodia as a viable and dynamic little tiger, no longer a war-torn nation. Under Prime Minister Hun Manet's leadership, Cambodia is taking a more proactive stance overall despite facing objections from neighbours like Vietnam that stand to bear the direct impact of this naval logistics scheme.\nWhen finished, the 180km waterway -- 100 metres in width and 5.4 metres in depth -- will connect Phnom Penh Autonomous Port with the Kep coastline at the Gulf of Thailand, Currently, Cambodia relies heavily on using Vietnamese ports for maritime transport, notably that of Cai Mep. The new canal would significantly reduce this dependency, as Cambodian ships now can completely bypass Vietnamese territory.\nLet us be clear: Vietnam-Cambodia relations are very deeply entrenched, and their top echelons are still very closely connected. Their disagreements and anxiety on any issue can only go so far as they still treasure their brotherly relations. As the Khmer Times' editorial recently put it: The Cambodia-Vietnam relationship exemplifies a resilience and dynamic partnership that has withstood the test of time.\nADVERTISEMENT\nAfter all, the current Vietnamese leadership worked together in the security and intelligence fields with their Cambodian counterparts under former prime minister Hun Sen's stewardship. He has also witnessed his Vietnamese colleagues rising through the rank and file over the past four decades.\nFor Vietnam, ties with Cambodia also pivot on its bamboo foreign policy. With a common land and maritime border, both countries need cooperation, not contestation. It is not surprising that new Vietnamese President To Lam is scheduled for a two-day official visit to Cambodia in the coming days after his stopover in the Lao PDR, the current Asean chair.\nRELATED\nworld\nHopes rise for giant catfish revival in Cambodia\nbusiness\nOR eager to sell shares of underperforming businesses\nThe $1.7 billion plan, proposed in May, which aims to connect the Mekong River to Cambodia's coast, has stirred up attention and debate. While Cambodia has remained resolute in moving ahead with the canal, Vietnam has expressed concerns over the potential environmental and economic impacts. So far, other lower riparian countries -- Myanmar, Laos and Thailand -- have been mute over the controversy.\nAs a strategic infrastructure project, the canal will enhance Cambodia's connectivity and reduce reliance on Vietnamese water and ports. Most importantly, it also serves as a signature to former prime minister Hun Sen's legacy. His son, Hun Manet, has described the canal as \"breathing through our own nose\", reflecting his country's aspirations for greater strategic autonomy.\nTo reinforce its determination, Cambodia will celebrate the groundbreaking of the construction site this upcoming Aug 5, which is also the birthday of Hun Sen who has asked the citizens to make noise and organise fireworks displays to mark the occasion. He has also requested pagodas to beat drums to celebrate the auspicious ceremony.\nHalf of the 1.7 billion USD project will be invested by he China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC) under a BOT (build-operate-transfer) contract.\nIndeed, the timing of the construction announcement is very significant as the nascent Manet cabinet has been trying to make its meaningful traction after Hun Manet assumed the prime minister position in September last year. In addition, Cambodia is charting a new course that is more closely aligned with Western countries while maintaining excellent ties with China, Japan, and South Korea.\nThe recent visit by US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin was a case in point. It also signals a shift in US engagement with Cambodia, which has long been neglected due to human rights issues. However, Hun Sen, now President of the Cambodia Senate, is guiding Hun Manet, who graduated from the prestigious US cadet school West Point, to maintain balanced relations with all major powers.\nSince the end of the Cambodian War in the late 1970s, the country has risen from the ashes of deadly conflicts. Now, it has new ambitious plans to build a higher middle-income nation with high technological advancement. It has claimed that its financial sector has adopted the full range of fintech to help build the country up as one of the region's financial hubs.\nAs a lower Mekong riparian country, which controls the southern mouth of the Mekong, Vietnam has repeatedly requested more information and impact assessments, expressing concerns about potential environmental damage and disruptions to water flows. However, Cambodia insists the project will not harm the Mekong. Vietnam's concerns are multifaceted. The country fears the canal could disrupt water flows to the Mekong Delta and its rice basket and impact shipping revenues from trade with Cambodia. In a later case, Phnom Penh argued that given the proximity to Vietnam, its overall economy would benefit from trade, logistics and economic cooperation.\nAccording to Chheang Vannarith, a much-credited political analyst, co-founder and vice-chairman of the Cambodian Institute for Strategic Studies, officials from both countries at various leadership levels have discussed and exchanged views on their concerns. Their mutual understanding has improved. He reiterated that this project is a \"Cambodian-led\" initiative yet thought that the proposed fund of 1.7 billion was too small. Other Cambodian scholars have also rallied behind the plan, but questions remain about long-term feasibility and funding. Additional and diversified funding from local sources and abroad is needed, not just from China.\nThere are also geopolitical worries, as the canal is near the Ream Naval Base. Vietnam and other countries have raised the issues of China's influence, as it is providing funding. Interestingly, during Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh's recent visit to Beijing, their joint statements pledged to further deepen the China-Vietnam comprehensive strategic cooperation partnership and build a community with a shared future that carries strategic significance. China also pledged to help improve Vietnam's connectivity capacity, especially large-scale transport infrastructure for high-speed trains, railways, roads, and border crossings. These have also been similar requests from Cambodia. At the top level, the common interests among these three countries must be aligned. Both Vietnam and Cambodia support China's concept of a community with a shared future.\nTo mitigate tensions and reduce any deficit of trust, former Cambodia's secretary of state at the Foreign Affairs Ministry Pou Sothirak, a distinguished senior fellow at the Cambodian Centre for Regional Studies, posited that increased dialogue, sharing of technical details and cross-border cooperation among riparian states is crucial to addressing shared challenges and reducing the potential for future conflicts. He urged Cambodia to work closely with the Mekong River Commission (MRC) -- an \"...inter-governmental organisation that works directly with the governments of Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, and Vietnam to jointly manage the shared water resources and the sustainable development of the Mekong River\". Calling in a win-win approach, the MRC can help with the technical inputs and identify potential boundary risks early\nAs Cambodia flexes its muscles and asserts its ambitions, the canal is a litmus test for Hun Manet's leadership and his country. The project's success or failure could shape Cambodia's regional influence and relations with its neighbours in the coming years and decades.\nKavi Chongkittavorn\nA veteran journalist on regional affairs\nKavi Chongkittavorn is a veteran journalist on regional affairs\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat type of house are you most interested in?\nSingle-family home\nTownhouse\nSemi-detached house\nVilla\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nCambodia\nEconomy\nCompetitiveness\nDo you like the content of this article?\n32\n77\nCOMMENT\n(5)",

Without revitalising the collective spirit backed by action, the survival of humanity could be at risk.\nOver the past several years, our planet has been through many tribulations -- the Covid-19 pandemic, an ongoing conflict in Europe between Russia and Ukraine, wars and humanitarian crises in the Middle East, Myanmar and African countries, not to mention climate change. New technological advancements such as artificial intelligence (AI), cyberspace, and space technology also pose threats to international order and global trade.\nAll these contemporary challenges show that the world needs a more efficient international rules-based multilateral system. Topics on this matter will be discussed in \"The Summit of the Future: Multilateral Solutions for a Better Tomorrow\" -- a United Nations summit in New York on Sept 22-23. The summit has already been dubbed a \"once-in-a-generation opportunity\" to effect global change in ways that would promote solidarity among the international community and all citizens without leaving anyone behind.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe meeting is expected to provide action plans and solidify collaborations for countries to achieve UN Sustainable Development Goals, which has a deadline of 2030, something that is still found wanting, with only 15% of SDGs being on track.\nAt the summit, national leaders will sign the \"Pact for the Future\", prepared by Germany and Namibia early this year. On May 15, the latest revised draft was circulated for comments. It contained 52 actions under five key chapters touching on sustainable development, peace and security, science and technology, youth and future generations, and global governance. Currently, the draft is being negotiated by UN members.\nAs an active member of the UN, Thailand views the upcoming summit as an opportunity to share some of its best practices and lessons learnt from national and regional experiences. Thailand has contributed ideas and cooperation towards the five chapters outlined by the pact to boost UN authority and the multilateral system.\nThis time around, Thailand wants to do more. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has already held a consultative meeting with stakeholders, including marginalised groups, to gather their input. The meeting's deliberations and outcome will be incorporated and become part of the country's positions and contributions during the summit.\nThe newly appointed Thai permanent representative to the United Nations, Cherdchai Chaivaivid, told the Bangkok Post that the success of the summit would depend on innovative solutions to emerging global challenges. He reiterated that the \"Pact for the Future\", which will be the outcome document signed by the leaders of UN members in September, must be ambitious and visionary, reflecting the views of all countries and stakeholders with a broad consensus. \"Recommended actions must also strengthen the multilateralism system and promote the implementation of existing commitments,\" he added.\nJudging by the country's involvement with various global issues under UN frameworks, Thailand has a lot to say on issues related to sustainable development, sufficiency economy philosophy, global health, peace and security, and climate change, among others. Although the country's records on these endeavours are not perfect, they nonetheless provide some practical ideas for the majority of the UN members to ponder.\nFirst of all, the economic model known as Bio-Circular-Green (BCG) -- coined by the Prayut Chan-o-cha government -- has already gained global recognition since it was adopted at an Apec meeting in Bangkok in 2022. Although the Srettha government has not promoted BCG internationally, it can still be used to promote sustainable development, production and consumption.\nIt must be said that the current Apec chair, Chile, and the former chair, the US, have embraced the BCG model in the Apec measures for sustainable development. Since 2016, Thailand has also served as a coordinator between the UN and Asean for their joint efforts for sustainable development. Concerning the green economy, Thailand has aligned its future cooperation with leading economies such as Japan, China, the UK, and the US to improve green technologies.\nFurthermore, Thailand's experience during the Covid-19 pandemic can be shared as stories of decentralised surveillance systems in public health. Thailand has used village health volunteers in each tambon (district) for three decades, and these volunteers proved to be an indispensable medical resource during the pandemic.\nIn the Thai case, early detection helped to reduce the risk of a wider spread of the disease. The county's 30-baht cure-all health coverage has been hailed by the World Health Organization and the international community. The coverage has also covered millions of migrant workers inside the country. As part of South-South cooperation, Thailand has given funding and know-how to developing countries in Africa and the Pacific Islands in health care.\nThailand has also been active in supporting every UN effort to promote peace and security and full respect for the international rule of law. Notably, issues related to disarmament and empowering women in UN peacekeeping forces have long been advocated. Its voting records at the UN also show Thailand's strong support for the UN Charter and its principles, much to the chagrin of great powers.\nIn addition, Thailand and its Asean colleagues have been ensuring that the region will be a zone of peace and prosperity without the threat of nuclear weapons. Asean-led mechanisms could provide some best practices, especially when it comes to preventive strategies and consensus building. Asean ideals encourage cooperation, not confrontation. Most importantly, it prevents any hegemonic tendency by the great powers.\nAnother important element of the pact will be human rights and social justice. Thailand has a chequered record on these issues. Although Thailand has signed eight of nine international conventions on civil and political rights, the implementation of all these human rights instruments is far from sufficient. Controversies related to Section 112 must be addressed because it involves Thai youth and future generations that will become the country's driving force -- one of the pact's key chapters.\nTo become a leading advocate of the pact, the country's executive and judicial branches must undertake major reforms; otherwise, the country's long-standing efforts and achievements in the rights-based approach will be forgotten. As such, Thailand must leverage the idea of global governance. Otherwise, the country will be forever stuck with the same negative narratives that Thailand is not a democracy and that it disrespects human rights and freedom of expression.\nAll told, Thailand will take an active role along with other colleagues from developing countries to ensure that the pact will be comprehensive and inclusive, which will inspire the UN members and their citizens to implement it.\nKavi Chongkittavorn\nA veteran journalist on regional affairs\nKavi Chongkittavorn is a veteran journalist on regional affairs\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat type of hotel location do you prefer in Thailand?\nBeachfront resorts\nCity-center hotels (close to shopping, restaurants, attractions\nSecluded, nature retreats\nNear airports for convenience\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nGeopolitics\nKavi Chongkittavorn\nDo you like the content of this article?\n2\n21\nCOMMENT\n(12)",

It can mean different things to different people, but broadly, it can be seen as a regional framework that supports Asean's role as the dominant regional platform to overcome common challenges and engage with external powers.\nFor citizens of the Asean community, they know its intrinsic value as it has kept the region stable and resilient throughout its more than five decades of existence.\nIn a fast-changing world, questions are frequently asked about whether the Asean centrality concept should be redefined. Indeed, the concept of Asean centrality was one of the major issues that Asean leaders discussed in the bloc's latest meeting in Hanoi last week.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe discussion on Asean centrality is lively and stimulates questions and even cynicism. At a lunch retreat, Vietnamese scholar Nguyen Hung Son, vice president of the Diplomatic Academy of Vietnam, gave a good account of the evolution of Asean centrality. He said back in the 1980s, when the concept of Asean centrality did not exist, the region was depicted as \"flying geese\", meaning that member states, such as Singapore, the Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia, had the potential to develop quickly.\nRELATED\nopinion\nReconfiguring Asean rights declaration\nbusiness\nHow gold fosters economic growth and prosperity\nIn the following decade, Asean was perceived as a \"driver\" for regional cooperation. Questions were raised about whether it was just a driver and whether the passengers (member states) were setting the direction. No matter what the answer was, Asean would go on to assume that it was in the driver's seat, which helped to drive regional processes. Complaints were also made about there being too many hands on the wheel.\nAs Mr Son observed, when Asean entered the 21st century, the bloc turned itself into a \"central hub\"--akin to an airport able to provide navigation and protection services. But when it came to regional issues that required the bloc's reactions or action, Asean was seen as a \"talk shop\" or the \"Nato\" (no action, talk only) of Asia.\nToday, Asean centrality is recognised for its part in driving high economic growth in the region. But what form will Asean centrality take over the next 20 years?\nAsean is currently wrapping up its new Asean Vision 2045, which envisages a bloc that is future-ready, future-proof, nimble, and agile. In the not-too-distant future, it is projected that the Asean region will become the world's third-most populous region and fourth-largest economy, with a fast-growing middle class that will outweigh the ageing population. Moreover, given its diversity and good connectivity, the region will become an innovative society.\nMr Son said he believes that Asean should be bolder in the future. It should become the leading \"goose\" of growth, a pioneer in green transformation, digital connection and innovative economics. Asean also can be an example of turning contestation and confrontation in the South China Sea into cooperation and connectivity.\nIn addition, Asean can serve as an example of how to successfully address multiple crises, such as climate change and water and food security in the Mekong region, thus providing solutions to other regions.\nOn centrality, Mr Son concluded with a proviso that the concept must not make the bloc complacent; Asean, after all, must not shy away from attempting to lead and shape in future.\nIn retrospect, similar observations were made in 1977 when Asean opened up for dialogue, market access, and assistance with foreign partners.\nAt that time, Asean officials were only concerned about locations and setting agendas. They insisted all meetings be held in an Asean capital and all agendas fixed by the rotational chair and its members. Back then, the Asean centrality concept was merely a procedural affair.\nSubsequent economic cooperation and engagement with the dialogue partners increased the bloc's confidence that its agenda should be further discussed and shared with others. From the 1990s onwards, the bloc has increased Asean-led mechanisms that take in dialogue partners on cooperation on matters related to political/security, economic, social/cultural, and development.\nAt the 9th East Asia Summit in Nay Pyi Taw in 2014, its key agendas were initiated by the US, especially on global health issues and epidemic disease (Ebola).\nBecause Asean aims to be the main driving force in the region and prevent any hegemony from outside, active engagement from dialogue partners such as the Asean Regional Forum, the East Asia Summit, and the Asean Defence Ministerial Meeting is a must. Luckily, Asean is not a military grouping; it only promotes peace-making and peace-keeping. It has never weaponised conflicts, near or far.\nToday, Asean centrality has already gained traction as the great powers, particularly the US, China and EU, continue to woo Asean.\nDuring the first special Asean-US summit in California in February 2016, the Obama administration, for the first time, openly supported the Asean centrality and Asean-led mechanism in the evolving regional architecture. Other dialogue partners such as China, Japan, South Korea, India, Australia and New Zealand have long accepted Asean centrality as a pivotal tool for forging closer cooperation and partnership between the bloc and dialogue partners.\nTo make Asean centrality sustainable and relevant, its members' governments and their lawmakers must show goodwill and implement all Asean agreements and policies in a way that only promotes the bloc's centrality.\nMeanwhile, younger generations also need to be exposed to Asean affairs in a more holistic way, not fragmented as it is currently. For instance, the region's school children should be able to sing the Asean Way, the bloc's anthem. Activities and programmes promoting the Asean identity and strengthening the sense of belonging should be encouraged.\nWith its convening and convincing power, Asean centrality 2.0 can go global and create a milestone, especially the efforts to build a better and peaceful world.\nTaking advantage of the current situation, with the ongoing desire of the US-China to improve their strained relationship, Asean could provide a neutral venue for them or, for that matter, any conflicting parties to exchange views and mend their relationship because the bloc does not take sides.\nKavi Chongkittavorn\nA veteran journalist on regional affairs\nKavi Chongkittavorn is a veteran journalist on regional affairs\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat hotel facilities are most important to you when choosing accommodation?\nSwimming pool\nFitness center\nRestaurants and bars\nMassage and spa\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nAsean\nGeopolitics\nDo you like the content of this article?\n3\n18\nCOMMENT\n(2)",

(Reuters)\nChina\u2019s top diplomat has pledged to further boost security ties with Cambodia during a visit amid concerns over the extended presence of its warships at a naval base on the Gulf of Thailand.\nChina\u2019s Foreign Minister Wang Yi arrived in the neighbouring nation on Sunday for a three-day visit after meeting Indonesian President Joko Widodo in Jakarta days earlier. He told his Cambodian counterpart that the two sides should boost cooperation and to \u201cstrengthen solidarity and cooperation, and tighten the security line for the construction of a China-Cambodia community with a shared future,\u201d according to an official readout.\nThe meeting comes days after the Washington-based Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative published a report showing satellite photos of two Chinese navy ships that appear to have spent four months at Cambodia\u2019s Ream Naval Base. China has helped fund reconstruction at Ream, while the US has said a military facility there would be China\u2019s first overseas base in the Indo-Pacific, something Phnom Penh has repeatedly denied.\nADVERTISEMENT\nAds powered by\nThis extended and exclusive access raises \u201cthe question of whether that presence has now, in fact, been established,\u201d the April 18 report said.\nRELATED\nthailand\nSix arrested over call centre scams in southern Thailand\nsports\nEkanit returns as Thais aim for victory\nAMTI is \u201chyping up maritime issues, attacking and smearing China,\u201d its foreign ministry said in written response to Bloomberg News.

MFA_TOGY\nUlaanbaatar hopes to achieve closer ties with Thailand across the board, Mongolian Foreign Minister Battsetseg Batmunkh said during an exclusive interview with Bangkok Post.\nMs Battsetseg, the third woman to be appointed to the post, is making an official visit to Thailand from today till next Wednesday.\nShe spoke about her life and career, how Mongolia is navigating disruptions and how she envisions closer ties with Thailand amid a raft of geopolitical challenges.\nADVERTISEMENT\nMs Battsetseg said she had dreamed of being a diplomat since her childhood. This led to her obtaining a master's degree in international relations at the National University of Mongolia.\nRELATED\nlife\nNew movies out this week: Nov 7-13\nworld\nJapan PM cancels Central Asia, Mongolia trip over megaquake advisory\nAfter graduating, she established the \"M\u00f6nkhyin \u00fcseg Group\" and served as the chair of its board of directors from 2007\u20132015. Later she served until 2016 as an adviser to the minister of finance.\nFrom 2016\u20132020 she was the vice minister of foreign relations before taking on the role of foreign minister in January 2021.\n\"Over the years, I have gained experience working in diverse governmental organisations, [and] holding various political positions, many of which were closely tied to foreign relations and international cooperation,\" she said.\nMongolia's world view\nThe country's foreign policy was mapped out by the State Great Hural [Parliament] of Mongolia in 2011 as it aimed to pursue a peace-oriented, open, independent and multi-pillared approach, Ms Battsetseg said.\n\"In this regard, we maintain balanced and good neighbourly relations with our two neighbours [China and Russia], as well as close ties and mutually beneficial cooperation with our third neighbours,\" Ms Battsetseg added, referring to other countries in the region.\nShe said Mongolia is an active player in global affairs and has diplomatic relations with all 192 UN member states, as well as the Holy See, the State of Palestine and the European Union.\nMongolia is committed to promoting peace and security not only in the region but throughout the world, Ms Battsetseg said.\nWith its single-state nuclear-weapon-free zone status, the country's commitment to the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and achieving nuclear disarmament has been widely welcomed and supported by the international community, she said.\nThe \"Ulaanbaatar Dialogue on Northeast Asian Security\" initiative was launched in 2013 to address the security challenges in Northeast Asia. This forum has now evolved into a prominent mechanism for governments, international organisations and academia to engage, exchange views and, most importantly, to find common ground for possible solutions.\n\"Last year, we hosted the 8th session of the Ulaanbaatar Dialogue. More than 180 delegates, representing 30 countries and over a dozen organisations, attended the event. A new addition to the conference was the 'UBD Youth Forum' that encouraged young professionals to join the dialogue,\" Ms Battsetseg noted.\nMongolia views the UN peacekeeping operations as one of the important means of maintaining international peace and security, she said.\nIn the two decades that Mongolia has participated in UN peacekeeping, over 20,000 Mongolians have served as \"blue helmets\" in 11 peacekeeping missions in hot spots around the world.\n\"Currently, we are the 19th-largest contributor to UN peacekeeping. In the Northeast and Central Asian region, we are the second-largest troop contributor after China,\" Ms Battsetseg said.\nPromoting gender equality and empowering women and girls, especially those living in rural areas, are also high on the Mongolian government's agenda -- moves that have been taken to the international level.\nMongolia has organised a number of events to further these goals, she said, such as an international conference on strengthening the role of women in peacekeeping in June 2022 and the Female Foreign Ministers' Meeting in June 2023.\n\"For this year, Ulaanbaatar will host the World Women's Forum on August 22\u201323. The forum will focus on the importance of women's empowerment, gender equality, and their participation and leadership in addressing climate change-related issues and the attainment of the SDGs,\" she said, referring to the United Nation's 17 Sustainable Development Goals.\n50 years of P2P exchanges\nDespite Thailand and Mongolia formally establishing ties on March 5, 1974, Ms Battsetseg said their first encounter can be traced back to the 13th or 14th century, to a meeting of their envoys.\nFinding common ground in Buddhism, as well as some elements of their respective cultures and traditions, the two sides were able to lay a strong foundation for the development of ties despite their geographical separation, she said.\nSince the start of democratic reforms in Mongolia in 1990, both countries have witnessed progress and success in various areas of cooperation.\nPeople-to-people exchanges climbed, highlighted by Her Royal Highness Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn's visit to Mongolia in 1992 and a visit by the president of Mongolia, His Excellency Mr P O Chirbat, to Thailand in 1994.\n\"Many other high-level visits followed, adding momentum, enriching the scope of cooperation, and fostering friendly relations between our two countries,\" Ms Battsetseg said.\nAt the same time, the number of Mongolians travelling to Thailand is increasing as both sides have waived visas for ordinary passport holders since 2007 and launched seasonal direct flights.\nThailand is also proving a magnet for Mongolian tourists and especially medical tourists, Ms Battsetseg said.\nIn 2023 over 13,000 Mongolians travelled to Thailand, a notable increase from 8,000 the year before. Conversely, the number of Thai nationals visiting Mongolia in 2023 surpassed 2,000, marking a threefold rise from 2022.\nSetting its sights on welcoming more global adventurers, Ulaanbaatar has declared 2023\u20132025 as \"The Years to Visit Mongolia\", under the rallying call of \"Welcome to Mongolia\".\nFor this campaign, the government eased entry visa rules for travellers from 30 countries and launched an online visa application system that allows citizens from 99 countries to apply for visas easily, ensuring a smooth experience.\nThis promotion has amplified Mongolia's appeal as a top-tier destination, Ms Battsetseg said, and as of December 2023 the country has been witnessing a record influx of tourists.\nAlso, due to the country's expanding network of air connections and enhanced road infrastructure, navigating the vast expanses of Mongolia has become more convenient.\n\"We seek to welcome more Thai tourists to our country so they can experience its natural beauty and the hospitality of the Mongolian people,\" Ms Battsetseg said.\nMutual trade and investment\nAside from the people-to-people connections, both sides are hoping to see more mutual trade and investment.\nMs Battsetseg said a body will foster regular dialogue and expand collaboration across various sectors. A five-year work plan has also been mapped out as a framework that guides cooperation in priority areas.\nMoreover, the two countries have established a Joint Trade Commission which is crucial for expanding trade and economic cooperation, she said.\n\"It is important to keep the momentum of our dynamic cooperation [going],\" she added.\nThe country is seeking to explore new areas of cooperation that align with Mongolia's 2050 Vision and Thailand's Vision 2030, she noted.\nAs Thailand strives to become a leading industrial hub, agricultural research and development that enhances both countries' capabilities in food production could be a new area for cooperation, Ms Battsetseg suggested.\nShe pointed out that Mongolia's expertise in livestock farming could complement Thailand's strengths in crop cultivation and processing.\nAlso, joint efforts to promote organic and sustainable farming practices could open up new markets for agricultural products from both countries, especially in regions with a growing demand for organic food.\n\"Furthermore, we could cooperate in air cargo transportation, as our direct flights from Ulaanbaatar to Bangkok are scheduled to operate year-round starting from this year. Last year alone, 53,000 Mongolians travelled to Bangkok, Phuket and Pattaya, and Thailand was one of the top destinations for Mongolians,\" she added.\nOn top of that, with the increasing demand for digital technology and innovation, Mongolia is keen to collaborate with Thailand in promoting digital innovation and entrepreneurship through exchange programmes, joint hackathons, and startup incubation initiatives.\nIn particular, Ms Battsetseg said, collaborating in financial technology (fintech) could involve sharing expertise in blockchain technology and developing financial services tailored to the needs of both countries.\nFacilitating more interactions between Mongolian and Thai businesses is essential, she said.\nFostering closer ties between the two sides' respective business communities will cause mutual trade and investment to grow, Ms Battsetseg said.\nThis could involve organising more business forums, exchanging business delegations, attending Mongolia's Economic Forum and the region's largest food and beverage trade show, THAIFEX, or other trade shows and exhibitions, and engaging matchmaking events to connect potential partners and facilitate collaboration, she said.\nAt the same time, \"MonGolia, Always Moving\" was launched as this year's tourism campaign.\nMs Battsetseg said that from an economic standpoint it showcases Mongolia's investment prospects while aiming to preserve the country's traditional nomadic culture.\nAt the same time, it serves as an open invitation to ramp up tourism and attract increased investment.\n\"We also look forward to finalising drafts of the pending intergovernmental agreements and treaties that will improve the legal environment. Looking ahead, I am confident that the future of Mongolia-Thailand relations is even brighter.\" Ms Battsetseg said.\nRegional partners\nAmid a series of ongoing global challenges, Ms Battsetseg said Mongolia recognises the importance of solidarity, interconnectedness, cooperation and multilateralism.\nMongolia and Thailand are committed to not only strengthening bilateral cooperation but also to working together at multilateral forums to address issues of shared concern, she added.\nSince the 1990s, Mongolia has pursued a multi-pillar and open foreign policy, actively seeking to integrate into the Asia-Pacific region.\nRecognising the importance of Asean's role in regional integration, Ulaanbaatar acceded to the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation in Southeast Asia in 2005.\nMs Battsetseg said it intends to actively participate in the activities of Asean and its subsidiary bodies moving forward.\nThailand is Mongolia's third-largest trade partner in Southeast Asia.\n\"As we commemorate the historic milestone, I would like to share a quote from the speech of King Rama IX,\" Ms Battsetseg said.\n\"'Friendship between nations is important, but what is more important is people-to-people relations, which can guarantee peace and progress'.\"\n\"I firmly believe in the significance of this statement, as it underscores the paramount importance of fostering connections between individuals as the cornerstone for achieving lasting peace and progress,\" Ms Battsetseg continued.\n\"I am confident that our relationship will continue to flourish, and I look forward to working closely with my Thai counterparts to further strengthen our partnership for the mutual benefit of our countries and people.\"\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat type of condominium are you most interested in?\nStudio\n1-bedroom\n2-bedroom\n3-bedroom\nPenthouse\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nMongolia\nThailand\nTies\nRelations\nDo you like the content of this article?\n18\n3\nCOMMENT\n(1)",

She observed heightened interest from both public and private sectors in several regional countries, recognising it as a key instrument for steering towards a low-carbon future.&nbsp; &nbsp;\nRELATED\nlife\nReimagining education, co-creating lifelong learning for youth and adults\nbusiness\nDeep tech startups spawned\nCarbon pricing serves as a crucial climate tool, incentivising countries to decrease emissions and transition to cleaner technologies. Momentum is building for the adoption of carbon pricing instruments such as carbon taxes, emission trading systems (ETS), and international carbon markets under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement.\nMs Kemp said that Asian carbon markets, particularly in China and India have witnessed rapid growth, with ASEAN countries also making strides towards implementing carbon market mechanisms and infrastructure, such as carbon exchanges. Building up the infrastructure and ecosystem for carbon pricing markets is vital for achieving the goal of net-zero carbon emissions.\nCollaboration among stakeholders, including public and private sectors, as well as academic institutions, will be instrumental in advancing the development of carbon pricing markets. According to Ms Kemp, Singapore and Indonesia are among the first ASEAN countries to have adopted a carbon tax as part of comprehensive decarbonisation pathways.\nShe added that policymakers and regulators play a crucial role in leveraging regulated market infrastructure to ensure integrity and efficiency in carbon markets.\nPolicymakers should further enhance the role of carbon exchanges, marketplaces, and innovation platforms in bolstering market development.\nAdditionally, fostering financial innovation and the creation of financial products and services to enhance liquidity and investment in carbon markets, can unlock greater opportunities. Regional collaboration also plays a pivotal role in promoting carbon markets and advancing efforts to reduce carbon emissions, she said.\n\u201cPublic-private partnerships represent another crucial element in bolstering market development through international and regional collaboration to harmonise regulations and standards across the region,\u201d she said.\nThrough a collaborative initiative involving the World Bank, International Emissions Trading Association, and the Singaporean Government, these partnerships have established the Climate Action Data Trust (CAD), an innovative carbon credit platform to bolster market integrity and streamline registry integration by consolidating all carbon credit projects and data into a unified platform.\nIn a separate panel discussion, Dr. Hao Liang, Associate Professor of Finance and Co-Director at SGFC, discussed the topic of financing transition, noting that businesses are increasingly shifting towards transition finance to help carbon-intensive businesses reduce their carbon emissions.\nSimultaneously, companies and investors have been driven to raise new funds by leveraging green financial instruments and making investments in sustainable assets.\nAccording to Dr. Liang, the market requires over $6 trillion annually for achieving sustainable development goals, and hundreds of billion dollars are needed to help achieve the net-zero carbon goal, while total global assets under management for sustainable investment are projected to reach around $50 trillion by 2025.\nHao Liang said clarity and credibility in regulatory standards will help build up the confidence of the private sector in transforming to transition finance. At the same time, clear regulations would also streamline the reporting procedures for companies to provide information to regulators.\n&nbsp;\u201cThe regulator should let companies know clearly what projects are green or not green, and what\u2019s type of information that companies need to disclose or not,\u201d he said.\nNonetheless, he noted clarity of regulations and standards would help mitigate the risk of greenwashing (the act of making false or misleading statements about the environmental benefits of a product or practice), while at the same time instilling greater trust in directing capital towards legitimate green and transition activities.\nIn December 2023, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) launched the Singapore-Asia Taxonomy for Sustainable Finance (\u201cSingapore-Asia Taxonomy\u201d), the world\u2019s first to pioneer the concept of a \u201ctransition\u201d category, to address Asia's specific needs and facilitate cross-border capital flows into green and transition activities.\nSingapore leads ASEAN in green, social, sustainability, and sustainability-linked bonds and loans, with over S$30 billion worth of such bonds and loans originating from Singapore in 2022. The country also boasts a vibrant carbon service and trading ecosystem, with over 100 firms, the highest concentration in Southeast Asia.\nMoreover, Singapore serves as a key centre for climate risk financing instruments, with catastrophe bond issuances totalling S$2.5 billion over 2021 and 2022, double the total from 2018 to 2020.\nWinston Chow, Professor of Urban Climate, Pillar Lead (Urban Infrastructure), said at the forum on the topic of \u201cClimate Risk: Protecting Ecosystems and Biodiversity\u201d, that biodiversity plays a crucial role in mitigating climate change. Ecosystems and biodiversity are natural carbon sinks, providing so-called nature-based solutions to climate change.\nHe said international collaboration is essential to address climate change and biodiversity loss and achieve sustainable development goals. Government sectors can tackle these challenges through international agreements such as the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, the UN Convention on Biological Diversity, the Paris Agreement, and the Kunming-Montreal Biodiversity Targets.\nIn addition to sharing insights at the forum, SMU develops strategies for policymakers and financial institutions to support Asia's transition to lower carbon emissions.\nThe Singapore Green Finance Centre (SGFC), co-created with the industry to ensure applicability and relevance, encompasses three key themes: transforming businesses by integrating climate-related data and ESG considerations into decision-making, designing policies and new initiatives to enhance the efficiency of green finance markets, and catalysing the development of green finance solutions.\nIn 2023, SMU established the SMU Overseas Centre Bangkok. The Centre aims to strengthen ties with the Thai community through facilitating knowledge exchange, forging partnerships, fostering research collaborations, and supporting professional development.

Through the sessions, the world saw a more vivid image of China, with its steady progress, trailblazing innovation, openness, confidence and solidarity. Now, it expects more opportunities, which are brought about by China's high-quality development.\nChina's economic development is a significant impetus for the global economy. In 2023, China's economy enjoyed an overall upward momentum, with its gross domestic product (GDP) surpassing 126 trillion yuan (603.3 trillion baht), an increase of 5.2% from the year before. The country remains the world's largest driver of development, contributing to over 30% of the world's economic growth.\nAlthough it is facing a range of both domestic and external challenges, China continues to enjoy several distinct advantages -- it has a structured, socialist market economy, a super-sized market that guarantees demand, a fully-fledged industrial supply chain, a high-calibre, labour force and an abundance of entrepreneurs.\nADVERTISEMENT\nAs such, the ongoing trend of economic recovery and long-term growth will not change. In 2024, China's economy will maintain the momentum of development and continue to provide new opportunities that will contribute to the recovery and further development of the global economy.\nRELATED\nbusiness\nThe 3 Cs: Elements of trust every leader needs\nbusiness\nReaching for the sky\nRecent years have seen China's strategic emerging industries rapidly grow. In 2023, exports of the \"new trio\" of modern tech products, namely electric vehicles, lithium-ion batteries and photovoltaic products, achieved a 30% increase. The digital economy witnessed a rapid development, with the 5G penetration rate topping 50%. Achievements in cutting-edge fields of scientific and technological innovation, such as artificial intelligence and quantum technology kept emerging. A new, high-quality productive forces have taken shape, which is strongly boosting further high-quality development.\nThe strategy of opening up for mutual benefit provides valuable opportunities for countries around the world. Despite the rise of de-globalisation internationally, China stays committed to further opening up and firmly upholds globalisation and multilateralism.\nChina has established 22 high-standard pilot free trade zones and further eased requirements for foreign investments. It is aiming to achieve solid progress in high-quality Belt and Road cooperation in an effort to deepen multilateral and bilateral economic cooperation. These include negotiations on building a \"Version 3.0\" of the China-Asean Free Trade Area. All these measures prove that China is continuing to open up.\nComprehensive, democratic consultations inform China's solution to the problems of humanity. During the two sessions, more than 5,000 deputies to the NPC and members of the National Committee of the CPPCC gathered in Beijing to discuss state affairs. In the past year, as a response to the suggestions brought up in the previous two sessions, over 2,000 policies and measures were issued by the State Council, and a number of urgent problems relating to economic and social development have been resolved. It shows how China's system is the broadest, most genuine and most effective democratic model for the Chinese people.\nDemocracy is a common value of humanity and a part of civilisation. Countries can communicate and learn from each other on the basis of mutual respect, but there is no fixed, one-size-fits-all model for democracy. Imposing one's own democratic model on others is akin to trampling on the principles espoused by democracy.\nBuilding a community with a shared future will contribute to world peace and stability. As a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and Minister of Foreign Affairs, Wang Yi, pointed out on the margins of the two sessions, CPC is dedicated not only to pursuing happiness for the Chinese people and rejuvenation for the Chinese nation, but also to promoting human progress and world harmony.\nIn this changing and turbulent international environment, China is committed to an independent foreign policy of peace and will remain a staunch defender of peace, stability and progress. China will focus on building a human community with a shared future, and integrate the development of China with that of the world. Faced with the major issues of the world, China will pool broader international consensus and promote the joint efforts of countries to tackle challenges and achieve common prosperity.\nIn November 2022, President Xi Jinping visited Thailand and the two countries announced the start of a new era of Sino-Thailand relationship with a shared future.\nIn October last year, Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin attended the 3rd Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation in China. Under the strategic guidance of the leaders of the two countries, mutual trust between China and Thailand has continued to grow, practical cooperation has been upgraded, and public support for \"China and Thailand as one family\" has further strengthened.\nThis year will see the 75th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China and the 72nd birthday of His Majesty King Maha Vajiralongkorn. Next year will mark the 50th anniversary of the diplomatic relationship between China and Thailand, when bilateral ties will be standing at a historically new starting point.\nTogether with Thailand, China is committed to implementing the consensus reached by the leaders of the two countries, enhancing the Sino-Thai comprehensive strategic cooperative partnership, and accelerate the building of a China-Thailand community with a shared future to enhance stability, prosperity and sustainability.\nChina will stick to the principle of building a human community with a shared future and share development opportunities with Thailand and other countries in world to jointly build a better future for all!\nHan Zhiqiang is Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the People's Republic of China to the Kingdom of Thailand.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nHow much do hotel reviews (e.g., TripAdvisor, Google Reviews) influence your accommodation choice?\nVery important, I always check reviews before booking\nSomewhat important, I check reviews if I\u2019m unsure\nNeutral, I don\u2019t pay much attention to reviews\nNot important at all, I don\u2019t check reviews\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nDo you like the content of this article?\n0\n8\nCOMMENT\n(2)",

The six riparian countries -- China and other five downstream nations (namely Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Vietnam and Thailand) which are \"enjoying the same river\" -- form a community with a shared future featuring \"equality, sincerity, mutual assistance and kinship\". The Lancang-Mekong Cooperation (LMC) mechanism, named after the river, has been warmly received and responded to by all relevant countries since its initiation.\nThis year marks the 8th anniversary of the establishment of the Lancang-Mekong Cooperation mechanism. Guided by the principles of \"development first, equal consultation, pragmatism and efficiency, and openness and inclusiveness\", the six countries have promoted the LMC since its inception, with the mechanism increasingly becoming an important platform for fostering regional economic integration, maintaining regional peace and stability, and bolstering the well-being of all people in the region.\nThe six countries are dedicated to creating a powerful engine for development. The LMC architecture has been constantly improved, with deepening cooperation in agriculture, production capacity, connectivity, green energy, innovation and other fields. More than 700 Lancang-Mekong Cooperation Special Fund projects have been launched one after another, creating a strong impetus for the economic development of countries in the region.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe six countries are committed to accelerating the construction of a strong shield for common security. Practical cooperation in the field of non-traditional security and law enforcement has been further strengthened, with thorough progress made in ensuring the safety of the Lancang-Mekong region, in combating cross-border online gambling and scams, drug trafficking and other criminal activities, and guaranteeing social stability in the Mekong sub-region for the safety and security of people's lives and property.\nRELATED\nopinion\nNew chapter for Mekong region\nopinion\nMekong River region on more minds\nThe six countries have further improved their relationship through mutual understanding and friendship fostered by the mechanism. People-benefiting projects such as the \"Plan on Lancang-Mekong Water Resources\", the \"LMC Bumper Harvest Projects\", and the \"Green Lancang-Mekong Initiative\" have been successfully implemented. The International Video Week, Media Summit, Think Tank Forum, and the \"Lancang-Mekong Adventure\" press group and other events have produced fruitful results month after month. Tourism cooperation and people-to-people exchanges are making progress every day, and the friendship between the peoples of the six countries being enhanced year after year.\nThailand is a main initiator and important participant of the LMC and, as a co-chair this year, is playing an increasingly prominent role as a partner within the mechanism. In November 2022, President Xi Jinping visited Thailand, and the two countries announced a new era of relationship as a joint community with a shared future. In October last year, Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin visited China and attended the Third Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation. Under the strategic guidance of the leaders of our two countries, the mutual trust between China and Thailand has been deepened, practical cooperation upgraded and as a result, the public support for the concept of \"China and Thailand as one, close family\" has never been more solid.\nThis year marks the 75th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China and the 72nd birthday of King Maha Vajiralongkorn Phra Vajiraklaochaoyuhua of the Kingdom of Thailand. The next year will see the 50th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Thailand, which is when the Chinese-Thai relationship will reach a new milestone.\nChina will firmly implement the principle of \"Amity, Sincerity, Mutual Benefit and Inclusiveness\" in the neighbourhood, as put forward by President Xi Jinping.

This is often referred to as \"fixing a cursed year\". In Thai, \"cursed year\" is Pi Chong, while avoiding bad luck is Kae Chong.\nWat Mangkon Kamalawat, also known as Wat Leng Noei Yi, in the Yaowarat area of Pomprap Sattruphai district, is commonly known as Bangkok's Chinatown.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe holy site ranks as one of the most visited temples in the country, and it is a place where Thais of Chinese descent visit during the Lunar New Year to make merit and perform special rites to exorcise any portents of bad luck.\nRELATED\nopinion\nApril Fools' Day Jokes That Should Be Real\nthailand\nPraying for better times ahead\nThe temple's Cantonese name -- Leng Noei Yi, which means \"dragon lotus temple\", is expected to draw even larger crowds during this year's celebration.\n\"Every year, I come here at least once during the Chinese New Year festival,\" said visitor Kanyarat Heman.\n\"Since we don't really know what will happen to us or our loved ones, making merit and thinking about good things [at the start of the New Year] will at least make us feel more calm,\" she said.\nMaking merit makes her contemplate the mistakes she made in the past year and makes her promise she will not repeat them this year, she said.\nMs Kanyarat said she visits the temple every year because she believes that it is a sacred place -- a notion shared by others who come to make merit and wishes.\n\"This temple is best known as a holy place most suitable for performing the rite to ward off bad luck we're doomed to encounter at some point,\" said Somchai Charusomphon, a 63-year-old visitor.\n\"I come twice a year because I feel good whenever I'm here. It's just for the rite to exorcise my bad fortune,\" he said.\nHe said he has developed a strong bond with the temple as his father was a Chinese migrant who settled here years ago.\nBuilt during the reign of King Rama V, the Chinese Mahayana Buddhist temple sits at the heart of Yaowarat.\n\"Thais and Chinese are more like neighbours, so our temples share certain similarities,\" said Mr Somchai.\nThis year, he brought a friend, Suraphong Sabaichit, who was visiting the temple for the first time.\nMr Suraphong said his first impression was that the temple had beautiful Chinese architecture, which he described as being akin to an interesting art exhibition.\n\"It's much easier to get here now thanks to the access provided by the MRT underground electric train system,\" he said.\n\"And as we no longer have to worry about where to park our car, we have more time to explore Yaowarat and enjoy some of the delicious street food.\"\nTalking talismans\nApart from visiting temples, some Thai-Chinese buy talismans and other New Year gifts to ward off bad luck.\nOne man, who gave his name as Tony, 60, told the Bangkok Post he had recently purchased some dragon-shaped lanterns.\n\"I believe this Year of the Golden Dragon will bring me a big fortune, and I expect good things are in store for me this Lunar New Year,\" he said.\nHe was referring to one of the five elements -- earth, wood, metal (gold), fire and water -- that go alongside the 12 animal signs in the Chinese zodiac.\nSirikarn Ratanopap, 22, said she had snapped up an \"auspicious\" bracelet with a dragon pendant to bring her good luck.\n\"This Chinese New Year, I'm paying my respects to my ancestors who passed away while also enjoying some rest with my family,\" Ms Sirikarn said.\nSiripha Jamrunkit, 22, who also bought a dragon-themed accessory for good fortune, said she believed this would be her lucky year.\nAt the temple, she wished for health and happiness for her family for the year ahead, Ms Siripha said.\nChinese ambassador's greetings\nHan Zhiqiang, the Chinese ambassador to Thailand, sends his best wishes on the auspicious occasion of Chinese New Year.\n\"On the occasion of bidding farewell to the old year and welcoming this new year, I would like to send my sincere blessings and wishes to people in all career fields in Thailand.\"\nIn the past year, China has made strong progress in high-quality development and has achieved outstanding success in modern development as Gross Domestic Product expanded by 5.2% -- contributing more than 30% to global economic growth and remaining the most important mechanism driving the world economy.\nHan Zhiqiang, the Chinese ambassador to Thailand\nIn past years, Chinese diplomacy has played an important role and led the world towards promoting the building of a community with a shared future for humanity. Also in the past years, friendly cooperation between China and Thailand has developed in all areas. A shared future between China and Thailand has become the consensus of the people following President Xi Jinping's historic visit to Thailand in 2022 and after HRH Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn paid her 50th visit to China last year.\nPrime Minister Srettha Thavisin officially visited China just after taking office and worked with China's leaders to draft a new blueprint for developing relations between the two countries. The trade value between the two countries remains at an all-time high. Thai agricultural exports to China continue to grow. The export value of fresh durian alone is worth US$4.6 billion.\nChinese companies' investments in Thailand have developed strongly, contributing to the recovery of the economy after the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. The exchange of people between the two countries has reached nearly 4 million people. At the beginning of 2024, the two countries signed a visa exemption agreement, leading to the \"Visa Free Era\".\n\"We are full of confidence in the bright future of relations between our countries. China and Thailand are not far apart. We are like brothers and sisters. I wish good luck to the Chinese and Thai people. Be happy and healthy,\" he said.\n10 unmissable places for Chinese tourists celebrating Lunar New Year\n1. Chinatown at Yaowarat Road, Bangkok\nWith a history going as far back as a century ago, Yaowarat Road is a perfect area to experience many aspects of local examples of Chinese culture and customs all in one place, including great food and the arts. Full of character and charm, the area has been the home of generations of Chinese Thais.\nIn collaboration with the Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT), the Cultural Division of the Chinese embassy in Thailand, and the Chinese Cultural Centre, the annual Chinese New Year event will be held at Yaowarat Road over the weekend. Among the many activities will be Fujian traditional arts, lion dance performances, and Chinese lamp decoration activities.\n2. Wat Phra Kaeo and the Grand Palace, Bangkok\nThe two royal locations that share the same wall are a perfect antidote to the busyness of the city. Chinese visitors should consider visiting both places in Bangkok as they are rich in Thai traditional art, be it religious architecture or a wall painting based on the&nbsp;Ramayana&nbsp;from Indian literature, which is a huge part of the lives and beliefs of Southeast Asian countries.\nAwareness of what proper apparel should be worn at both places and about the foreigner-rate entrance fee should be considered by those interested in visiting.\n3. A cruise trip along the Chao Phraya River\nChinese visitors can enjoy a cruise trip along the broad river that slowly weaves through the city's heart. Most routes start from the Rama III Bridge and go on to the Rama VII Bridge. If on a night cruise, passengers will see the light displays along Wat Phra Kaeo and the Grand Palace riverfronts. Many cruise agencies offer great deals for tourists, including buffets and musical performances.\n4. Khao San Road, Bangkok\nNot far from Sanam Luang, visitors can take a tour of the \"International Road\" after finishing a cruise trip on the river. Khao San Road is famous among international visitors for its backpacker accommodation and vibrant nightlife where tourists can meet and mingle.\n5. Chatuchak Weekend Market, Bangkok\nFor shopaholics, this market, known locally as JJ Market, is famous for having everything that can be sold in one place, with the most popular being souvenirs, antiques, local goods, and clothing.\nAs the market covers 88.5 rai of area, divided into 27 zones, we suggest visitors decide before the trip whether to shop or just chill out. Price comparisons are also suggested for the shopping experience here, as is price bargaining, in which visitors can expect to see the item price drop by up to 60%.\n6. Train Night Market, Ratchada, Bangkok\nThe Train Night Market is a great location to buy local products and try some of the Thai street foods that the city is famous for. Easy to reach by the MRT, bus or taxi, the market is divided into zones for visitors to enjoy their shopping experience.\n7. Bangkok's department stores\nThe city is well known for its department stores (all with great air-conditioning!), such as Siam Paragon, CentralWorld, Iconsiam, and Asiatique the Riverfront. They also offer great eating options, including food courts with street food fare.\n8. Damnoen Saduak Floating Market, Ratchaburi\nIf you are interested in a one-day trip outside the city, then this floating market, located west of Bangkok, is an immersive experience with vendors on their boats. Among it all, visitors can enjoy food, including fruits, from the vendors in this riverside community.\n9. Maeklong Railway Market, Samut Songkhram\nThis famous market is also known as&nbsp;Talad Rom&nbsp;Hoop&nbsp;(Flicked Umbrellas Market) because all vendors close their umbrellas when trains pass through. Despite some public concerns over the market's location, it also displays Thai people's independent nature.\n10. The Ancient City, Samut Prakan\nThis spacious recreational park is a great way to experience recreated examples of the country's most famous historic architecture all in one location. Options for getting around the park include using a golf cart, bicycles, a motorised tram or your car. We also suggest visiting the nearby Erawan Museum to complete your trip.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nHow important are environmental sustainability practices (e.g., eco-friendly rooms, waste reduction) when choosing accommodation in Thailand?

The culmination of last year's events saw Vietnam strategically host US President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping within a short interval, symbolising the delicate balance in the Southeast Asian nation's foreign relations.\nADVERTISEMENT\nPositioned between two major powers vying for influence, Vietnam's nuanced approach underscores its adept navigation of geopolitical complexities.\nAs global dynamics evolve, Vietnam's role as a diplomatic fulcrum exemplifies the artistry of its \"bamboo\" strategy, enabling harmonious engagement with competing superpowers. While this \"bamboo diplomacy\" has proven highly effective so far, the lingering uncertainty revolves around the extent to which this strategy will continue to produce favourable outcomes in the days ahead.\nRELATED\nopinion\nVietnam's bamboo diplomacy at play\nbusiness\nTCEB eyes 23m Mice visitors\nAt the recent 32nd National Diplomatic Conference in Hanoi, General Secretary Nguyen Phu Trong highlighted the intrinsic connection between Vietnam's diplomatic tradition and the symbolism of Vietnamese bamboo. Describing this tradition as having \"firm roots\" and \"flexible branches\", Mr Trong emphasised the adaptive and flexible nature of Vietnamese diplomacy.\nRooted in the core principles of being \"firm in objectives, flexible in strategies and tactics\", Vietnam's diplomatic strategy mirrors the resilience and versatility of bamboo. Such a flexible yet firm statecraft underscores Vietnam's ability to navigate a complex geopolitical landscape with steadfast objectives while employing adaptable strategies and tactics.\nThe concept of \"bamboo diplomacy\" was coined by General Secretary Nguyen Phu Trong in 2016 and has become a defining strategy for Vietnam's statecraft since.\nMr Trong, in his second term leading Vietnam's Communist Party, introduced this diplomatic approach to address the challenges of an evolving geopolitical landscape. Since 2021, Vietnam has actively implemented this policy, showcasing a nuanced balancing act.\nA glaring example is its stance on the South China Sea, where Vietnam has been in direct conflict with China. While expressing shared concerns with the US regarding Beijing's assertiveness in the South China Sea, Vietnam maintains substantial economic ties with China. Notably, last year, Vietnam's diplomatic finesse was evident in its unprecedented double upgrade of relations with the US in September, followed by a commitment to forge a \"shared future\" with China in December. This strategic manoeuvring reflects Vietnam's adept use of bamboo diplomacy to secure its interests amidst complex global dynamics.\nIn an era marked by intense great power competition and an uncertain global future, Vietnam stands out as a notable success story in skillfully navigating the delicate balance between rival powers. The intricate dance between major players on the world stage demands extreme diplomatic finesse, and Vietnam has adeptly achieved this delicate equilibrium.\nVietnam strategically embraced the concept of a \"community of shared future\" with China, a move calculated to avoid upsetting Beijing. This diplomatic manoeuvre not only preserved crucial relations with China but, at the same time, Vietnam cautiously navigated the delicate dance of upgrading relations with the US and Japan, well aware of potential repercussions from a watchful China.\nThe US had persistently advocated for this elevation, pressuring Vietnam to choose a strategic timing to avoid provoking Beijing. The timing was crucial to avert Chinese displeasure. During Mr Xi's visit, Hanoi and Beijing inked 36 cooperation agreements spanning infrastructure, trade, and security, underscoring the complex diplomatic landscape where nuanced decisions are vital to maintaining a delicate equilibrium. Vietnam has been skillfully manoeuvring its balancing act, leveraging trade as a pivotal component of its strategy. Despite a historical rivalry, the US now stands as Vietnam's primary export destination, while China remains a crucial partner for imports. With this newfound diplomatic equilibrium, Vietnam, strategically positioned in global supply chains, anticipates a substantial influx of foreign capital.\nIn an era marked by a widening divide between the West and the China-Russia alliance, Vietnam's reliance on \"bamboo diplomacy\" also faces challenges. The emerging Cold War 2 dynamics make bamboo diplomacy harder to implement and appear insufficient to navigate the complexities of this evolving geopolitical landscape.\nAs the conflict in Ukraine reshapes global strategies, Vietnam's bid to maintain neutrality amid superpower rivalries is becoming more complex. The prospect of political shifts in the US, from a Biden administration to a potential return of Donald Trump, adds an element of uncertainty for Vietnam. Congressional displeasure or specific issues could strain Vietnam-US relations, prompting Hanoi to carefully navigate potential obstacles. Against the backdrop of the South China Sea dispute, Vietnam aims to avoid taking sides, maintaining a delicate balance.\nApparently, this stance has a short shelf-life, and it will lose its relevance soon. The existing fabric of global politics is marked by complexity and unpredictability, pointing towards the inevitability of strategic competition among major nations.\nThe imperative for Vietnam lies in adapting to these intricate geopolitical dynamics while safeguarding its national interests. In light of heightened competition between the US and China, Vietnam faces a formidable task, prompting the need for a fresh and adaptable safety net in this era of geopolitical flux.\nIn this multipolar landscape, developing countries face heightened risks, compelling Vietnam and its Southeast Asian counterparts to tread cautiously amid evolving global and regional dynamics.\nImran Khalid is a freelance contributor on international affairs based in Karachi, Pakistan.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat is your budget range for renting a condominium?\nUnder 10,000 THB/month\n10,000 - 20,000 THB/month\n20,000 - 40,000 THB/month\n40,000 - 60,000 THB/month\nOver 60,000 THB/month\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nBamboo diplomacy\nDo you like the content of this article?\n14\n2\nCOMMENT\n(4)",

Others agreed. \"It is all great,\" said another.\nOverall, Mr Xi's two-day visit last week yielded more results beyond trade and investment as both countries have further cemented and boosted their ties to a level never seen before.\nADVERTISEMENT\nDespite their disagreements and disputes, China and Vietnam, for the past 15 years, have managed their friendship quite well, nurturing their unique, comprehensive, strategic cooperative partnership in ways that no other countries could imitate.\nRELATED\nbusiness\nHong Kong airport boosts efforts to lure foreign airlines as it waits on Cathay\nthailand\n30 years of global learning\nThe countries have now attained a trust level to top up relations with a common resolution that they are ready to build a China-Vietnam community of a \"shared future\" that carries strategic significance.\nIn fact, in the Chinese language, Ming yun cong tong ti, has a deeper meaning as it encompasses all future multifaceted developments and engagement as if they are sharing the same destiny.\nReading the 5,978-word joint China-Vietnam statement carefully, one can see the most important paragraph containing 59-words appeared on the front page describing their special mutual relationship.\nThe two sides stress that they are \"good neighbours, good friends, good comrades, and good partners, and both are socialist countries under the leadership of a communist party, with similar political regimes, compatible ideology and beliefs, similar development paths, a shared vision, shared future, and common efforts for happy people and a wealthy and strong country and for the noble cause of peace and progress of mankind\".\nIndeed, such a comprehensive prognosis of bilateral ties is rare these days.\nMr Xi's visit was successful because it came at a time of great fluidity in the geopolitical landscape as countries, big or small, are trying to navigate relations in more balanced ways.\nChina and Vietnam have special relations with the US. It is imperative that these two neighbouring countries understand each other's thinking and understanding of the US ties, as it impacts their bilateral relations. Three months ago, US President Joe Biden was in Hanoi and upgraded their relations to comprehensive strategic cooperative partnership too.\nObviously, at this juncture, both superpowers are courting Vietnam. However, judging from the substantive outcomes of the two-day trip, China and Vietnam wanted their future relations stable and predictable. Truth be told, both socialist neighbours are equally anxious about what will become of their ties with Western countries and democracies in the years to come. They want to avoid any negative spill-over effects. Mr Xi's trip here bore testimony of such a pathway.\nTo understand the dynamics of Chinese-Vietnamese ties within the Asian context, three important points must be discerned:\nFirst, both nations are the two most successful communist countries operating in the capitalist-dominated world. The way they practice and implement their common ideologies has distinguished the two neighbours from the rest of the world. Indeed, their economic progress in the past four decades has dazzled democratic and capitalistic allies and friends. Their pragmatism has brought prosperity and stability to their people. Indeed, their combined economic and strategic clouts have already left strong impressions in the regional and global community.\nSecondly, apart from a shared Marxist ideology, the two countries also share common borders, history, tradition, culture, and language, with their bond and friendship dating back thousands of years. One has to live in Vietnam to realise that Chinese-Vietnamese relations have deeper roots and are intertwined beyond what the conventional knowledge holds.\nThirdly, more than officials would like to admit, their \"shared future\" will be stronger and more sustainable if they can further support each other and strengthen their cooperation in all areas. In other words, with the new resolutions enshrined in the joint statement they have the toolkit needed to deepen ties and avoid harming each other. Under current circumstances, with their socialist systems imbued with Chinese and Vietnamese characteristics, either side can afford a backsliding of fraternal ties.\nBeijing and Hanoi last week signed 36 agreements that will bolster cooperation in fields including crime prevention, multilateral trade, transportation and digital economy, cyber security, and telecoms, among others. The two sides called for cooperation between Vietnam's \"Two Corridors, One Belt\" framework for connectivity with China's Belt and Road infrastructure development programme. Furthermore, the two leaders also signed a memorandum of understanding on enhancing cooperation in the digital economy and digital data.\nAs far as the region is concerned, Vietnam's support of China's three global initiatives -- Global Security Initiative (GSI), Global Developmental Initiative, and Global Civilization Initiative -- is very significant as it will have a positive impact on Asean.\nOverall, Asean supports the development and civil proposals. However, several Asean members have yet to endorse the GSI as some of them have agreed to do further studies.\nDuring the discussion over maritime and territorial disputes, both countries stressed the need to better manage and actively address differences at sea. It was also important to note that the two countries would actively seek basic and long-term solutions acceptable to both sides under the framework of the China-Vietnam agreement on basic principles guiding the settlement of sea-related issues and international law, including the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.\nFurthermore, the two countries agreed to implement the Declaration of the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea, which Vietnam calls the East Sea. Besides the maritime disputes, both sides also discussed how to combat phone scammers as well as further cooperation in cyber security.\nIn his signed article in the Nhan Dan Daily, Mr Xi described China-Vietnam ties, reiterating that regardless of the changes in the global environment, their countries have worked together to protect peace and tranquillity, pursue development and cooperation, and promote prosperity and progress. All things considered, from now on, their ties will be more forward-looking and strategic.\nKavi Chongkittavorn\nA veteran journalist on regional affairs\nKavi Chongkittavorn is a veteran journalist on regional affairs\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat type of building do you prefer for a condominium?\nHigh-rise (more than 10 floors)\nMid-rise (5-10 floors)\nLow-rise (less than 5 floors)\nNo preference\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nGeopolitics\nDo you like the content of this article?\n4\n13\nCOMMENT\n(8)",

On this momentous occasion, we extend heartfelt greetings to the Turkish community in Thailand and the Thai Nation.\nPUBLISHED : 29 Oct 2023 at 08:00\n&nbsp; Small\n&nbsp; Medium\n&nbsp; Large\n1\nH.E. Mr. Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, President of the Republic of T\u00fcrkiye\nThe Republic of T\u00fcrkiye was founded on October 29, 1923, under the visionary leadership of our esteemed founder and the first President, Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk, hailed as the Father of the Turks. Following the triumphant conclusion of the War of Independence, Atat\u00fcrk embarked on a transformative journey, modernising the nation through revolutionary reforms. Over the past century, T\u00fcrkiye has undergone a profound metamorphosis, emerging as a modern, dynamic, and influential global player. This century has witnessed the establishment of a robust democracy, the evolution of a diverse and dynamic economy, and the promotion of education and culture.\nT\u00fcrkiye's Visionary Century\nAs we embark on T\u00fcrkiye's \"Century of T\u00fcrkiye,\" a visionary concept introduced by President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, our nation aspires to propel itself forward with renewed vigour and enthusiasm, building on the achievements of the past century. In a world marked by rapid geopolitical shifts and mounting global challenges, we are committed to fostering peace and security, strengthening international relations, promoting prosperity, and advancing our global objectives\u2014cornerstones of Turkish foreign policy in this new century.\nPursuing these goals and guided by our enduring objective, \"Peace at home, peace in the world,\" as articulated by the founder of our Republic, Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk, T\u00fcrkiye pursues an enterprising and humanitarian foreign policy. Drawing strength from our geographical location, rich historical heritage, robust institutions, skilled human resources, and dynamic economy, our comprehensive foreign policy encompasses political, economic, cultural, and multilateral dimensions.\nRELATED\nthailand\nTHAI to fly to Istanbul from Dec 1\nlife\nGuru Weekly's Buzz: Sept 8-14\nH.E. Ms. Serap Ersoy, Ambassador of the Republic of T\u00fcrkiye to Thailand\nGlobal Cooperation in a Complex World\nWithin this framework, T\u00fcrkiye has cultivated an extensive global network of cooperation, including High-Level Cooperation Councils with 30 countries, four Intergovernmental Summits, and numerous trilateral and multilateral regional initiatives. Our close ties extend to regions including the Balkans, the Middle East, North Africa, Southern Caucasus, South and Central Asia, and beyond. T\u00fcrkiye's \"Asia Anew\" initiative, launched in 2019, underscores our commitment to developing comprehensive relations with Asia and the Pacific, home to rising powers in the 21st century. We have expanded our presence in ASEAN countries, fostering strategic relations and seeking to harmonise China's Belt and Road Initiative with our Middle Corridor Initiative.\nWe also remain committed to strengthening our strategic relations with Europe, with EU membership as a strategic priority. T\u00fcrkiye maintains a vital partnership with the United States as a NATO ally, contributing significantly to security and prosperity in Europe. Our role as an energy hub and transit country further underscores our importance in European and global energy security.\nAdditionally, T\u00fcrkiye supports regional ownership and solutions for regional challenges, participating actively in various regional organisations and initiatives. In today's complex world, addressing global challenges necessitates collective efforts through cooperation and effective multilateralism, a philosophy that guides T\u00fcrkiye's active diplomacy within multilateral forums. We advocate for diplomacy over confrontation, dialogue over discord, and engagement over isolation, exemplified by our mediating role in several international conflicts. T\u00fcrkiye's active involvement in organisations such as G-20, the UN Security Council, and our advocacy for UN reform demonstrates our commitment to global peace, stability, and security.\nMustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk, founder and the first President of the Republic of T\u00fcrkiye\nT\u00fcrkiye's Compassion and Aid to the World\nAs we celebrate our centenary, T\u00fcrkiye remains dedicated to shaping a brighter and more prosperous future, fostering global cooperation, and advocating for the betterment of humanity through diplomacy, dialogue, and collaboration within the international community.\nIn addition to our enterprising foreign policy, the human element remains central to our endeavours. T\u00fcrkiye has embraced its role as a compassionate global power, exemplified by our response during the coronavirus pandemic, where we extended assistance to 160 countries and 12 international organisations. This underscores the humanitarian dimension of our foreign policy. Our commitment to humanity extends to our developmental and humanitarian aid programs, where T\u00fcrkiye stands as the world's largest humanitarian donor, with the highest per capita humanitarian spending. T\u00fcrkiye also holds the distinction of being the world's top host country for refugees, providing sanctuary to over 3.4 million Syrians under temporary protection. Our humanitarian efforts reach far beyond our borders, encompassing regions like Somalia, Yemen, and the Rohingya Refugee crisis. Through agencies like the Turkish Cooperation and Coordination Agency (TIKA) and the Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency (AFAD), we offer not only material aid but also healthcare and education, reflecting our commitment to global welfare.\nCultural Bridges and Shared Heritage\nT\u00fcrkiye's rich cultural heritage serves as a bridge between civilizations, fostering dialogue, understanding, and cooperation among nations. Our enterprising foreign policy extends beyond political spheres, touching the hearts and minds of individuals, nurturing a shared sense of humanity and mutual respect among diverse populations.\nAs we embark on the \"Century of T\u00fcrkiye,\" our determination grows stronger. We will continue to be a beacon of stability, working towards a world that is prosperous, peaceful, and just. This journey entails forging partnerships, promoting dialogue, and, above all, safeguarding the principles of humanity.\nThailand and T\u00fcrkiye: 65 Years of Friendship\n2023 also marks another significant occasion: the 65th anniversary of diplomatic relations between the Republic of T\u00fcrkiye and the Kingdom of Thailand. As we commemorate this milestone, it is an opportune moment to reflect on the journey that our nations have undertaken since 1958.\nThe bond between T\u00fcrkiye and Thailand is characterised by mutual respect, growing economic collaborations, cultural exchanges, shared values, and a common vision for regional peace and stability. This anniversary offers both countries the chance not only to celebrate their shared history but also to chart paths for future collaboration across various sectors.\nFormalising diplomatic relations in 1958 laid the foundation for a fruitful relationship that has spanned over six decades. However, interactions date back to the 19th century when Prince Damrong visited Istanbul on his way to continental Europe, establishing warm relations with Ottoman Sultan Abdulhamid II.\nSince the establishment of diplomatic relations, both nations have cooperated closely across numerous fronts, embracing diverse cultures, traditions, and values. T\u00fcrkiye and Thailand maintain friendly relations founded on partnership and mutual benefit. High-level visits have been pivotal in deepening bilateral ties, with leaders from both countries exchanging visits to bolster cooperation and explore new avenues.\nTo enhance economic cooperation, former Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs H.E. Mr. Don Pramudwinai visited T\u00fcrkiye in January this year, marking the 4th Joint Economic Commission meeting. The discussions encompassed a wide range of areas, reflecting the broad scope of T\u00fcrkiye-Thailand relations. The \"2nd Turkish-Thai Joint Action Plan 2023-2028\" was signed, encompassing various fields of cooperation and aiming to strengthen the partnership.\nT\u00fcrkiye and Thailand, both significant players in their respective regions, have consistently worked to enhance their economic and trade relations over the years. Bilateral trade reached 2.2 billion Dollars in 2022, an all-time high, covering products ranging from agricultural goods to technological and industrial products. Extensive business delegations and trade fairs have played a pivotal role in forging these connections. Favourable investment climates in both countries have facilitated mutual investments, with leading T\u00fcrkiye-based companies such as BEKO, H\u0130DROMEK, KORDSA, Hayat Kimya, Tu\u011fba Dairy, and Farplas investing in Thailand. Conversely, prominent Thai companies, CP and Indorama, have invested in T\u00fcrkiye. We encourage more Thai companies to explore investment opportunities in T\u00fcrkiye, benefiting from its dynamic economy, robust\ninfrastructure, and strategic location as a gateway to Europe, North Africa, the Mediterranean economic zone, and the Middle East. Moreover, Turkish Airlines has increased its daily direct flights between Istanbul and Bangkok to six, and a memorandum of understanding between Turkish Airlines and Thai Airways was signed in August this year, aiming to enhance cooperation through a joint venture operation.\nDigital Opportunities and Emerging Sectors\nWith the digital age reshaping global economies, emerging sectors like technology, renewable energy, green economy, and connectivity present new avenues for collaboration between our nations. The defence industry is also emerging as a promising area for future cooperation. As both countries continue to prioritise economic diplomacy, the prospects for even more significant collaboration in trade, investment, and other sectors are promising. The time is ripe for seizing these opportunities.\nCultural exchanges between T\u00fcrkiye and Thailand have played a pivotal role in fostering mutual understanding and respect for each other's heritage and traditions. Events organised by the Embassy this year, such as culinary festivals, movie screening days, and photo exhibitions commemorating the 65th anniversary of diplomatic relations, have not only promoted friendship but also strengthened people-to-people bonds.\nEducation and People-to-People Connections\nEducation serves as a vital bridge between our nations, with an increasing number of Thai students pursuing their education in T\u00fcrkiye through various scholarship programs. These connections among our young people hold the promise of a brighter future with enhanced collaboration and understanding. We will continue to encourage Thai students to explore educational opportunities in T\u00fcrkiye. In line with our growing relations in the field of education and cultural exchanges, I am pleased to announce that the Maarif Foundation has been working on establishing a school in Thailand. The Maarif Foundation has the exclusive authority to establish schools abroad on behalf of the Turkish government. Additionally, the Yunus Emre Cultural Institute, named after a prominent Turkish folk poet and mystic, plans to open an office at one of Bangkok's esteemed universities, offering Turkish language courses. These educational and cultural exchanges are vital for nurturing people-to-people connections, which form the foundation for enduring international relations.\nMultilateral Collaboration on Global Challenges\nT\u00fcrkiye and Thailand have cooperated in various multilateral platforms, aligning with shared goals in sustainable development, climate change mitigation, and the fight against global inequality, especially within the United Nations. Our collaboration on the international stage reinforces the concept of effective multilateralism and sets an example for cooperative international relations.\nRegional ownership and partnerships are among the most important aspects of enhanced cooperation and dialogue among nations, ensuring security, stability, and increased economic collaboration within their respective regions and beyond. Thailand has played a significant role in ASEAN since its inception, remaining a vital player in regional diplomacy, economic integration, cultural exchange, and security cooperation. With Thailand's support, T\u00fcrkiye has become a Sectoral Dialogue Partner with ASEAN. Recently, the Turkish Grand National Assembly obtained observer status at the ASEAN Inter-Parliamentary Assembly (AIPA). We look forward to expanding our cooperation with ASEAN into new horizons with continued support from friends like Thailand.\nhttps://www.hidromek.com.tr/products\nBuilding Prosperity Through Trade and Investment\nThe 65th anniversary of diplomatic relations between T\u00fcrkiye and Thailand is more than a commemoration of the past; it is a celebration of a future filled with possibilities. The solid foundation built over these six decades serves as a springboard for deeper engagement, not only between our governments but also between our people. In a world grappling with various geopolitical challenges, our bonds of friendship and close cooperation will continue to grow stronger with each passing year. Speaking of friendship and deep ties between our countries, I would like to take this opportunity to express our sincere gratitude once again to their Majesties, the Thai government, the private sector, and the entire Thai nation for their generosity, support, and solidarity with T\u00fcrkiye following the devastating earthquakes that occurred on February 6th in the southern part of our country. The Turkish nation will always cherish this act of friendship in the years to come.\nT\u00fcrkiye will continue to stand out as a reliable and responsible regional and global actor as it embarks on the journey into the \"Century of T\u00fcrkiye.\" Our enterprising and humanitarian foreign policy will persist in securing our national interests while simultaneously contributing to the shared goals of humanity. With these thoughts and sentiments, I commemorate with great joy and pride the 100th anniversary of T\u00fcrkiye's foundation. I also celebrate the 65th anniversary of Turkish-Thai friendship, which I am confident will grow even stronger with time. Long live Turkish-Thai Friendship, Long live the Republic of T\u00fcrkiye.

How much progress has been made so far?\nTen years after its inception, the BRI has become the most popular international public good and one of the largest international cooperation platforms. China has signed more than 200 documents on jointly building the BRI with over 150 countries and more than 30 international organisations.\nOver 90 bilateral cooperation mechanisms have been set up, and more than 3,000 projects are being implemented, mobilising nearly US$1 trillion in investment, and helping lift almost 40 million people out of poverty. The BRI is bringing tangible benefits to the development of participating countries and the improvement of people's livelihoods.\nThailand is located at a crucial point of the BRI and is an important participant and beneficiary. The China-Thailand Railway is a flagship project of the BRI. It will significantly improve the condition of Thailand's railway infrastructure once completed. It will also be connected to the China-Laos Railway, and will bring regional connectivity to a new era.\nThe third \"Belt and Road\" Forum for International Cooperation will be held in Beijing this October. We sincerely invite all partners to this event. Looking ahead, China will work with other countries and international organisations, take \"hard connectivity\" in infrastructure as an important direction, \"soft connectivity\" in rules and standards as an important support, and \"heart connectivity\" with the people of partner countries as an important foundation, to make the BRI high-standard, sustainable and people-centred.\nIs China concerned that efforts and strategies employed by certain Western countries to contain China in the Indo-Pacific region, which have raised global concerns and heightened vigilance, will affect China's strategic partnership policies in the region?\nIt is only natural that the Chinese people strive for a better life and national development through our own hard work. China adheres to peaceful development and pursues a policy of win-win cooperation. China's development is a positive energy for world peace, stability and prosperity. However, out of selfish purposes, a few countries cannot bear China's development.\nIn order to contain China, they even stir up trouble and create conflicts in our region, which jeopardise peace and stability. They use their advantages in the international economic system to launch trade wars and technological blockades, which disrupt global industrial and supply chains, and harm the world economy.\nThe \"Indo-Pacific Strategy\" of the United States is actually a policy tool to contain China. What they have done will certainly arouse serious concern and vigilance among countries in the region and even around the world.\nThere is an ancient Chinese saying that goes: \"A just cause enjoys abundant support while an unjust cause finds little support\". One cannot go against the historical trend. China firmly believes that we have the ability to independently realise Chinese modernisation and the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.\nAny attempt to deprive the Chinese people of their right to pursue a better life or curb China's development will not succeed. In the end, they will only end up shooting themselves in the foot. This is evidenced in the major scientific and technological progress China has made in recent years. China firmly believes the zero-sum mentality and the winner-takes-all hegemony run counter to the trend of history, to the progress of human society, to people's aspiration for peace and development in this region and the world.\nNo matter how it is packaged, no matter how they seduce or coerce, it will only be seen through and cast aside by the countries and people in the region.\nPresident Xi Jinping said in Bangkok last year that countries in our region should uphold international fairness and justice, stay committed to openness and inclusiveness, strive for green and low-carbon development, and bear in mind our shared future, to build an Asia-Pacific of peace and stability, common prosperity, to make it a region that is clean and beautiful, where all are ready to help each other.\nChina is willing to work with countries in Asia and the Pacific to focus on mutually beneficial cooperation, overcome disruptions and sabotage, so as to build an Asia-Pacific community with a shared future and take Asia-Pacific cooperation to a new height.\nHow do you look at the current situation regarding China's economy and can Thailand benefit from China's economic growth?\nSince the beginning of this year, with the sluggish recovery of the world economy as well as the complex and grim external environment, China's economy has also faced some unfavourable factors, but overall it has continued to recover steadily and maintained a long-term positive trend.\nIn the first half of the year, China's GDP grew by 5.5% year-on-year, ranking among the top of world major economies. China's economy has strong resilience, great potential, and huge vitality. It has bright prospects. We are full of confidence in this.\nNow China has entered a new stage of high-quality development. The focus has been shifted from speed to quality. At this stage, the growth rate may stay at 5% to 6% for some time. But if you look at China's total economic volume which accounts for $18 trillion, the annual increase would still amount to $1 trillion.\nAt the same time, China has an institutional advantage from a socialist market economy, a demand advantage from a super-scale market, a supply advantage from a complete industrial system, and a talent advantage from a large number of high-quality workers and entrepreneurs. These are all strong guarantees for China's high-quality economic growth.\nChina is an important engine of world economic growth.\nOver the past 10 years China's contribution to world annual growth has averaged at more than 30%. The International Monetary Fund projects the same level of contribution this year. China will adhere to a high level of opening up.\nWe have the confidence and competence to achieve sustained and healthy economic development. We also have the willingness and ability to share development dividends with other countries around the world, especially neighbouring countries such as Thailand.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat factor most influences your decision to choose a hotel or resort?\nPrice and discounts\nHotel reviews and ratings\nProximity to attractions\nHotel loyalty programs (e.g., points, rewards)\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nSino-Thai\nThai-Chinese\nRelation\nDo you like the content of this article?\n3\n32\nCOMMENT\n(5)",

The US is investigating Thai exports.\nUS producers of crystalline silicon photovoltaic (CSPV) cells and modules submitted petitions on April 24, 2024 to the US Department of Commerce (DOC) and US International Trade Commission (USITC), requesting an anti-dumping (AD) and countervailing duty (CVD) investigation on solar cells and modules imported from four countries in Southeast Asia: Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam.\nThe group alleged the CSPV dumping practices of these countries undercut domestic manufacturing efforts, materially injuring the US solar manufacturing industry.\nOn May 14, in response to the petition, the DOC initiated AD and CVD investigations of solar cells, assembled and unassembled into modules, from these four countries.\nADVERTISEMENT\nOn Oct 4, the US announced preliminary affirmative determinations for the CVD probe, noting that solar cells and modules from Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam are \"being sold, or are likely to be sold\", at less than fair value in the US.\nIn addition, a preliminary affirmative determination was issued for \"whether a countervailable subsidy is being provided with respect to\" those solar cells and modules.\nRELATED\nworld\nChinese President Xi Jinping arrives in Paris with EU trade, Ukraine among hot button issues on table\nworld\nConcerns rise over China's 1 trillion yuan EV, solar, battery exports\nA final determination is scheduled to be released in February or March next year.\nQ: What are CVDs and why is Thailand subject to them for solar cell products?\nCountervailing duties (CVDs), also known as anti-subsidy duties, are trade import duties imposed under the World Trade Organization.\nThey are applied following an investigation that determines a foreign country's subsidies on exports have harmed domestic producers in the importing country.\nThese duties aim to offset or \"countervail\" the subsidies granted by the exporting country for the production or trade of the product.\nAccording to international trade agreements, a subsidy is defined as: a financial contribution, income or price support from the government that confers a benefit tailored to a specific company, industry or region.\nThe petitioner alleged the Thai government subsidised exports of CSPV cells to the US through projects such as the Board of Investment tax incentive projects and China's Belt and Road Initiative.\nQ: How will the US imposition of CVDs on Thai solar cell products affect exports?\nThe US released the preliminary CVD results on Oct 4, with the proposed tariff rates for manufacturers from the four Southeast Asian countries shown on the table.\nThe CVDs for Thai solar cell products were determined to range from 0.14-34.5%.\nThe first figure (0.14%) represents manufacturers that cooperate with the investigation.\nThe figure is below 1%, deemed a \"very low level\" and considered without a subsidy (de minimis), meaning a CVD duty will not be charged.\nThe second figure (34.5%) represents manufacturers that did not cooperate with the investigation, resulting in punitive duties imposed by the DOC.\nThe US plans to impose retroactive duties for up to 90 days at the preliminarily determined rate of subsidy.\nA tariff exemption was previously granted by US presidential order, allowing US renewable energy businesses to continue importing products from existing trading partners.\nUS clean energy investments recently increased, ignited by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. The law offers tax benefits for the business sector and rebates for households to incentivise the installation of clean energy systems, especially solar cell products, to reduce carbon emissions and electricity costs.\nThe impact of the US CVD measures may become evident this year, when US renewable energy operators could consider changing their trade partners to avoid the tariffs.\nThe extent of the impact depends on the timing and results of Thai manufacturers' submission of evidence to the US authorities in the investigation.\nAlthough some Thai solar cell manufacturers may face higher costs for export as a result of CVDs, other producers determined to have not received a subsidy can maintain their competitiveness in the export market.\nTreerat Sirichantaropas, chief executive of New Energy Plus, the distributor of solar panels made by Shanghai-based Jinko Solar Holding, said CVDs would not discourage local manufacturers from exporting solar cells products because they can export low-cost solar panels to markets other than the US.\nHe said the DOC's move is a trade barrier, similar to that imposed on electric vehicles made by Chinese companies.\nHowever, the real concern among Thai solar product manufacturers may not be the CVD probe, but rather tough competition from Chinese rivals, said Mr Treerat.\nQ: How is the Commerce Ministry reacting?\nThe Foreign Trade Department, which protects the interests of exporters, is monitoring the progress of the investigation, said Noppadon Kuntamas, deputy director-general of the department.\nIn collaboration with relevant government agencies and the private sector, the department plans to gather evidence and information to file arguments in its defence against the US allegations, working with legal advisors with extensive trade dispute experience to ensure fairness in international trade competition.\nQ: What should the Thai private sector do in response?\nThai solar cell manufacturers should provide accurate and complete information, evidence and facts to the Foreign Trade Department to protect their interests.\nEntrepreneurs should adjust their business strategies in line with the changing business landscape, in particular trade policy, including developing value-added products and differentiating their products, expanding to other markets to diversify risk, and partnering with foreign companies to access technology and gain a wider distribution network.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat is your budget range for purchasing a house in Thailand?\nUnder 3 million THB\n3 million - 5 million THB\n5 million - 8 million THB\n8 million - 12 million THB\nOver 12 million THB\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nUS solar probe\nSoutheast Asia\nThailand\nCSPV\nDo you like the content of this article?\n24\n12\nCOMMENT\n(9)",

The prime minister stressed the two sides continued to communicate on the issue.\nDuring Friday's meeting, Xi told Sultan Ibrahim that China would like to strengthen connectivity with Malaysia under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) as it pertained to infrastructure.\nThe Chinese leader singled out projects for cooperation, including the construction of a railway along Malaysia's eastern coast and two joint-venture industrial parks in the Chinese city Qinzhou and the Malaysian city Kuantan.\nXi also promised to boost cooperation in agriculture, poverty reduction, new energy and the digital economy.

(Photo: Reuters)\nSince the start of the 21st century, China has shown its desire to recapture its previous position as the world's most powerful and influential nation. Centuries ago, China -- going by the name of the \"Middle Kingdom\" -- was the world's most influential nation until Western European countries arrived on the shores of the Chinese empire in the early 16th century.\nIn addition to being forced to open up the country to foreign trade and Western religions and ideals -- including those that impacted the relationship between the country's ruler and its citizens, by the mid-19th century, China was also confronted by Western military aggression and the imposition of extra-territorial treaties. If that was not enough, China was defeated by Japan, a small island country existing on the fringes of Chinese civilisation. Submission to Japan and Western powers was a double humiliation for China. Loss of pride has subsequently shaped the country's pursuit to regain its top position on the global stage.\nDuring the past five decades, China has developed dramatically, recently becoming the world's second-biggest economy after the United States. The country has relentlessly strived to be the world's number one -- a coveted position that could help it vanquish the \"Century of Humiliation\" and restore its rightful place in the world.\nADVERTISEMENT\nChina's ability to be powerful and influential relies on multiple factors, including strength at home and its rapport throughout the world. Both factors allow China to share ideas and assist other countries in projects that lead to common development, prosperity and security.\nRELATED\nworld\nChinese student loses over B2.3m to Hong Kong scammers who told her to go to Thailand\nworld\nChina says&nbsp;Philippines&nbsp;has 'provoked trouble' in S.China Sea with US backing\nIn terms of its military, China has modernised its armed forces on all fronts -- not only for activities within the planet but also in outer space. The country has become the most powerful state within the Asia-Pacific region through its combination of nuclear weapons, conventional weapons and cyber-space military technologies. Additionally, it has slowly but steadily expanded its military presence from the Western Pacific through the whole of the Pacific and Indian Oceans. It would not be surprising to eventually see the Chinese fleet in the Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea.\nIn terms of trade and investment, China has expanded its impactful presence around the world through the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) by using its Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) to enhance state, investment, and people-to-people contact and exchanges.\nChinese investors and the government have together successfully positioned themselves as a global factory, with Chinese-made products being shipped with monumental scope across all continents, making China the No.1 trading partner of most countries. It has also become the top provider through a combination of grants and concession loans to many developing countries around the world. Loans and grants from China have been used for the construction and modernisation of transport infrastructure such as deep-sea ports and airports, roads, railways and public buildings.\nChina prides itself on its development model, namely a one-party authoritarian system and a mixed economy of state-led enterprises and private companies. China has promoted its model to developing countries in opposition to the Western system of multi-party competition and a market economy.\nAdditionally, China has joined hands with Brazil, Russia, India, and South Africa in forming the Brics group to enhance intra-economic activities, including the creation of the New Development Bank (NDB). Brics membership has been expanding, with multiple countries applying to join.\nTherefore, it could be said that China has been taking on a global leadership role, a challenge to the dominance of Western powers. The country is also providing alternatives for developing countries to end their reliance on the Western world. The AIIB and the NDB, as well as the programme to utilise its national currency instead of the US dollar, is a challenge to international and regional organisations founded by Western countries and alliances such as the World Bank, the IMF, the Group of Seven (G7) and the Asian Development Bank (ADB). In short, developing countries within the Global South, seeking leverage and bargaining chips, have two options -- the West's G7 or Brics.\nDespite the benefits provided by China to the Global South, not everything is roses. Offerings under the BRI and AIIB come with strings attached. There are many stories of countries going bankrupt for defaulting on loans after various infrastructure projects built by China's loans were not fiscally viable. These countries then have to give up authority and ownership to Chinese creditors to clear debts. There have been many accusations and reports of corruption and under-the-table payments that Chinese officials have given to political leaders in countries to accept these loans, although these projects were destined to fail from the start.\nWhen the international community or countries criticise China about these matters, China responds by punishing such countries economically, either through trade embargoes or the prohibition of Chinese tourists, as well as suspension of bilateral cooperative programmes and activities. Such coercive tactics are not limited to developing countries, as the international community has also witnessed similar strategies used against the Philippines and Vietnam in the South China Sea over their overlapping territorial claims, claims by each country that have been upheld in the international court of law.\nIn terms of the environment, China has been criticised for controlling international rivers flowing from it towards the Bay of Bengal and the South China Sea by constantly expanding water and dam projects upstream. These upstream water infrastructure projects allow China to utilise the flow of these essential waters as a proverbial Sword of Damocles over countries downstream.\nIt should be recalled that China previously annexed Tibet and has more or less ended any form of democratic life in Hong Kong, in spite of its agreement with the UK, while also threatening the very survival of Taiwan.\nThe international community is witnessing the two characteristics of China. On the one hand, there is a benevolent China that helps emancipate developing nations in the Global South from the grips of the Western world. On the other hand, there is a China that is aggressive and confrontational, which is not conducive to world peace and common prosperity.\nIn terms of trade, China has been criticised for not acting fairly towards its trading partners and for inducing fear and anxiety.\nChina must dispel this perception. There should be only one Chinese character, that of the kind and attentive \"uncle\" next door.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat type of building do you prefer for a condominium?\nHigh-rise (more than 10 floors)\nMid-rise (5-10 floors)\nLow-rise (less than 5 floors)\nNo preference\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nChina\nGeopolitics\nInvating\nInvate\nTrade\nNegotiation\nDo you like the content of this article?\n18\n81\nCOMMENT\n(28)",

If it is difficult to decipher the country on some fronts, there are other elements which are more accessible. While it might be easy to look at its impressive growth in recent decades as diverging from other global players in key areas, there are other areas which are mutually convergent. From the multidimensional panorama of a complex world -- the \"multiplex\" world, a preferred approach is not to generalise too much but to analyse the specifics of our times for possible confluence.\nChina's current policy and related vision towards the world community can be seen from the communique issued by the national authorities at its Third Plenum gathering in July 2024. It harks back to the earlier Five-Sphere Integrated Plan and Four-Pronged Comprehensive Strategy which project socialism with Chinese characteristics in the economic, political, civil, social and cultural development, based on harmony between societies.\nIn the background for over a decade, its Belt and Road Initiative has been a key player linking up with some 150 countries worldwide through massive infrastructure projects, such as construction of railways, and extractive industries, such as mining in various parts of the world, with Chinese finance and loans undergirding this strategic outreach.\nADVERTISEMENT\nRecently, due to critiques about environmental impacts and debt traps which await various countries borrowing too easily from their counterpart, there is now more consciousness of the need for environmental impact assessment and more rigid financial planning to address the debt issue.\nFor instance, China has now issued green finance guidelines for a more accountable process based on ESG (environmental, social, governance), as well as the opening for grievance mechanisms to accept complaints from affected communities in regard to ecological harm. There have been tens of thousands of cases in the country where communities have lodged complaints against the authorities for environmental damage, such as a key case in Gansu province where a conservation organisation took the local state enterprise to court for failing to use renewable energy -- and won.\nRELATED\nsports\nKunlavut and Pornpawee march into quarter-finals\nthailand\nThailand Debut: JY AIR Redefines Smart Electric Travel&nbsp;\nMore recently, three initiatives emerged to complement that vision: the Global Development Initiative (GDI), the Global Security Initiative (GSI), and, most recently, the Global Civilization Initiative (GCI).\nThe GDI promotes shared values premised on people, with a stronger commitment to address climate change, green development, the digital economy, and connectivity. The GSI calls for sustained security based on respect for national sovereignty and territorial integrity of states, with peaceful dispute settlement through dialogue. It tackles both traditional security (such as armed conflicts) and non-traditional security (such as the drug issue and cybercrime).\nPerhaps the most intriguing initiative is the GCI, which counters the perspective of the \"clash of civilisations\" by projecting inclusiveness among civilisations, unity in diversity, and people-to-people exchanges. It is linked with another phrase that appears in the political discourse: \"the community of common destiny\", anchored on respect for the diversity of civilisations, dialogue, common values, and innovation.\nIn a way, it envisions human rights interaction based on cooperation rather than fragmentation. Of course, all this has to be tested in reality in a multilateral setting to assess the country's substantive respect for human rights, democracy, peace and sustainable development. There is a persistent need to ensure compliance with civil and political rights in concert with economic, social and cultural rights, as well as to broaden the spaces for a variety of stakeholders, including minorities and those who have viewpoints differing from the majority or the administration.\nOn the development of trade and commerce, while it is easy to focus on trade-related conflicts based on inter-state competition and rivalry as China began to grow as a magnum force in these relations, partly as a result of its membership in the World Trade Organization (WTO), the country has been supportive of key developments in building a rules-based trading system.\nIn 2022, it supported the finalisation of the Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies. Basically, this multilateral agreement seeks to regulate harmful fisheries and the subsidies behind them, especially where they are detrimental to the environment and are exploitative of the system; this is best exemplified by action needed against illegal, unreported and unlicensed fishing. It targets action against overfished stocks and has a notification system aiming for transparency, as well as a dispute settlement mechanism.\nThis year's more recent WTO-related Investment Facilitation for Development Agreement is a plurilateral agreement with some but not all members of the WTO joining, and China has been supportive of the development. It aims to reduce paperwork to facilitate investment, thus minimising transaction costs, and promotes cross-border cooperation, even though it does not deal with market access. Its facilitative approach does not delve into the sensitive area of investor-state dispute settlement (between states and foreign investors), and this has to be dealt with by other channels. Yet, the agreement enables countries to act in concert to simplify some of the barriers facing the globalisation of investment and opens the door for more assistance to developing countries.\nThe country has also been supportive of the WTO's dispute settlement mechanism as a whole, even though the appellate process of the latter has been blocked by divergences between international stakeholders. While the country has tried to maximise its access to outside markets as it moves rapidly to a green economy, with an impressive surge of electric vehicles for exports, some importing countries claiming oversupply are imposing tariffs to counter the influx. In that relationship, China still uses the WTO as a means of dispute resolution. Most recently, in the middle of 2024, there was a complaint against the European Union regarding the latter's action against subsidies concerning imported cars. A pervasive issue is thus transparency and fair play, closely linked with the role of state enterprises and related subsidies.\nIn sum, while there are difficulties along the development path, areas of confluence are welcome, particularly with the greater call for a green transition and the economy through peaceful processes with intergenerational implications.\nVitit Muntarbhorn\nChulalongkorn University Professor\nVitit Muntarbhorn is a Professor Emeritus at the Faculty of Law, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand.

Instead, Bangladesh's prime minister resigned and fled to neighbouring India, ending her 15-year-long rule as chaos has engulfed the nation. The army wasted no time stepping in to form an interim government, although what shape that will take is still unclear.\nThe military needs to find a swift path to a peaceful transfer of power. Any delay will risk damaging the country's reputation with the international financial community even further -- at a time when Dhaka needs funds and investment to revive its flailing economy. Stability in a region that has long lived under the shadow of violent extremism is also under threat, while the chaos will present an opportunity for China, whose ambitions have so far been well-balanced against India's under Ms Hasina's regime.\nOnce among the most impoverished countries in the world, Bangladesh witnessed a remarkable turnaround in recent years. A young and energetic workforce helped make it the world's second-largest clothing exporter behind China, manufacturing for large fashion brands like Hennes &amp; Mauritz AB, Gap Inc. and Inditex SA's Zara. In 2022, it was on course to become a US$1 trillion economy by 2040, according to the Boston Consulting Group.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe good times didn't last. A combination of the pandemic and financial mismanagement took their toll on the emerging economy, and two years ago, it reached out to the International Monetary Fund and other international lenders to prevent collapse. It's the third country in the region, after Sri Lanka and Pakistan, forced to knock on the IMF's door in recent times. All the instability is adding to uncertainty in South Asia.\nRELATED\nopinion\nBangladesh's youth uprising has Arab Spring echoes\nworld\nTwelve killed as Bangladesh goes to the polls\nFinancial health was not the only issue. The protests over the last month have been a lightning rod for an array of problems from acute unemployment to a flagging private sector, Lutfey Siddiqi, visiting professor at the London School of Economics' foreign policy think tank, said. \"There's also anger at the sheer lack of empathy and condescension with which Hasina has responded to those worries.\"\nThe prime minister's ruling Awami League has been in power since 2009, but elections have been regularly boycotted by the opposition, and widely condemned as being insufficiently free and fair. She capitalised on a storied legacy as the daughter of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, Bangladesh's founding father, going on to become the world's longest-serving female leader, but in recent years has clamped down on press freedom and quashed public debate. Economic mismanagement has only made grievances worse.\nHer entrance into political life was marked by personal tragedy. Ms Hasina's father was assassinated in a coup in 1975 when she was 28. The army murdered 18 people that day, including her parents and three siblings. Ms Hasina, who was in Germany at the time, fled to India with her sister and lived in exile there until she returned home in the 1980s. She was in and out of home detention until 1996 when she first became prime minister.\nMs Hasina was credited for bringing much-needed stability and turning the economy around. But in the last decade, her rule was marked by protests against an increasingly authoritarian regime. More recently, police launched a brutal crackdown on demonstrators who have been on the streets since June to voice their discontent over a proposed government jobs quota. More than 100 people died last weekend, adding to the toll of at least 300 since citizen anger flared. The rage has morphed into something deeper -- a disillusionment with Ms Hasina's government that many among the 170 million strong population view as corrupt and ineffective. There are regional implications for Ms Hasina's dramatic exit. It puts renewed pressure on India, which has relied on her to keep potential terrorist threats at bay as well as provide a bulwark to China's growing influence in the region. New Delhi will be worried about who will replace her, what that will mean for security risks on its border, and the new government's relations with Beijing.\nChina is Bangladesh's largest trading partner. In 2022, trade between the two grew by 10.7% to $27.79 billion from $12 billion in 2014. Dhaka was the first South Asian country to join the Belt and Road Initiative, Beijing's ambitious global infrastructure programme. In July, Bangladesh asked for a $5 billion loan from Beijing to help it grow its economy. In the current power vacuum, the US will be mindful of China's appeal. American officials have for too long turned a blind eye to Ms Hasina's growing autocracy in an attempt to keep her on side. That could come back to haunt them.\nFor now though, it will be domestic considerations that will dominate -- and rightly so. The country has to begin the difficult process of rebuilding. The first tasks for a new government will be quelling the protests and steadying the economy. Negotiations with the IMF for more funds in the face of dwindling foreign exchange reserves should be a priority.

Malaysia recently began considering extending the route\ncloser to the border\nwith Thailand.\nFirst proposed in 2017 and having undergone numerous changes since then, the 665km rail line will connect the east and west coasts of peninsular Malaysia by the end of 2026. The line is being built by the Malaysian unit of China Communications Construction Co Ltd.\nADVERTISEMENT\nLi is on the second day of a three-day visit to Malaysia, as Beijing looks to deepen ties with a country that has asserted its neutrality amid intensifying rivalry between the US and China.\nThe Chinese premier met with Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim in the administrative capital Putrajaya on Wednesday. They witnessed the signing of several bilateral deals, including for exports of fresh durians from Malaysia to China.\nRELATED\nworld\nHuge illegal drug lab exposed in Syria\nworld\nTaiwan says China's threat towards island has been evolving\nThe agreement would see Malaysia, one of the world\u2019s biggest producers of the pungent fruit, join Southeast Asian neighbours Thailand and Vietnam in shipping fresh durian to the multi-billion-dollar Chinese market. Malaysia was previously allowed to ship only durian products and frozen whole durian to Chinaa.\nIn Thailand:\nDrought puts pressure on durian farmers\nChina and Malaysia also agreed to a plan for economic and trade cooperation that would run through 2028, according to a statement from Anwar\u2019s office. Officials pledged as well to discuss additional visa exemptions \u2014 boosting a mutual visa-free entry policy between the two countries.\nAnwar and Li also agreed that China and relevant Asean countries should independently handle disputes in the South China Sea issue, the Xinhua News Agency reported. Vietnam, the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia and Taiwan claim parts of the same maritime area, and have sparred with China over which claims are valid.\nLi\u2019s arrival marks the first visit by a Chinese premier to the Southeast Asian nation since 2015. It coincides with Anwar\u2019s efforts to maintain ties with both China and the US, while positioning Malaysia as a destination for investment from both powers.\nThe Malaysian leader last month pledged at least 25 billion ringgit ($5.3 billion) to support the country\u2019s semiconductor industry, as the US-China contest shakes up global supply chains.\n\u201cWe refuse to be defined by how major powers see the world.

(Photo: Reuters)\nTensions between the United States and China continue to flare, even as Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, Secretary of State Antony Blinken, and several other senior US officials visit the country for talks. The two sides may disagree on most things, but maintaining dialogue is an essential part of geopolitics. The breakdown in communication last year, following visits to Taiwan by prominent American politicians and the US downing of a Chinese spy balloon, was dangerous and destabilising, because when adversaries do not engage, misperceptions -- and the risk of a clash -- mount.\nBut, midway through 2024, dialogue is proving unable to bridge deep divides. This major superpower conflict looks set to continue and may even worsen as positions on the war in Ukraine, national security concerns, and trade tensions harden into a long-term standoff. Global institutions, forums, and solutions will be among the biggest losers in an ongoing US-China decoupling, while regional alliances will increase in importance.\nSome weakness was evident at the World Bank and International Monetary Fund spring meetings in Washington. The International Monetary and Financial Committee did not issue a communiqu\u00e9, as it normally would, because China and its allies refused to include a reference to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. US and European shareholders, for their part, wanted to recognise the war and its impact. The resulting silence was a victory for both Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe G20 has also become more divided and less effective. In contrast to 2008-09, when G20 leaders quickly forged a coordinated response to the global financial crisis, the group currently lacks the collective will to address crises and achieve common goals. To be sure, the G20 still holds annual summits and technical experts have made progress in some areas. But Russia's invasion of Crimea in 2014 opened fissures in the group, which have only deepened in the years since. Consequently, the G20 is no longer the principal forum for global diplomacy.\nRELATED\nthailand\nEx-PM proposes reforms amid global shifts\nbusiness\nFinnomena touts US, India and Vietnam for investment\nMeanwhile, the enlarged Brics+ forum, an initiative pushed by China, seeks to counter American influence, especially now that the US is caught in what Graham Allison calls the Thucydides Trap -- the tendency towards war when an emerging power threatens to displace a regional or international hegemon.\nBy putting new Brics in the wall -- the group now includes Egypt, Ethiopia, Saudi Arabia, Iran, and the United Arab Emirates, in addition to Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa -- China is trying to build an alternative world order, in which the Global South has greater geopolitical, economic, and diplomatic heft. In 2024, the Brics+ countries account for around 36% of global GDP and 45% of the world's population. While its members do not always -- or even often -- agree, they are shifting power away from the US and its allies, especially in the IMF, the World Bank, the G20, and the United Nations, where they promote China's positions.\nThe expanded group is buttressed by the New Development Bank, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, and huge resource transfers, valued at roughly $1 trillion (36.77 trillion baht), through China's Belt and Road Initiative to partners around the world. These are part of China's efforts to construct its own global financial architecture that will support its goals and compete with the European-led IMF and the US-led World Bank.\nWhether China will succeed in coordinating the Global South is unclear. America certainly hopes not. But others see Brics+ as a new global economic paradigm. The reality is somewhere in between, although the US seems to be falling out of favour.\nTellingly, the US has responded to China's growing might by taking a step backwards and attempting to reinvigorate the G7, an unrepresentative group that is no longer as effective or relevant as it once was. To be sure, a forum for Western allies is necessary. But the notion that a group as small as the G7 can advance global goals at a time of heightened tensions and hardening stances is fanciful. Moreover, the G7 is far from united: despite US pressure, its members have been unable to agree on commandeering Russia's frozen assets.\nWhile the exact impact of the changing geopolitical balance remains unknown, it is clearly becoming an impediment to addressing global challenges, whether related to climate change, migration, disease, or other worldwide crises. We are entering a period of deteriorating US-China relations, with each side backed by its own allies and operating in its own international forums. As the risk of a great-power confrontation increases, the window of opportunity for solving humanity's most pressing problems is closing fast.\n\u00a92024 Project Syndicate\nWilliam R Rhodes, President of William R Rhodes Global Advisers LLC, is the author of 'Banker to the World: Leadership Lessons From the Front Lines of Global Finance' (McGraw Hill, 2011).

(Reuters photo)\nChinese President Xi Jinping arrived in France on Sunday to begin a closely watched three-nation tour that will see him try to improve relations with Europe amid intensifying US rivalry, with trade and Ukraine high on the agenda.\nAccompanying Xi on his first European tour in five years is his wife Peng Liyuan, chief of staff Cai Qi, and Foreign Minister Wang Yi, according to a statement from Beijing. The five-day trip will also take Xi to Serbia and Hungary.\nThe delegation is expected to spend two days in France, with Xi to meet President Emmanuel Macron and the European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen in Paris on Monday, ahead of a state dinner.\nADVERTISEMENT\nAds powered by\nMacron and von der Leyen, who has been invited by the French president to join the meeting with Xi, are expected to bring up some of the thorniest issues in China-EU relations. This includes the bloc's long-standing concerns over a nearly 300 billion euro (US$323 billion) trade deficit and alleged Chinese supplies of dual-use goods to Russia that benefit its military assaults on Ukraine.\nRELATED\nbusiness\nRestaurants worry over New Year disappointment\nbusiness\nThai stock index continues its downward trend\nThe European Union has stepped up its \"de-risking\" approach to address economic overdependence on China, and what it calls Beijing's increasing geopolitical \"assertiveness\" as relations with the West worsen.\nThe drive includes probes targeting China's clean energy industry - where it has emerged as a global leader - involving products including electric vehicles, solar panels and wind turbines, with Beijing accused of \"flooding\" the European market with heavily subsidised cheaper products.\nMacron, who is known for his pro-European approach, is a major supporter of the bloc's tougher economic measures against China. He is also believed to be a proponent of the EU's anti-subsidy probe into Chinese EVs, which has prompted Beijing to retaliate with a similar investigation into French brandy.\nIn an interview to the French newspaper La Tribune published on Saturday, Macron said he would press Xi on economic reciprocity.\n\"In Europe, we are not unanimous on the subject because certain players still see China as essentially a market of opportunities. I'm calling for an 'aggiornamento' because China is now in excess capacity in many areas and exports massively to Europe,\" Macron said, using the Italian word for update.\nMacron added that China's role was crucial on international issues where Europe needed its engagement, whether it was climate change, or security issues concerning Ukraine, North Korea or Iran. Conflicts in the Middle East are also expected to be discussed in the meeting with Xi.\n\"I am not suggesting we move away from China,\" Macron told La Tribune. However, I think that we must better protect our national security, our sovereignty, de-risk a part of our supply chains and be much more realistic in defending our interests.\"\nMacron, a defender of Europe's \"strategic autonomy\" amid the US-China rivalry, is often seen as striking a delicate balance while launching a \"charm offensive\" on China, despite US pressure.\nDuring his visit to China last year, Macron was accompanied by a large business delegation and brought home a number of significant deals in nuclear energy, aviation, and agriculture, even though he was unsuccessful in persuading Xi to jointly act on Russia.\nXi's visit will see France seek to further boost agricultural exports to China, and also repeat the plea for Beijing to use its influence on Moscow, including on negotiating a potential truce during the Paris Olympic Games starting late July, according to Macron and his officials.\nChina has yet to condemn Russia's invasion of Ukraine and is criticised by the West for siding with Moscow due to their close ties. Russian President Vladimir Putin is reportedly due to visit China shortly after Xi returns from Europe.\nChina insists it has a neutral stance in the war and is using its own methods to bring peace to Ukraine, including efforts for direct talks between the two sides at next month's global peace summit in Switzerland.\nOn Tuesday, Macron is expected to bring Xi to the Pyrenees mountains on the Spanish border, a place the French president holds dear as his grandmother's birthplace and where he spent his childhood holidays.\nAccording to French media, the personal gesture aims to echo Xi's decision to host a tea ceremony for Macron at the former residence of his father in southern China.\nIn an opinion piece published on state-run CGTN on Sunday, Chinese envoy to France Lu Shaye said relations with France were \"at the forefront of China's relations with Western countries\". It is hoped France's \"independent\" policy towards China would open up more cooperation while resolving mutual \"differences\" as the two countries mark 60 years of diplomatic ties, Lu wrote.\nChina has long called on the EU to remain strategically independent of US policy, as more members of the 27-nation bloc follow Washington in imposing economic and technological restrictions on China.\nMany see Xi's trip as an attempt by China to regain the trust of Europe, while driving a wedge between the US and its allies as cracks begin to show over US security commitment to Ukraine.\nXi's next stops - the Russia-friendly Serbia and Hungary - both have strained relations with the United States.\nXi's trip to Serbia coincides with the 25th anniversary of the Nato bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade.\nHe also aims to strengthen partnerships with both central European countries under the Belt and Road Initiative, the funding and infrastructure strategy criticised by the West as China's flagship project to reshape the global order.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat is your budget range for renting a condominium?\nUnder 10,000 THB/month\n10,000 - 20,000 THB/month\n20,000 - 40,000 THB/month\n40,000 - 60,000 THB/month\nOver 60,000 THB/month\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nChinese president\nXi\nVisit\nFrance\nEurope\nChina\nUnited States\nRelations\nRivalry\nDo you like the content of this article?\n7\n18\nCOMMENT\n(9)",

Like many infrastructure projects, it could potentially be used for military purposes and is drawing similar concerns from neighbour Vietnam.&nbsp;\nThere are worries that the project could support the transport of military ships from the Gulf of Thailand where Washington believes China is building its first overseas base in the Indo-Pacific region \u2014 and also concerns about the canal\u2019s environmental impact, including that it will direct water away from the Mekong river.\n\u201cWe urge authorities to coordinate closely with the Mekong River Commission to provide additional project details and to participate fully in any appropriate environmental impact studies to help the MRC and member countries fully understand, assess, and prepare for any possible impacts of the project,\u201d Holzer said.\nVietnam also expressed environmental concerns and said that it \u201crequests Cambodian side to coordinate closely with Vietnam and other countries in sharing information and assessing the impact of this project\u201d on water resources and the environment, Doan Khac Viet, deputy spokesperson of Vietnam\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said during a press briefing on Thursday.\nChina\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThe project comes as Prime Minister Hun Manet has deepened already close ties with Beijing since taking the reins from his father less than a year ago. Cambodia\u2019s relationship with the US remains rocky, with considerable strain over a range of issues including human rights, press freedom and the suppression of political opposition.\nWashington has repeatedly expressed concern over what it sees as the growing influence of China\u2019s military in the country, including the Beijing-supported redevelopment of the Ream Naval Base, something US Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs Daniel Kritenbrink raised with officials during a visit earlier this year.\nMilitary experts say the canal \u201cwill create the necessary depth, enough for military ships to travel from the Gulf of Thailand, or from the Ream base, deep into the interior,\u201d Vietnam\u2019s state-controlled People\u2019s Public Security Political Academy published on its website last month, citing external research. \u201cThe Funan Techo Canal is not simply a socio-economic development project but also has great military value and has a strong impact on the defence and security situation of the entire region.\u201d\nHun Sen, who is now president of Cambodia\u2019s senate, on Tuesday meanwhile dismissed unspecified \u201cslanderous reports about the presence of Chinese troops at the Ream,\u201d from \u201cnon-friends\u201d who he said are now twisting the real use of the canal.\n\u201cWhy would Cambodia bring Chinese troops into its country, which violates the constitution? And why would China bring its troops to Cambodia, which is contrary to the principle of respect for Cambodia\u2019s independence?\u201d he wrote in a post on X. \u201cThis vital infrastructure facilitates agricultural activities by providing water for crop cultivation, is good for water management during the rainy season, and increases freshwater fish production, among other benefits.\u201d\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat type of accommodation do you usually prefer when traveling in Thailand?\nLuxury hotels (5-star)\nMid-range hotels (3-4 star)\nHostels and guesthouses\nPrivate rentals (Airbnb or villas)\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nUs\nThailand\nCambodia\nVietnam\nChina\nCanal\nMilitary\nDo you like the content of this article?\n6\n26\nCOMMENT\n(10)",

(Photo: Reuters)\nHONG KONG: China is positioning itself to become one of the top foreign investors in Nusantara, the planned new capital of Indonesia that is being built from scratch over the next 20 years in the middle of forests and palm tree farms.\nThe investment is expected to become the stand-out showpiece in a growing body of work building smart cities and other landmark urban zones in other countries, analysts said.\nThe projects in turn would help China connect with friendly nations to facilitate trade, they added, giving Chinese construction firms a chance to prove themselves abroad.\nADVERTISEMENT\n\"It's fair to say that China has the strongest squad of engineers and constructors, who have benefited from the country's building boom since the mid-2000s,\" said Xu Tianchen, a senior China-based economist with the Economist Intelligence Unit.\n\"China is also experienced in providing full life cycle solutions, from financing to construction and maintenance, which make life easier for host countries.\"\nRELATED\nbusiness\nChina's BYD opens EV factory in Thailand, first in Southeast Asia\nthailand\nThe 97km that frustrate China's mastery of the Mekong\nBeijing-based state-owned builder Citic Construction has expressed interest in developing 60 residential towers in Nusantara, which is set to replace flood-prone Jakarta as the national capital.\nThe move had been delayed due to the coronavirus pandemic, but government offices may be relocated this year as officials seek to reduce the burden on Jakarta.\n\"I'm not surprised that China will invest a lot in Indonesia, including [Nusantara], because the Indonesian minister of investment has said that doing business with China is easy and they are not fussy about asking for various requirements like other countries,\" said Nukila Evanty, a Jakarta-based member of the Asia Centre research institute's \u00adadvisory board.\nBuilding cities for other countries also naturally follows China's 45-year \"leap\" in its own urban development, as well as the goals of its Belt and Road Initiative, said Victor Gao, vice-president of the Centre for China and Globalisation in Beijing.\nBeijing's signature Belt and Road Initiative has spawned China-funded infrastructure projects in scores of countries, including ports, highways and power plants.\nConstruction of smart cities - a term that usually refers to technology-aided management of traffic and urban resources - advances China's goal of increasing \"connectivity\", especially in countries near its borders such as in Southeast Asia, Gao said.\nChinese-funded projects in Nusantara - which is located on the east coast of the island of Borneo - would follow work in Africa, the Middle East and elsewhere in Asia.\nIn Egypt, Chinese contractors built much of the New Administrative Capital government centre, Egyptian Hong Kong-based consul general Baher Sheweikhi previously told the South China Morning Post. The new capital includes one of the African nation's tallest skyscrapers.\nSeveral Chinese companies are also helping construct Egypt's New Alamein, a city designed to accommodate autonomous shared cars and public transport systems, Xu added.\nChina is also taking part in the construction of Neom in Saudi Arabia, which officials call a \"futuristic\" development. Chinese firms have worked on tunnels, solar power stations and water desalination projects, Xu said.\nIn 2019, China and Kenya signed a US$665 million deal to help build \"smart cities\" in the African nation, with Chinese telecommunications equipment giant Huawei Technologies nominated to carry out the work.\nAnd in 2020, Alibaba Cloud - Alibaba Group Holding's cloud computing unit - received clearance in 2020 to install hardware for Kuala Lumpur's smart city system that is designed to collect and integrate real-time data from traffic cameras. Alibaba is the owner of the\nSouth China Morning Post\n.\nChina already ranks as Indonesia's second-largest investor after Singapore following a steep climb over the past decade, with combined direct investment from mainland China and Hong Kong in 2023 of US$13.9 billion.\n\"Chinese construction companies are increasingly competitive worldwide, in terms of expertise,\" said Zha Daojiong, an international studies professor at Peking University.\nAnd while countries have their own property developers, Chinese firms may carry out higher-quality work, Gao added.\nThe output value of China's construction industry topped 31 trillion yuan (US$4.3 trillion) in 2022, according to\nPeople's Daily\n.\nThe projects in Nusantara are also significant for China because Indonesia is Southeast Asia's largest country, a member of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership trade pact and an original member of the Belt and Road Initiative, said Zhao Xijun, a finance professor at Renmin University in Beijing.\nAnd a US$7.3 billion, 142km high-speed railway built by a Chinese-invested consortium on the populous island of Java, which opened last year, should be seen as a \"model\" for what China can do, Zhao added.\n\"That's a very successful cooperation project in terms of investment in Indonesia,\" Zhao said.\nThe Nusantara Capital City Authority estimated that domestic firms have committed US$2.2 billion toward building the future capital versus a total cost of about US$30 billion - leaving plenty of space for foreign investors.\nBut Chinese investments in the development of foreign cities comes with risks of delays, overruns, financing and social stability, analysts added.\nOfficials in Beijing are watching Belt and Road Initiative partners for any \"country-specific risks\", linked to economic trends and social stability, Zhao said, although Indonesia is considered \"low risk\", he added.\nBut China would still stay on alert for \"significant delays and cost overruns\" on the Indonesian capital construction projects, Xu said.\nChinese contractors experienced delays and overruns on the Java high-speed railway, he added.\nHe said some Indonesian citizens and officials already resent China over past disputes over mining projects.\nBeijing's role in Nusantara would face particular scrutiny if the Indonesian government provides the public little information about Chinese investment, Evanty added, pointing to a perception that Chinese workers take jobs away from locals.\n\"A few people tend to be xenophobic towards workers from China, especially in disadvantaged areas where unemployment and poverty are high and where there is Chinese investment,\" she said.\n//////////\nTrucks are seen near a palm oil plantation at a village located near Indonesia's projected new capital, known as Nusantara National Capital, in Sepaku, East Kalimantan province, Indonesia, on March 8 2023.

(Photo: Bloomberg)\nWASHINGTON - An ambitious project to link the emerging industrial powers of South Asia with Europe and beyond is moving at two speeds, illustrating the difficulty of aligning aspirations for one of the world\u2019s longest trade routes during a period of geopolitical turmoil.\nAfter signing on to the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC) agreement at the Group of 20 meetings in New Delhi in September, governments in the United States, the European Union (EU) and several European nations are bogged down financially and preoccupied diplomatically by two wars.\nMeanwhile, India and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) \u2014 two additional parties to the IMEC pact whose geopolitical alliances differ from those in Brussels and Washington \u2014 have taken swift action on infrastructure projects. Those include locking in a swath of port, railway and digital work during India Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s visit to Abu Dhabi in mid-February. India is pushing on domestic projects like a western railway to help move its exports swiftly to the Middle East.\nADVERTISEMENT\nFrom the UAE's perspective, talks about the trade corridor are still ongoing and progressing, according to a person familiar with the matter, having not been derailed by the Israel-Hamas war. The Gulf nation will aim to build on its relationships with all involved countries and particularly India, the person said, taking advantage of both existing and new infrastructure.\nThe UAE's Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not respond to a request for comment.&nbsp;\nRELATED\nbusiness\nSET lacks catalysts until year-end\nbusiness\nIEAT unveils plan to attract Chinese investment to Thailand\nThe ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict effectively stalled broader IMEC conversations as of Oct 7, especially as the normalisation of Israel-Saudi relations was a key goal to the US-led deal.&nbsp;\nWith the US mired in domestic debate over whether and how to secure more funding for Ukraine\u2019s defence against Russia, European officials are siphoning every bit of available funds to the cause. That leaves both with little energy and resources to devote to pressing ahead with IMEC. European officials have privately affirmed that there are other priorities in the Middle East right now.\nThe White House's National Security Council declined to comment.\nThe two conflicts are huge hurdles for the US and European goal of re-affirming the Western-led global order and offering an alternative to China, which has long made inroads in courting Global South countries on infrastructure.\n\"The EU needs to turn the project into a success as part of its efforts to counterbalance China's BRI \u2014 but it is struggling to dedicate financing and diplomatic firepower to move it along decisively,\" said Rym Momtaz, a Paris-based researcher for the International Institute for Strategic Studies, referring to China's Belt &amp; Road Initiative (BRI).\nIndia, the UAE, and other Middle Eastern nations are moving ahead for the economic benefits of securing fresh trade routes \u2014 especially as conflict in the Middle East that\u2019s stalled the project also has made IMEC ever more critical to supply chain resiliency.\nModi's outreach\nModi met with UAE leader Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan last month in Abu Dhabi, where the war and conflict in the Red Sea featured heavily in discussions, according to India's Foreign Secretary Vinay Kwatra.&nbsp;\nIndia's Prime Minister Narendra Modi addresses his supporters in Ahmedabad, India, on Tuesday. (Photo: Reuters)\nIn the same week, AD Ports Group, the Abu Dhabi logistics company, announced an agreement with the Indian transportation firm RITES Ltd and the Gujarat Maritime Board. The three agreed to develop new ports, railways and other infrastructure, as well as explore joint opportunities related to IMEC, AD Ports said in a statement.\nIndia also has cut deals and moved to shore up domestic infrastructure in the name of fulfilling their part of the IMEC vision.&nbsp;\nDP World Ltd signed a 250-billion-rupee (US$3.02-billion) contract in January to upgrade port infrastructure in Gujarat, including deep-draft ports, a special economic zone, and a private freight station. An India Mart facility in the UAE that Indian officials say will be ready by year's end would allow 40,000 Indian firms to pre-position goods. And a 1,506-kilometre (936-mile) rail line connecting northern India to ports in western India, part of which is already operational, is expected to keep goods flowing from production hubs to ports.\nTo be sure, the IMEC project has not garnered support from all countries that it affects. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, for one, has said it cannot exist without his sign-off, which he has withheld.&nbsp;&nbsp;\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron also is seeking to host a first meeting to lay the groundwork of IMEC, his special envoy for the project, Gerard Mestrallet, told Bloomberg.\nBut that proposal has been privately questioned by other countries on the grounds that France did not have a primary role ahead of the IMEC announcement, according to officials from two countries that are party to the agreement and who declined to be identified discussing the topic publicly.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhich app or platform do you usually use to book accommodations?\nBooking.com\nAgoda\nAirbnb\nTrip.com\nTraveloka\nExpedia\nSkyscanner\nDirectly with the accommodation\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nTrade\nAsia\nEurope\nEu\nUnited states\nDo you like the content of this article?\n3\n5\nCOMMENT\n(1)",

In so doing, she sheds light on Indonesia\u2019s ambitious journey towards becoming the 4th largest economy in the world.\nWhat are the key drivers of Indonesia\u2019s economy moving forward and what role do you see the country playing in global and regional trade?\nWe believe Indonesia will play an increasingly important role in both trade within Southeast Asia and with the region\u2019s key trading partners. We are Southeast Asia\u2019s largest economy with a clear vision to become the 4th largest single economy in the world within 2045, driven by factors such as positive demographics, a growing middle class, a vibrant startup scene and abundant natural resources. This puts us on a path to deliver consistent future growth and to offer great potential in the digitalisation, renewable energy, healthcare, supply chain and manufacturing sectors. New growth areas, such as electric vehicle (EV) production provide fertile ground for investment. These are some of the factors that led Bangkok Bank to acquire PermataBank in 2020, which was the largest intra-ASEAN banking acquisition in history. We celebrate the fourth anniversary of our acquisition in the coming May.\nOur economy proved itself to be robust and resilient throughout the coronavirus pandemic, recovering faster than average compared to other countries. This helps create confidence in our position as a reliable, major producer of raw materials for other industries within the ASEAN region and beyond. Going forward, the development and economic integration of the greater Asian region, spanning from China and Japan, through ASEAN countries to Indonesia, will be a driving force for the economies of Southeast Asian nations. We are well placed to support development programmes such as the Belt and Road Initiative and the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity.\nRELATED\nthailand\nWarmest congratulations to INDONESIA on her Independence Day\nbusiness\nThai banks stay the course\nThe region\u2019s economic growth prospects remain relatively high, coupled with strong regional stability, making it attractive for investors. Moreover, with the trend of diversifying manufacturing value chains in addition to China, ASEAN countries are emerging as potential destinations for investors, offering relatively high growth, cost-effective production, and labour, and a consistently growing market.\nHow important is ASEAN to Indonesia\u2019s growth?\nASEAN plays a highly significant role in our economy, both as a trade partner and a source of foreign direct investment. ASEAN is Indonesia\u2019s second-largest trading partner after China, accounting for 21% of our total trade value in 2022. Trade between Indonesia and ASEAN is on an upward trend and reached US$111.4 billion in 2022.\nBy being part of ASEAN, Indonesia gains broader market access for our products, and similarly, ASEAN countries can market their products in Indonesia. With the increasingly integrated global manufacturing production chains, Indonesia and ASEAN countries can collaborate to enhance their roles in the global manufacturing production chain, which is already evident in the automotive industry.\nA key driver of our ability to support such developments is Bangkok Bank Group\u2019s Connecting ASEAN strategy, which focuses on building the partnerships and facilitating the trade and investment needed to deliver sustainable growth across the region. Bangkok Bank has been building its regional and international network since 1954 and this enables us to tap into unparalleled expertise, experience, and advice on how to help businesses invest and grow across the region.\nWe are working to help customers understand the importance of having a regionalisation strategy. Currently, most Indonesian companies are focused on our domestic market because it offers so much growth potential, a key factor in attracting investment from other ASEAN markets such as Thailand. However, we believe those local companies that develop a regionalisation strategy now will gain significant long-term advantages over those who decide to wait longer.\nConnecting ASEAN goes beyond trade and investment to facilitating regional financial connectivity, interoperability, and cross border payment. We have worked with Bangkok Bank to achieve good successes through the use of QR code cross-border payment as well as trade finance.\nWhat are you seeing in terms of trade and investment between Thailand and Indonesia?\nDirect investment and trade value from Thailand into Indonesia has been steadily increasing over the past 20 years. Foreign direct investment (FDI) from Thailand to Indonesia has grown from $16 million in 2003 to $186 million in 2023. Moreover, total trade value between Thailand and Indonesia also rose significantly, from $3.1 billion in 2003 to $19.2 billion in 2022.\nPermataBank, Indonesia\u2019s 8th largest bank by assets, can support companies wanting to invest or expand into Indonesia by providing a full range of corporate banking services. We can also support the investors\u2019 and their employees\u2019 deposit and wealth banking needs served through our digital platform and 216 domestic branches.\nWe are also concentrating on facilitating business matching to help PermataBank and Bangkok Bank customers find the right partner to expand their endeavours. At the same time, we are striving to provide cross-selling synergy to both banks\u2019 customers and accelerate cross-border trade through the support of ASEAN member governments.\nWe are also working with Bangkok Bank Group customers in Thailand. Recently PermataBank collaborated with The Mall Group in Thailand to deliver real value to PermataBank credit card customers who can access discounts and special prices when using their PermataBank cards at The Mall Group outlets in Thailand.\nHow are Indonesia\u2019s government, regulators and businesses doing in terms of adopting ESG and transitioning to net zero? What are the key challenges they are facing?\nIndonesia is taking sustainability very seriously. We have a diverse ecosystem, abundant natural resources, and a fast-growing population, so it is critical that we develop sustainably to safeguard the future for generations to come.\nPresident Jokowi\u2019s government committed to achieving net zero within 2060. To support this, the Financial Services Authority (OJK) developed the Sustainable Finance Roadmap 2021-2025 and published the Green Taxonomy in 2022. These initiatives help provide a regulatory ESG framework for finance which can help attract both domestic and foreign investment to help the country to achieve its sustainability objectives.\nThis relatively new focus on sustainability and sustainable finance has been received positively in Indonesia. More green financing products such as green bonds, sustainability bonds, sustainability-linked loans, social impact bonds, and SME loans, as well as sustainable investment funds, are being developed. There\u2019s also increasing focus on the social aspect of ESG in terms of expanding financial inclusion to unbanked and underbanked people.\nWhile Indonesia has started its sustainability journey, we know we will face challenges along the way. We are the world\u2019s fourth-largest emitter of greenhouse gases and Southeast Asia relies on fossil fuels for about 80% of the region\u2019s energy production. It is important that we help facilitate a just transition which balances the demand for an affordable, reliable supply of electricity to households with the pace of decarbonisation.\nInitiatives, such as Indonesia\u2019s Just Energy Transition Partnership, are already in place to mitigate such challenges. The partnership will mobilise $20 billion in public and private financing to decarbonise Indonesia\u2019s energy sector through decarbonisation of coal power plants, expanding renewable energy capacity and infrastructure, and developing a green ecosystem. While this is a good start, it falls well short of the investment that will be required.\nTransition requires funds and innovation, and this will also lead to new opportunities for investment and job creation in the sustainability space, such as green infrastructure, electric vehicles, environmentally friendly transportation, renewable energy, waste management, sustainable buildings, and sustainable tourism.\nAs part of Bangkok Bank Group, PermataBank is able to draw on the group\u2019s experience and expertise both in terms of providing transition finance as well as advising corporate customers on how they can seek new opportunities in the sustainability space, identify and manage ESG-related risks and adapt their business models to comply with increasingly stringent ESG regulations. Bangkok Bank is a leading financier of green/renewable energy and transition finance in ASEAN as well as the leading underwriter of green and ESG bonds in Thailand.\nWhat impact do you think the recent elections will have on Indonesia\u2019s economic strategy and direction?\n(This interview was conducted before the official result of the election was announced)\nThe official results will be released by 20 March, so we do not have confirmation of the winner yet. We are the world\u2019s third largest democracy with more than 200 million eligible voters and the elections for more than 20,000 seats across more than 17,000 islands were conducted in a free and fair way. Whoever is officially declared the winner, we expect key economic and sustainability policies and commitments to remain largely intact. While the different presidential candidates proposed different policies, in terms of the business and economic environment, we expect continuity in the approach to creating a transparent and welcoming investment environment. We are all committed to helping Indonesia grow in an equitable and sustainable manner.\nwww.permatabank.com\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nHow much do hotel reviews (e.g., TripAdvisor, Google Reviews) influence your accommodation choice?\nVery important, I always check reviews before booking\nSomewhat important, I check reviews if I\u2019m unsure\nNeutral, I don\u2019t pay much attention to reviews\nNot important at all, I don\u2019t check reviews\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nPermataBank\nDo you like the content of this article?\n3\n0",

It is among the major investment schemes the government is trying to promote among potential foreign investors.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThose who support the Land Bridge project said it would help improve the economy, but those against the project are concerned about its environmental impact and financial costs.\nRELATED\nproperty\nCPN allots B1bn to enlarge Phuket mall\nbusiness\nFinance Minister Pichai sees B3tn for stimulus funds\nSome people want the government to conduct a well-rounded survey on the project to lessen the environmental and livelihood impacts.\nPrime Minister Srettha Thavisin has said previously the government is trying to create a climate fitting for foreign investment as it plans roadshows overseas to draw more attention from foreign investors.\nThe Land Bridge is the country's largest investment project in 20 years after the construction of Suvarnabhumi airport, he said.\nThe 1-trillion-baht megaproject aims to develop a logistics network connecting Ranong along the Andaman Sea to Chumphon along the Gulf of Thailand.\nThe project comprises deep-water ports in both provinces, a motorway cutting across the land to connect the two provinces and a railway system.\nTouted benefits\nThe study suggested investment for the project should be carried out under a public private partnership (PPP) model, allowing the private sector to invest in the construction and management of the project for 50 years.\nAccording to the study, Thailand's geographical position makes the country an ideal site for the project as the country serves as a gateway for transport and trade in the region as well as links with other continents.\nThe Land Bridge project will become a new logistics and transport hub as well as a new route for shipping, serving as an alternative to the existing route for the shipment of goods from the Indian Ocean to the Pacific Ocean through the Strait of Malacca.\nIt will help cut travel time from nine days through the Strait of Malacca to five days, reducing costs, according to the study.\nThe project's net present value (NPV) is estimated at more than 257 billion baht and the project's payback period is 24 years, according to the study. The payback period is the length of time an investor needs to recover an investment or reach a breakeven point.\nThe project is expected to create 130,000 jobs in Ranong, 150,000 jobs in Chumphon and to increase GDP from an earlier estimate of 4% per year by the National Economic and Social Development Council, to 5.5%, according to the study.\nIt forms part of the development of the Southern Economic Corridor, which comprises parts of Chumphon, Ranong, Surat Thani and Nakhon Si Thammarat provinces, the study said.\nThe study also suggested that since the Land Bridge is such a massive investment project, a special law is need for its implementation, as in the case of the Eastern Economic Corridor (EEC) project, while an environmental impact assessment is also required.\nThe study noted the private sector still expresses concern about the impact of the project on communities as a result of land expropriation.\nThe private sector suggested the government should offer appropriate compensation to ease the plight of people affected by the project and also upskill local labourers to prepare for the Southern Economic Corridor and the Land Bridge project, as well as plans to protect the environment and natural resources.\n\"It is necessary for the government to provide locals with clear information and allow them a say in the project,'' the study suggested.\nTransport Minister Suriya Juangruangreangkit said the Land Bridge project is part of the Southern Economic Corridor which will boost logistics, connectivity and trade with member countries of the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation -- Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Myanmar, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Thailand.\n\"Several countries are keeping an eye on how Thailand will carry out the Land Bridge project while some countries have expressd interest in investing,\" he said.\n\"The project will benefit from Thailand's geopolitical advantage as the country is located between the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean, with sea routes on both sides. Apart from benefits in terms of transport, investments in related industries will take place in local areas,\" Mr Suriya said.\nSuriya: Set to boost logistics and trade\nMFP's objections\nHowever, Deputy Move Forward Party leader and list MP Sirikanya Tansakun has raised objections to the project.\nShe was among four MFP MPs who quit the House committee studying the megaproject. They said they do not want to rubber-stamp a project they disagree with.\nShe said she quit because it accepted the content of a report prepared by the Office of Transport and Traffic Policy and Planning (OTP) without thorough scrutiny.\nMs Sirikanya said they had repeatedly asked the OTP to clarify the project's cost-effectiveness, the type of ships that would use the services provided by the project, and the volume of goods expected to go through ports.\nHowever, the OTP did not give a reply, she said, adding the study by the House committee was based on the OTP's report. She insisted the MFP agrees with the government's southern economic development plan, but officials must quell all doubts before concluding whether investing in the project is worth it or not.\n\"I am not attempting to obstruct development in the South. But I am ready to support the project if the report from the OTP and the House committee's study is revised or a new study is conducted to ensure cost-effectiveness,\" she said.\nSirikanya: Questions cost-effectiveness\nThirarat Samretwanich, a Pheu Thai MP for Bangkok and spokeswoman for the special House committee studying the project, said the study has been sent back to the cabinet after the House of Representatives endorsed it.\nThe cabinet will now act on the recommendations provided in the study and find ways to address any concerns raised before resubmitting it to parliament, she said.\nResponding to criticism on the project's cost-effectiveness, Ms Thirarat said the Land Bridge project requires an investment of about 1 trillion baht, and it will come entirely from the private sector. She said it is up to potential investors to consider whether the project is worth investing in.\n\"If they find that using the&nbsp;shipping route will save their costs, they will decide to invest. They can decide on the cost-effectiveness themselves,\" she said, adding that bidding for the project is expected next year.\nThirarat: Study sent back to cabinet\nWeighing impacts\nAssoc Prof Somjai Phagaphasvivat, an independent political and economic analyst, told the Bangkok Post the Pheu Thai-led government is determined to push for the project alongside the ruling party's digital wallet scheme.\nHowever, he said the Land Bridge megaproject requires a substantial sum of money, will take a long time to materialise and it must be undertaken in phases.\n\"The project may take at least 10 years before it can materialise as it involves attracting investors, analysing the budget, infrastructure and utilities,\" he said. \"The project will also connect with the Greater Mekong Subregion, Europe, and China's Belt and Road Initiative,\" Assoc Prof Somjai said.\nHowever, the project's potential impact on fiscal stability, society and the environment must be weighed before implementation, he said. He said the government must also convince investors that the project will help cut shipping time and costs. How the government handles the land expropriation issue and rivalry with Singapore's port will also come into play.\n\"This project is tough because it requires a huge sum of money. But the public debt-to-GDP ratio is about 61% now and investment expenditure accounts for only 20% of the annual expenditure budget.\nEconomic growth remains sluggish while the country's competitiveness is low,\" he said.\n\"It depends on the government's ability to convince investors,\" he said, adding the Land Bridge project could become a potential geopolitical flashpoint as competing powers vie for influence in the region.\nSomjai: Requires a huge sum of money\nJiraroth Sukolrat, deputy director of the OTP, said work on the required environmental impact assessment (EIA), construction design and business development model are expected to be completed in September. They will then be presented for cabinet approval in July or August of next year.\nBidding will be open by the middle of 2025 and the first phase of construction will begin in September of 2025 and could be complete in September 2030, he said, adding that as investment will come entirely from the private sector, the government will only deal with land expropriation.\nJiraroth: EIA to be done by September\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat is your budget range for purchasing a condominium?\nEkkamai-Thong Lor\nSathorn-Silom\nChidlom-Siam\nBang Na\nChinatown\nAri\nRiverside\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nLand bridge\nSouth\nProject\nBaht\nTrillion\nDo you like the content of this article?\n7\n163\nCOMMENT\n(49)",

While the country has made significant progress in socio-economic development in recent years, food insecurity is still an ongoing and serious issue amid global and regional food supply and price fluctuations. According to a recent United Nations report, about 2.5 million Cambodians -- around 15% of the population -- experience severe food insecurity.\nRELATED\nworld\nUS warship makes rare visit to&nbsp;Cambodia&nbsp;base at centre of feud\nthailand\nSEA-TEP Model: Shaping the Future of Teacher Education\nWith a population of around 16.5 million people, nearly 80% of which live in rural areas. Agriculture plays a key role in the country's economy. Cambodia's population relies heavily on agriculture and fisheries, which employs up to 49% of the country's labour force and accounts for 22% of the country's gross domestic product (GDP). Sixty-five percent of Cambodians rely on agriculture, fisheries, and forestry for their livelihoods.\nAgriculture remains largely dominated by rice (70%), the country's most important export commodity and major crop. This is followed by subsidiary and industrial crops (such as sugar cane) (20%), rubber plantations (7%), and permanent crops (such as cashew) (4%), rendering the country reliant on rice.\nHowever, its leading markets are varied, demonstrating the country's interest and willingness to pursue a diversification strategy. In 2023, Cambodia exported nearly 8.45 million tonnes of agricultural products (US$4.3 billion, or about 155.2 billion baht) to about 75 countries and regions, with China, Vietnam, and Thailand among the main markets.\nAlthough agriculture could be a strong driver of socio-economic growth and food security in Cambodia, a number of concerns must first be addressed.\nThe rise of climate-related disasters (such as severe droughts) is notably severe too. Cambodia also faces high disaster risks from flood and drought due in part to high levels of exposure and vulnerability and a low adaptive capacity. Cambodia's 4.5 million hectares of cultivated land is mainly rainfed, making it reliant on the weather and precipitation. Thus, the agriculture sector is particularly vulnerable to climate-related disasters. Increased temperatures, increasingly unpredictable weather, and shifting precipitation patterns alongside extensive damming for hydropower throughout the Mekong Basin, could impact food security and human health through reduced freshwater availability, declines in agricultural and fishery production, and increases in water-borne diseases.\nRural families, especially small-scale farmers -- who make up 75 percent of the country's 6.8 million farmers, are among the most vulnerable, given their dependence on agriculture for their livelihood.\nTo address these interlinked issues, the government and policymakers may encourage crop diversification to reduce reliance on rice, such as the cultivation of more less water-consuming resilient and climate-resistant crop varieties alongside the irrigation of land.\nEarly warning systems for weather forecasting and climate monitoring could also be implemented to help farmers take preventive measures or adjust their farming practices accordingly. Australia, which has significant experience in areas such as agricultural technologies, disaster risk management and monitoring, and climate change adaptation, can help.\nWater resources must be managed better, too. As the country experiences seasonal water scarcity and has limited potential for water harvesting and storage facilities to improve water availability due to relatively flat topography, Cambodia could look to countries like Australia where improved water use efficiency in the agricultural sector (such as through drip irrigation systems) has helped reduce water stress concerns. In recent decades, water-use productivity by Australian cotton growers has improved by 40% due to yield increases and more efficient water-management systems.\nIn addition to improving the country's production and post-harvest infrastructure, as well as transport and logistic infrastructure to strengthen agri-food value chains, access to finance and knowledge should also be improved alongside increased access to agricultural inputs and machinery for increasing labour productivity.\nCambodia's lack of further processing technology for the production of higher value-added products is another concern. Due to the limited processing capacity of Cambodian agricultural products, the majority of the country's exported goods are primary products. In response, policymakers could improve the processing capacity of Cambodian agricultural products through infrastructure, financing, and research and development (R&amp;D) for processing and product development.\nForeign direct investment (FDI) opportunities in Cambodia's agricultural sector should not be ignored either. The commercialisation and development of processing industries, for instance, could offer such opportunities. A meeting between the chairman of Asian agribusiness Wilmar International and the Cambodian prime minister earlier this year shows that there is interest in doing so.\nA growing number of countries in the region are also interested in greater agricultural and food cooperation with Cambodia. Aside from Australia, one of the country's long-standing strategic partners and major agricultural development partners, inter-regional investment remains possible. In September last year, Memorandums of Understanding on agricultural cooperation and small business development were signed by Southeast Asian states as part of broader efforts to push the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) towards stronger economic integration.\nOther countries are interested, too. For instance, Indonesia, Cambodia's sixth-largest trading partner, is eyeing potential investments in Cambodia's rice bowl. In November 2023, the first shipment of Cambodian rice reached Indonesia.\nThailand, also Cambodia's second-largest trade partner in ASEAN, aims to reach US$15 billion in bilateral trade, including agricultural trade, by 2025.\nElsewhere, import-reliant Japan remains interested in Cambodian agricultural exports, while South Korea has announced it will continue to implement joint agricultural projects with Cambodia.\nCambodia's biggest trading partner, China, is interested in agricultural investment and food security cooperation with Cambodia, a Belt and Road Initiative country. Outside of participating in the new Asean-China food security agreement, the two countries seek stronger bilateral agricultural cooperation, as recent agreements to establish a \"Fish and Rice Corridor\" and a Sino-Cambodian \"Industrial Development Corridor\" demonstrate.\nOutside of Asia, both France and Israel have expressed interest in agricultural cooperation.\nCambodia's greater emphasis on local agricultural production and grand ambition of becoming one of the world's biggest agricultural producers face numerous domestic challenges.\nWhile it is clear that the government and policymakers will face a tough battle in addressing these concerns, opportunities for international, regional, inter-regional, and bilateral agricultural and food security cooperation with the country remain.\nGenevieve Donnellon-May is a research associate at the Asia Society Policy Institute and the Asia Society Australia.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat is your budget range for purchasing a house in Thailand?\nUnder 3 million THB\n3 million - 5 million THB\n5 million - 8 million THB\n8 million - 12 million THB\nOver 12 million THB\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nCambodia\nAgriculture\nDo you like the content of this article?\n65\n5\nCOMMENT\n(4)",

(Photo: Government House)\nPrime Minister Srettha Thavisin expressed hopes China will soon send another giant panda to Thailand, following the death of crowd favourite Lin Hui, as the two countries agreed to accelerate work on the long-delayed railway link through Laos.\nMr Srettha said on Monday that&nbsp; Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi supported his request to send a replacement panda to Thailand.\nThe prime minister said the giant pandas were symbolic of the warm bilateral ties between the two countries, which went back almost 50 years.\nADVERTISEMENT\n\"Thailand does not have a panda. But the absence of pandas does not truly mirror our close diplomatic relations with China over the past 50 years,\" he said after meeting with the Chinese minister at Government House in Bangkok.\nChiang Mai Zoo previously hosted two giant pandas, which became immediate stars after their arrival in 2003 as goodwill ambassadors. Xuang Xuang died in 2019 and his partner, Lin Hui, died last year.\nRELATED\nbusiness\nTime to invest is now, says PM\nopinion\nHope for land protesters\nMr Wang's visit was due to end on Monday. It was highlighted by the signing of a\nmutual visa-waiver agreement\n, which allows&nbsp;Thai and Chinese passport holders visa-free entry for 30 days, effective from March 1.\nThe Chinese minister said China and Thailand must accelerate the construction of a planned high-speed railway linking the countries, pushing an ambitious Southeast Asian network.\nMr Wang did not spell out a time-frame, but the government currently expects the 873-km section in Thailand to be up and running in 2028.\nUnder the Belt and Road initiative, a global trade and infrastructure plan championed by Chinese President Xi Jinping, Beijing has pushed for a high-speed railway network that links the southwestern Chinese city of Kunming to as far south as Singapore.\nThe plan involves three routes originating in Kunming passing through Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam then joining in Bangkok. Construction of the section in Thailand - seen by some as a \"fiscal trap\" - has been delayed in recent years for reasons ranging from cost-sharing to Covid-19.\nThailand and China must promote the early implementation of the China-Laos-Thailand connectivity concept, the Chinese Foreign Ministry cited Mr Wang as telling the prime minister.\nAccording to Thailand, construction of the first phase from Bangkok to Nakhon Ratchasima is over 15% complete, and should be operational by 2027. The second leg should be ready by 2028.\nThe Thailand section was delayed in 2016 when Bangkok rejected Chinese financing due to what it said were high interest rates.\nIt later agreed to shoulder the entire construction cost of 179 billion baht for the 252-km first phase, with China responsible for installing systems, design, and procurement of trains.\nThe second phase is to connect Nakhon Ratchasima to Nong Khai.\nThe outlook for the section connecting Bangkok with Malaysia and Singapore remains unclear after Kuala Lumpur halted the plan previously.\nThe Chinese minister sent the same message on Sunday, saying after meeting with Foreign Minister Parnpree Bahiddha-Nukara that the two countries should make progress on the rail project, which is under the Belt and Road Initiative, according to Xinhua.\nThailand and Laos agreed to\nextend railroad services\n&nbsp;from Thanaleng, the Lao border town opposite Nong Khai, to Khamsavath, a new station in southern Vientiane.\nThen-prime minister Prayut Chan-o-cha and the Chinese presient agreed last year to celebrate the&nbsp;golden jubilee of diplomatic ties with numerous activities next year.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat type of condominium are you most interested in?\nStudio\n1-bedroom\n2-bedroom\n3-bedroom\nPenthouse\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nDo you like the content of this article?\n7\n41\nCOMMENT\n(19)",

        "content": "Business\nGeneral\nLessons for Land Bridge advocates\nPUBLISHED : 29 Jan 2024 at 08:01\nNEWSPAPER SECTION:\nBusiness\nWRITER:\nPhusadee Arunmas, Wichit Chantanusornsiri, Lamonphet Apisitniran and Nareerat Wiriyapong\n&nbsp; Small\n&nbsp; Medium\n&nbsp; Large\n11\n48\nAn artist's interpretation of a deep-sea port in the Land Bridge project.\nDuring the mobile cabinet meeting in Ranong last week, the Land Bridge project once again became a disputed topic as locals in the proposed area met Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin and voiced concerns over the possible impact on their way of life and environmental damage.\nWith stagnant GDP growth projected for this year, economists suggest Thailand needs large-scale foreign investment to leap forward, and the government sees the Land Bridge as the ultimate answer as it aims to secure funding from the private sector in the form of a public-private partnership (PPP).\nBuilding a logistics shortcut via a megaproject, comprising infrastructure such as deep-sea ports, railways or a new economic zone is not a new proposal for Southeast Asia.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe suspended Dawei economic zone in Myanmar aimed to create a new logistics route connecting inland freight within Southeast Asia to a port in Dawei that could bypass the Malacca Strait.\nHowever, the project was reliant on private investment and the contractor in Thailand faced financial problems, with this uncertainty influencing Japanese funding.\nRELATED\nbusiness\nFinance Ministry pegs growth goal at 3.5%\nthailand\nPart of eastern Thai island of Koh Kham for sale at B1.8bn\nIf the Thai government insists on pursuing the Land Bridge project, lessons from Dawei episode should be considered to understand the challenges it faces.\nRISKS ABOUND\nChaichan Chareonsuk, chairman of the Thai National Shippers' Council, said the Land Bridge project is likely similar to the Dawei project in that it is supply-driven.\nHe said both projects carry the same risk: constant changes in the global supply chain over the project's duration, encompassing economic, political, social, legal, environmental, technological and innovative aspects.\n\"From a logistics perspective, the future of maritime transport remains uncertain. Many shipping routes may change, possibly switching to rely on the Belt and Road Initiative that utilises rail transport. In addition, the use of fuel for transport may decrease, shifting towards alternative energy sources such as electric vehicles,\" said Mr Chaichan.\n\"In terms of export markets, again it is unpredictable as Thailand's main markets may change. In the future, our key market may not be China. Everything is subject to rapid and unpredictable changes, and no one knows anything for certain.\"\nHe said if the government reduces the project size by considering global demand and develops a comprehensive development direction for the Southern Economic Corridor before building infrastructure, it would significantly reduce the investment required, increasing the chances of success for the project.\n\"Long-term investment stimulation is essential, but it must be in projects that align with the country's needs and direction. The government needs to identify the types of industries the country wants to support and potential buyers, as well as carefully evaluate the project's viability and worthiness,\" Mr Chaichan said.\n\"It is crucial that the business sector have confidence in the project's ability to generate profits or reduce its operational costs. Projects should also benefit surrounding communities, hiring and improving the skills of the local workforce to create long-term employment opportunities.\"\nMost importantly, he said the project should be developed sustainably, promoting environmentally friendly industries, supporting health tourism, and adding value to agricultural products in the project areas.\nALTERNATIVE ROUTE\nThe Land Bridge project is considered the government's largest scheme to drive the country's economy.\nAn economic development strategist who requested anonymity said dating back to the Ayutthaya period, the old capital city was equidistant between India and China, becoming a regional trade centre and an important connecting point between the two.\nGoods coming from Persia or India were routed via Dawei, then transported through Ranong and Ayutthaya.\nIn the colonial era, Myanmar and Singapore were colonised by the British, reshaping  regional trade routes through the Malacca  Strait, which has been an important maritime trade route between India and China  since then.\nThe Land Bridge project proposes to connect the Andaman Sea to the Gulf of Thailand via Ranong and Chumphon provinces as a transit hub.\nThe project involves building two deep-sea ports and 90 kilometres of road and rail lines to facilitate cargo transport between Chumphon on the eastern coast along the Gulf of Thailand to Ranong on the western coast along the Andaman Sea.\nThe project would become a new logistics and transport hub, as well as a new route for shipping, serving  as an alternative to the existing route between the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean.\nThe main selling point of the scheme is it would cut travel time from nine days to five days, thus reducing shipping expenses.\nThe initial concept involves building a transport route for goods from the Eastern Economic Corridor (EEC) at Laem Chabang port to the Andaman Coast for around 8 million tonnes annually.\nThe project would also serve as a development model for the Southern Economic Corridor.\nEconomists predict China would benefit the most from this project.\nThe bulk of freight traffic from China to Europe goes through the congested Malacca Strait between Malaysia, Indonesia and Singapore.\nSome strategists have proposed a second alternative of a cargo rail line that connects from Asia all the way to Europe.\nThe investment estimate for the project is 1 trillion baht, expected via a PPP where the private sector is the investor for the entire project.\nThis colossal undertaking would be executed in four phases, with the first estimated at 610 billion baht, the second 165 billion, the third 229 billion and the fourth 85.1 billion.\nRAISING COMPETITIVENESS\nSomjai Phagaphasvivat, an independent political and economic analyst, said in terms of economic rationality, the proposed 1-trillion-baht land bridge project is considered economically feasible and would help improve the country's competitiveness.\nMr Somjai said the project would allow other countries to use Thailand as a transport centre.\nThailand has lost competitiveness over the past two decades as the country's GDP expanded by only 2.6% on average, compared with 4.3% for Southeast Asia, he said.\nThe government needs to secure concrete investment to prevent a spike in public debt, said Mr Somjai.\nIncreasing income for the country through promoting tourism and soft power, stimulating exports, or attracting foreign direct investment will help strengthen the government's fiscal stability, he said.\nHowever, the project's potential impact on fiscal stability, society and the environment must be weighed before implementation, said Mr Somjai.\nThe public debt-to-GDP ratio is 62% now and investment expenditure accounts for only 20% of the annual expenditure budget.\nIf the project is unsuccessful, it will have an impact on the government's fiscal burden, he said.\nThere are also several uncontrollable external factors to consider that could affect the economy, such another potential pandemic or a war on the scale of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, said Mr Somjai.\nIn addition, he said the Land Bridge project has the potential to become a geopolitical flashpoint as competing powers vie for influence in the region, though Mr Srettha appears keen to sidestep such tensions by welcoming all investors.\nPrime Minister Srettha Thavisin at Laem Son National Park in tambon Muang Kluang of Ranong's Kapoe district on January 22, 2024 to inspect a construction site for the Land Bridge megaproject.\nFACTORS FOR SUCCESS\nKevalin Wangpichayasuk, deputy managing director of Kasikorn Research Center, said the proposed Land  Bridge is similar to the defunct Dawei project in that they are both massive in terms of investment and the host governments are trying to entice foreign financing.\nShe said the Dawei project failed for two reasons: political changes in Myanmar and the developer, which was a Thai company, had financial problems that hampered project development.\n\"I think the Thai government has greater capability than Myanmar to disburse budget and mobilise funding to support this project,\" Ms Kevalin told the Bangkok Post.\n\"It depends on finding the right investors and how much potential they see in this project.\"\nGiven the estimated cost of 1 trillion baht, the government should evaluate recent changes in geopolitics to ensure there is sufficient demand for shipments through this region to justify the Land Bridge, she said.\nConflicts between the US and China as well as Russia and Europe are leading to changes in global supply chain, said Ms Kevalin.\nGlobal companies and foreign investors have started to shift their investments to destinations such as India, Mexico and eastern Europe.\n\"As a result, there might be less demand for goods shipment via the regions the Land Bridge aims to serve,\" she said.\n\"With this level of investment, we need to ensure the project is worthwhile.\"\nIn addition, Ms Kevalin said the opinions of residents in the project area should be considered, comprising the provinces of Ranong, Chumphon, Surat Thani and Nakhon Si Thammarat.\nLocals should be consulted while drafting this project, and products and services from the region should be promoted, she said.\nThe Land Bridge should start as a special economic zone, similar to the Eastern Seaboard project before it expanded to the EEC, said Ms Kevalin.\nSingapore and Malaysia both have ports and similar projects under development, she said.\n\"We should not view the neighbouring projects as competitors, but rather as complements, benefiting the Southeast Asian region,\" said Ms Kevalin.\nNEW FACE OF THE SOUTH\nIf the government manages to develop the Land Bridge scheme, parts of the southern region will be moulded similarly to the Eastern Seaboard, becoming a new economic engine for the country, said Kriengkrai Thiennukul, chairman of the Federation of Thai Industries (FTI).\nHe said he believes the Land Bridge will play an important role in boosting foreign direct investment in the long term.\nInvestors from the Middle East and China are rumoured to be interested in the project, according to media reports, which can lead to the development of many industries such as oil refining and petrochemical manufacturing, said Mr Kriengkrai.\nMr Srettha said earlier Dubai Ports World, a multinational logistics company, expressed interest in investing in the megaproject.\n\"The Land Bridge will pave the way for the South to develop like the Eastern Seaboard,\" said Mr Kriengkrai.\nThe Eastern Seaboard scheme, which covers parts of Chon Buri, Rayong and Chachoengsao provinces, started in 1982 when the government wanted to develop deep-sea ports, industrial estates and facilities to support gas discovery in the Gulf of Thailand.\nWith the birth of new industries based on high technology, authorities added infrastructure to the seaboard and developed it into the EEC, which is expected to become the country's high-tech industrial hub.\nThe Land Bridge is expected to serve as a gateway linking goods shipping from Laem Chabang port, located in Chon Buri, with countries in the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation, as well as other nations.\n\"The Land Bridge is similar to the EEC, but the former is a long-term investment project with higher investment value than the latter,\" said Mr Kriengkrai.\n\"This does not mean the government has to make the whole investment by itself. It needs to partner with groups of investors.\"\nHe said he is confident the Land Bridge project has the potential to draw foreign investment.\nThe Land Bridge project is intended to connect the Andaman Sea and the Gulf of Thailand via Ranong and Chumphon provinces as a transit hub.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat factor most influences your decision to choose a hotel or resort?\nPrice and discounts\nHotel reviews and ratings\nProximity to attractions\nHotel loyalty programs (e.g., points, rewards)\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nLand bridge\nSouth\nProject\nBaht\nTrillion\nRisks\nDo you like the content of this article?\n7\n123\nCOMMENT\n(48)",

(Photo: Reuters)\nCHANCAY, Peru - In September, a group of Brazilian farmers and officials arrived in the Peruvian fishing town of Chancay. The draw: a new Chinese mega-port rising on the Pacific coast, promising to turbocharge South America\u2019s trade ties with China.\nThe $3.5-billion deepwater port, set to start operations late this year, will provide China with a direct gateway to the resource-rich region. Over the last 10 years, Beijing has unseated the United States as the largest trade partner for South America, devouring its soybeans, corn and copper.\nThe port, majority-owned by Chinese state-owned firm Cosco Shipping, will be the first controlled by China in South America. It will able to accommodate the largest cargo ships, which can head directly to Asia, cutting the journey time by two weeks for some exporters.\nADVERTISEMENT\nBeijing and Lima hope Chancay will become a regional hub, both for copper exports from the Andean nation as well as soy from western Brazil, which currently travels through the Panama Canal or skirts the Atlantic before steaming to China.\n\u201cThe Chancay mega-port aims to turn Peru into a strategic commercial and port hub between South America and Asia,\u201d Peru Trade Minister Juan Mathews Salazar told Reuters.\nRELATED\nworld\nLaos-China railway boosts trade and tourism, but also Beijing's clout\nlife\nA cultural gem in Macau\nPart of China\u2019s decade-old Belt and Road drive, the port embodies the challenge facing the United States and Europe as they look to counter Beijing\u2019s rising influence in Latin America. China\u2019s trade muscle has helped it win allies and gain leverage in political forums, finance and technology.\nFull construction started in 2018 at Chancay, some 80 kilometres north of Lima. Workers are now laying thousands of piles and breakwaters; work signs are written in white-on-red Chinese characters.\nThe first phase of Chancay is set be completed in November 2024. President Xi Jinping, expected in Peru for an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) summit that month, could inaugurate the port, a diplomatic source in Lima said.\nChina\u2019s embassy in Lima did not respond to Reuters queries.\n\u201cIt\u2019s part of China\u2019s new Silk Road,\u201d said Mario de las Casas, corporate affairs manager for Cosco Shipping, which holds a 60% stake in the port. The remainder is controlled by local miner Volcan, in which Glencore owns a stake.\nJose Adriano da Silva, a farming entrepreneur from Brazil\u2019s western Acre state who visited the port, said the project would accelerate regional development. He said talks between Peruvian and Brazilian officials were under way to resolve overland transport challenges.\nPeru\u2019s government is planning an exclusive economic zone near the port and Cosco wants to build an industrial hub near Chancay to process raw materials that could include grains and meat from Brazil before shipping them to Asia.\nBrazil\u2019s ambassador in Peru, Clemente Baena Soares, said there were plans for meetings between officials early this year to seek to resolve logistical, sanitary and bureaucratic hurdles at the border so Brazilian trucks can more easily reach the port.\n\u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity for grain and meat production \u2014 especially from Rondonia, Acre, Mato Grosso and Amazonas \u2014 to go to Asia through the port of Chancay,\u201d said Soares, who also visited Chancay in September, naming four states in western Brazil.\n\u201c(Brazilian businesses) are delighted with the possibility of not using the Panama Canal to take their goods to Asia.\u201d\nHe added there would need to be investment in an existing road known as the Interoceanic Highway \u2014 which runs from further south in Peru across the Andes to Brazil \u2014 to improve transport routes. A long-discussed rail link remained in the study phase, he said. (Story continues below)\nA truck is seen outside a tunnel at the construction site of the Chinese-funded port in Chancay, Peru. (Photo: Reuters)\nStark transformation\nChina overtook the United States as the top trade partner to South and Central America under former president Donald Trump, despite his administration warning the region about the dangers of getting too close to Beijing. Under President Joe Biden the gap has widened despite attempts to reverse it.\nUS officials are now taking a different tack, arguing that the United States offers the region other things beyond trade, including investment in high-tech industries.\n\u201cI think using the metric of trade to evaluate the influence of China is not an accurate way,\u201d Juan Gonzalez, a White House adviser and the National Security Council\u2019s Western Hemisphere senior director, told Reuters in Buenos Aires.\n\u201cWe\u2019re confident in our ability to compete with China,\u201d he added, urging regional governments to ensure there were no \u201cpolitical strings attached\u201d to trade with Beijing.\nBeijing says its trade and investment in Latin America is a win-win for both sides. Some 150 countries have signed on to the Belt and Road with China, including 22 in Latin America.\nThe change over 10 years is stark.\nA decade ago, Peru, the world\u2019s second-largest copper producer, traded slightly more with the United States than China. Now, China has a more than $10-billion lead in bilateral trade, the latest annual data show.\nThat trend is playing out around the region.\nReuters interviewed two dozen officials, business leaders and trade experts, along with an analysis of ten years of trade data, revealing how China\u2019s infrastructure spending is cementing its role as the key trade and investment partner for South America, defying an economic slowdown at home and US warnings about \u201cdebt trap diplomacy\u201d.\nPart of the shift is pragmatic. Fast-growing China needs the copper and lithium from South America\u2019s Andes, along with the corn and soy from the plains of Argentina and Brazil.\nBut its widening trade lead \u2014 some $100 billion around South America in the most recent annual data \u2014 brings extra clout.\nBeijing has in the last year upgraded ties with Uruguay and Colombia to \u201cstrategic partnerships\u201d \u2014 the latter a US ally.\nArgentina\u2019s President Javier Milei, once highly critical of China, has softened his stance since taking office last month, reflecting Beijing\u2019s importance to the crisis-hit economy.\nIt is the top buyer of Argentina\u2019s soy and beef and has an $18 billion currency swap line with the country \u2014 which Argentina\u2019s cash-strapped government has tapped to pay its debt, including with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).\n\u201cThe last thing our dear Argentine friends need in these challenging times is to lose the support of an important partner like China,\u201d the Chinese ambassador in Colombia wrote on social media platform X following Milei\u2019s inauguration. (Story continues below)\nA woman stands next to an information board at the construction site of the port in Chancay, Peru. (Photo: Reuters)\n\u2018Point of leverage\u2019\nPeru\u2019s trade with China doubled in the last decade to $33 billion in 2022, driven by rising copper exports, even as its commerce flatlined with the United States. China has invested some $24 billion in Peruvian mines, the power grid, transport and hydro-electric power generation over the same period.\nExports to China grew 9.3% in the first eleven months of last year, government data show, faster than the 5.3% growth of exports to the United States. Peru has a $9.4 billion trade surplus with China and a $1.3 billion deficit the United States.\nPeru\u2019s President Dina Boluarte met China\u2019s Xi in November at the Apec forum in San Francisco. They discussed the Chancay port, which Boluarte said was a \u201csignificant boost to free trade and new Chinese investments.\u201d\nThat came after an awkward on-the-move parlay in Washington with Biden, which was not given full bilateral meeting status.\n\u201cChina is taking advantage of our absence and that\u2019s a real problem,\u201d said Eric Farnsworth, a former White House adviser and State Department official, who is now a Latin America expert at the Council of the Americas and Americas Society.\nHe said the port bolstered China\u2019s powerful position in Peru and created a \u201cpoint of leverage\u201d in the region.\nTwo regional diplomats said it also reflected a more muscular and ambitious China, often backed by deep pockets: a far cry from a wave of Chinese immigration to Peru two centuries ago when migrants came as cotton workers or to set up \u2018chifas\u2019 \u2014 Chinese food outlets.\n\u201cNow business executives or bankers come, with big projects tucked under their belts,\u201d said Juan Carlos Capu\u00f1ay, Peru\u2019s former ambassador to China.\n\u2018New battleground for minerals\u2019\nChina hasn\u2019t had things all its own way. Its Belt and Road has faced pushback in Asia and Europe \u2014 Italy recently pulled out of the initiative \u2014 while bad debts owed to China have ballooned. In Latin America, projects from Argentina to Venezuela have faced hold-ups.\nDiplomats and trade experts also cautioned that the Chancay port would only be successful if regional infrastructure including roads and railways improved to enable goods to get there, including grains from Brazil.\nCurrently, the Interocean Highway \u2014 a little-used road corridor of some 2,600km in five sections, built more than a decade ago \u2014 links the Pacific Coast in the south of Peru to Brazil\u2019s state of Acre.\n\u201cThe issue today is a lack of regional connections, which is very complex for the success of the project,\u201d said Fernando Reyes Matta, former Chilean ambassador to China.\nNonetheless, several of the people said China\u2019s rise in South America was solidifying despite these headwinds, with the region desperate for financing and foreign currency.\nA senior European diplomat based in South America said the big gap in infrastructure funding in the region made it hard for the United States to \u201cstrong arm\u201d local governments to turn down Chinese money.\nMeanwhile, global interest had grown in South America\u2019s resources such as lithium, copper and grains.\n\u201cLatin America has become a new battle ground for those minerals between the United States, Europe and China,\u201d he said.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nHow much do hotel reviews (e.g., TripAdvisor, Google Reviews) influence your accommodation choice?\nVery important, I always check reviews before booking\nSomewhat important, I check reviews if I\u2019m unsure\nNeutral, I don\u2019t pay much attention to reviews\nNot important at all, I don\u2019t check reviews\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nBelt and Road\nPeru\nChina trade\nDo you like the content of this article?\nCOMMENT\n(11)",

The region is connected to Vietnam by land, sea and air, and it is served by over 30 international cargo and passenger services which depart from its three international airports and three deep-sea ports.\nLocal authorities are hoping these facilities will attract more businesses and tourists from Southeast Asia to visit the region, and vice versa, according to Dong Changting, the deputy director of External Publicity and Exchange Department of Guangxi Zhuang Automomous Region.\nADVERTISEMENT\nGuangxi is also known for having one of the highest numbers of education institutions which provide Thai language courses to Chinese students.\nRELATED\nbusiness\nL'Or\u00e9al outlines people-driven workplace transformation\nopinion\nTowards strategic Thai-French ties\nA growing number of Chinese students are interested in taking up Thai lessons in Guangxi prior to leaving for Thailand. Similarly, a source said, an increasing number of Thais are also coming to Guangxi to learn Chinese.\nThe Chinese government is keen to facilitate language exchanges as it expands its reach in the region through its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), the source said, noting such exchanges also boost the nation's soft power capacity, which it needs to maintain its influence over its allies.\nBRI is a major infrastructure push launched by the Chinese government, which Beijing envisions would ultimately link all major trade routes across Asia, Europe and Africa.\nPrime location\nDeputy Prime Minister and Commerce Minister, Phumtham Wechayachai, has said Guangxi's location and proximity to Southeast Asia makes it an ideal gateway for Thai agricultural exports to China, such as jasmine rice, durian, grapefruit and longans.\nThe reason, he said, is because the autonomous region is well equipped to handle land and marine cargo shipments, allowing Thai products to reach the markets faster than if they had gone through a different gateway.\nRecently, authorities in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region hosted a China-Asean expo to boost cooperation between Chinese businesses and their Asean counterparts, in which they showcased the region's rapid development and modernisation.\nThe trip was organised by the Propaganda Department of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Guangxi Branch of China News Service.\nKnown for Guilin\nBefore Guangxi became a modern and popular trade hub, it was first known for its natural attractions, chief among which is Guilin, which is world-famous for its beguiling limestone karst formations.\nThe landscape around Guiling is so renowned that it is featured on the 20-yuan banknote, said Ma Tieqiao, chairman of Guilin Junda Transportation Company, which offers leisure cruises along the Li Jiang River.\nIn the past, he said, most tourists would have to get on bamboo rafts, which are only big enough for about three people, or risk getting crammed into a small boat for larger groups.\nAs the number of tourists continue to grow, in 1985 the Guilin Sightseeing Shipping Co was founded to provide improved services for local and international visitors.\nThe move proved to be successful and now scores of leisure boats cruise along the Li Jiang River everyday, he said.\nHome to high-tech industry\nNow, Guilin is increasingly becoming known as a hub for high-tech industries.\nThe rapid transformation started in 1988, when Guilin High-Tech Industrial Development Zone was established. It was upgraded into a high-tech special development zone in 1991, becoming the first national-level high-tech zone across China's five autonomous regions.\nIn just 30 years, Guilin has become one of the leaders in scientific innovation and industrial development.\nOne example of a successful company based in the region is Guangxi Guilin Zhishen Information Technology Company, which produces anti-shake tripods for cameras and other equipment for digital photography, as well as mobile phones.\nThe company has won several awards such as the iF Design Award, the Red Dot Award and the Excellent Design Award, according to the company.\nIn addition, Guigang, which is located in eastern Guangxi, has been designated as a hub for electric vehicle (EV) manufacturers. The city is home to more than 100 EV-related businesses, including e-bike producers, machine components and vehicle parts manufacturers.\nHaving an EV production base in Guigang will give China more opportunities to export its EVs to countries in Southeast Asia, said a representative of Guangxi Luyuan Electric Vehicle Company, which manufactures and distributes electric motorbikes and e-bicycles.\nHe said as the electric vehicle industry has become more popular in the world, the company expects to expand its reach to many countries in Southeast Asia.\nEVs will be a solution for the green energy ecosystem, he said.\nThe Sun and Moon Pagodas are illuminated at night in the Fir Lake, one of popular tourism sites in Guilin.

EU President Ursula von der Leyen told Chinese leader Xi Jinping on Thursday that the bloc and its biggest trading partner must address their differences, as they began the first in-person EU-China summit in over four years.\nChina and the EU have ramped up diplomatic engagement this year in an attempt to steer post-pandemic recovery and repair damaged ties, with a number of its commissioners visiting Beijing to restart high-level dialogue.\nAnd in opening remarks, von der Leyen, flanked by European Council President Charles Michel and EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell, thanked Xi for the \"warm welcome\" on what is her second trip to China this year.\nADVERTISEMENT\nAds powered by\n\"But there are clear imbalances and differences that we must address,\" she said.\nRELATED\nworld\nWar in Ukraine: latest developments\nworld\nChina policeman tells of shooting Kunming attackers\n\"At times our interests coincide,\" she said, pointing to EU-China cooperation on artificial intelligence and climate change.\n\"And when they do not, we need to address and responsibly manage the concerns that we have,\" she said.\nMichel, in turn, said the bloc was seeking a \"stable and mutually beneficial\" relationship with China.\nBut, he said, the EU would also \"promote our European values including human rights and democracy\" at the summit.\nThe bloc says it hopes the meetings will provide a chance to discuss areas of common interest.\nIn his opening remarks, President Xi told his European visitors they must \"jointly respond to global challenges\".\nThursday's talks are set to address more touchy topics too, from human rights and Beijing's continued ties with Russia despite its war in Ukraine to the yawning EU-China trade gap.\nVon der Leyen warned this week that the bloc would \"not tolerate\" that imbalance indefinitely.\n\"We have tools to protect our market,\" she told AFP.\nBeijing hit back on Wednesday, saying the bloc's efforts to curb exports of sensitive tech to China while balancing trade didn't \"make sense\".\nEuropean officials have said repeatedly this year they aim to \"derisk\" their economic ties to China after the war in Ukraine exposed the continent's energy dependence on Russia.\n- 'Zero trust' -\nBeijing's goal this week will be to \"hinder or delay derisking at a minimum cost\", Grzegorz Stec, an analyst at China-focused think tank MERICS, told a media briefing Wednesday.\nBeijing will attempt to \"project the image of a responsible global actor and to reassure European actors about the direction of the Chinese economy\", Stec said.\nBut on the eve of the summit, news broke that Italy had withdrawn from China's vast Belt and Road infrastructure initiative.\nPrime Minister Giorgia Meloni has long been opposed to Italy's participation in an initiative viewed by many as an attempt by Beijing to buy political influence -- and whose economic benefits to Rome were limited.\nAlso on the agenda at the summit will be the fighting between Israel and Hamas -- as well as Russia's war in Ukraine.\nChina, which has not condemned Moscow's February 2022 invasion of its neighbour, welcomed Russian President Vladimir Putin to Beijing in October, with Xi hailing their \"deep friendship\".\nSuch camaraderie is unlikely in Thursday's talks with EU leaders, who one analyst said had \"zero trust\" in Beijing.\n\"Both sides are unlikely to get what they want from the other side,\" Nicholas Bequelin, a senior fellow at Yale's Paul Tsai China Center, told AFP.\n- Few offramps -\nBeijing has said the meeting will \"play an important role in building on the past and ushering in the future\".\n\"China and Europe are partners, not rivals, and their common interests far outweigh their differences,\" foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said this week.\nVon der Leyen and Michel's schedule in the Chinese capital on Thursday will be tight.\nThe EU chiefs' meeting with Xi will be followed by a working lunch.\nThey will then hold talks with Premier Li Qiang before attending an official dinner and a news conference in the evening.\nThe Europeans have said they will urge Beijing to use its ties with Moscow to push it to end its war against Ukraine.\nWhile China has stopped short of providing military aid to Moscow, it has deepened economic ties as Western powers seek to isolate Russia.\nWar in the Middle East and tensions over self-ruled Taiwan will also feature prominently in the talks, the bloc has said.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat is your budget range for renting a condominium?\nUnder 10,000 THB/month\n10,000 -

What we're trying to do is change the relationship for the better,\" Biden told reporters at the White House before heading to San Francisco.\nAsked what he hoped to achieve at the meeting, he said he wanted \"to get back on a normal course of corresponding; being able to pick up the phone and talk to one another if there's a crisis; being able to make sure our (militaries) still have contact with one another.\"\nBut Biden also warned that the United States was wary of investing in China due to Beijing's business practices.\n\"I'm not going to continue to sustain the support for positions where if we want to invest in China, we have to turn over all our trade secrets,\" he said.\nThe two presidents are expected to meet for several hours Wednesday on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in San Francisco.\nThe forum brings together 21 economies, which together account for about 60 percent of the world economy.\nThey are both also expected to meet major business leaders, and hold a number of other bilateral meetings.\n- Spy balloon -\nPositive momentum from November 2022 talks between Xi and Biden in Bali was derailed when the United States shot down what it said was a Chinese spy balloon, delaying a planned visit to Beijing by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken.\nSince then, a flurry of high-level diplomacy, including Blinken's eventual trip to China in June, has signaled a willingness on both sides to mend ties.\nAsked about Beijing's expectations for the summit, a spokesman for China's foreign ministry was vague, mentioning \"in-depth communication\" and \"major issues concerning world peace.\"\nChina routinely warns it will not budge on issues it considers \"red lines,\" such as Taiwan, a self-ruling island off its coast that Beijing claims as its own territory, and its expansion into the South China Sea.\nBut Washington and Beijing have recently made some progress on trade and economic relations, and climate change talks.\nThe United States and its Western allies once viewed emerging China as a friend in waiting, believing that as it became wealthier, it would become more liberal and fit in with the US-dominated global order.\nBut over the last decade that view has all but disappeared in Western capitals as the openness that heralded its hosting of the 2008 Olympic Games has faded.\nBeijing has become more authoritarian under Xi, and has increasingly begun to throw its weight around on the international stage, including spending hundreds of billions of dollars on infrastructure development in third countries as part of its \"Belt and Road\" initiative.\nAt the same time, making nice with China has fallen out of favor in Washington, as domestic politics have taken on an increasingly protectionist bent.\nThat tendency accelerated under former president Donald Trump, who delighted his base by imposing punitive sanctions on Chinese imports in what he said was a bid to re-shore US manufacturing.\nBut the mood music has sweetened slightly in recent months, and Biden said Tuesday a less confrontational relationship with China would benefit both sides.\n\"If in fact the Chinese people, who are in trouble right now economically, if the average homeowner, if the average citizen in China, was able to have a decent paying job -- that benefits them, and benefits all of us,\" Biden said Tuesday.\nXi will have dinner with top US business leaders on his trip, and is expected to push for a relaxation of US trade curbs in his talks with Biden.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat is your budget range for renting a condominium?\nUnder 10,000 THB/month\n10,000 - 20,000 THB/month\n20,000 - 40,000 THB/month\n40,000 - 60,000 THB/month\nOver 60,000 THB/month\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nDo you like the content of this article?\n0\n2\nCOMMENT\n(1)",

They were drawn from media outlets from 17 countries included in China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), and included 17 Muslim journalists.\nA craftsman makes a traditional drum with snakeskin, above, and a traditional musical instrument, below, in Kashi Prefecture of Xinjiang.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe visitors were from the Middle East, Europe, North America, Australia, India and Southeast Asia.

Once a violence-plagued region, Xinjiang is now seen as an important economic area which serves also as a connecting hub for high-speed train routes in the BRI.\nThe Chinese hosts pointed to what they said was freedom of religious practices in Xinjiang, such as development of education, healthcare and housing welfare.\nThey were designed to counter the negative images of Xinjiang and China as a whole by some Western media giants.\nZheng Liang, a Chinese researcher, said the media had been exploited as a tool to make false accusations against China regarding its handling of violence in Xinjiang.\nHe played an audio clip containing a remark by Lawrence Wilkerson, former US chief of staff to former secretary of state Colin Powell and a retired army colonel, when he was speaking at the Ron Paul Institute in August, 2018.\n\"The third reason we were in Afghanistan is because there are 20 million Uighurs in Xinjiang. The CIA would want to destabilise China and that would be the best way to do it, to foment unrest and to join with those Uighurs in pushing the Han Chinese in Beijing,\" the colonel said in the clip.\nMr Zheng also presented an analysis of the BBC's coverage of Xinjiang's past violence which he found to be intentionally distorted.\nOn one occasion, the BBC claimed its correspondent was ordered by the Chinese police to stop filming around a factory said to be a site of forced labour against Uighurs, said Mr Zheng.\nThe truth was the police were actually security guards at the factory and were merely trying to warn the BBC team to wear a face mask during the Covid-19 pandemic.\nOn another occasion, the BBC published mugshots of what it claimed to be 2,000 Xinjiang police found involved in the mass abduction and judicial killing of more than 1,000 Uighurs, he said.\nAs it turned out, two of the mugshots actually belonged to Hong Kong actors, Donald Chow and Andy Lau, he said.\nWang Jiang, a professor and associate dean at the Institute of China's Borderland Studies, Zhejiang Normal University, admitted the reduction in violence in Xinjiang in the past seven years resulted partially from measures imposed to fight Covid-19.\nThey included China's border closures which lasted for over three years and stringent controls on the internet in China which made it almost impossible for outsiders to incite violence through the internet, he said.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat is your budget range for purchasing a condominium?\nUnder 2 million THB\n2 million - 4 million THB\n4 million - 7 million THB\n7 million - 10 million THB\nOver 10 million THB\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nXinjiang\nDo you like the content of this article?\n5\n32\nCOMMENT\n(14)",

That said, speed is not always of the essence when the project in question has a considerable impact on the country.\nOne such scheme is the land bridge, a logistic megaproject which aims to connect the Andaman Sea and the Indian Ocean to the Gulf of Thailand and, ultimately, the Pacific Ocean. The government said the project would be a boon to connectivity in the South and reduce shipping times by allowing ships to bypass the congested Strait of Malacca.\nThe cabinet approved the scheme on Oct 14, and the government plans to launch a roadshow to attract foreign investment. In fact, Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin had already launched his sales pitch at the 10th Anniversary of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) in China last week. He said the project aligns with Beijing's BRI schemes, which will improve China's connectivity to the region and beyond.\nADVERTISEMENT\nIt was reported that the government is considering granting the concession to build and operate the land bridge to a private company. It is estimated the entire project will cost at least one trillion baht to build.\nRELATED\nworld\nLast marine heat wave providing lessons for the future\nthailand\nPhatthalung to push airport plan\nWhile the project looks good on paper, the government must carefully weigh its pros and cons. It must be noted that the land bridge isn't exactly a novel idea. The first plan to carve out a route to connect Thailand's east and west coasts was conceived over 300 years ago.\nThe idea to excavate a canal across the Isthmus of Kra between Chumphon and Ranong persisted for centuries, but each time the plan resurfaced, it was struck down over national security concerns.\nAfter all, if built, the canal would physically divide the kingdom in two.\nThe Kra Canal proposal was revived by the Prayut Chan-o-cha administration, which revised it slightly to minimise the need to split the country into two parts by swapping the canal for a \"land bridge\" supported by high-speed rail and land transport connections.\nThe problem, as such, no longer concerns national security but economic viability.\nOver the past five decades, various governments have commissioned around 15 studies to look into the feasibility of building such a canal and whether or not shipping companies would use it to bypass the Malacca Strait.\nThe majority, however, concluded the scheme's economic benefits were overstated.\nThe Prayut administration also had the National Economic and Social Development Council and Chulalongkorn University conduct their own feasibility study of the project. In the end, both suggested the government improve the existing logistics infrastructure instead.\nThis time, the government must determine if the scheme is just a pipe dream or a promising logistic project. It must bear in mind that the Andaman Sea is a priceless tourism resource which must be protected from delusional mega projects.\nThat means the government needs to listen to experts' questions and criticisms.\nOne of the questions that needs to be answered is whether or not shipping companies will use the land bridge, as they must pay extra costs and spend time to load and unload containers from the docks to the land bridge before they can reach their final destination.\nThe Srettha government must not act like a salesman who focuses solely on selling goods. It needs to carefully choose which development project will benefit the country the most.\nEditorial\nBangkok Post editorial column\nThese&nbsp;editorials represent Bangkok Post&nbsp;thoughts about current issues and situations.\nEmail :\nanchaleek@bangkokpost.co.th\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat type of hotel location do you prefer in Thailand?\nBeachfront resorts\nCity-center hotels (close to shopping, restaurants, attractions\nSecluded, nature retreats\nNear airports for convenience\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nLand bridge\nDo you like the content of this article?\n58\n2\nCOMMENT\n(28)",

The European Union (EU) and the US, meanwhile, are seeking to de-risk to limit their reliance on the world's second-largest economy.\nADVERTISEMENT\nAds powered by\nChina and Serbia began talk of a deal in April, including two rounds of formal negotiation and nearly 30 work-level conferences, and signed the agreement on Tuesday at the sidelines of the Third Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation in Beijing.\n\"China and Serbia will realise high-level opening up to each other via the free trade deal, set up new institutional arrangements for bilateral trade and economic cooperation, and create a more preferential, convenient, transparent and stable business environment,\" China's Ministry of Commerce said on Wednesday, adding the deal will \"promote investment, forge closer supply chains and enhance global competitiveness\".\nBilateral trade rose one-tenth in 2022 to US$3.56 billion from the previous year, official data showed.

This includes transport, energy, and infrastructure.\nNew technologies and digital transformation will be invaluable to this shift, but their responsible use and equitable access must be ensured, he said.\n\"For our part, Thailand is actively implementing our long-term low greenhouse gas emission development strategy. We have realigned our national energy plan to shift consumption to clean energy, and also promote energy efficiency.\n\"We aim to increase the production of zero-emission vehicles to 30% by 2030, while encouraging foreign investment in the electric vehicle sector. We also plan to scale up sustainable agronomy to reduce climate change vulnerability and improve farmers' well-being.\n\"I am optimistic that these policies will help us reach our national targets of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 40% by 2030, achieving carbon neutrality by 2050, and net-zero emissions by 2065,'' he said.\nSecond, Mr Srettha said Thailand recognises the importance of environmental and ecosystem conservation.\nA sketch by Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin shows where the Land Bridge project has been designated. He introduced it to a group of Chinese business leaders on the sidelines of the 3rd Belt and Road Forum (BRF) for International Cooperation in Beijing on Tuesday.\nHe said the country aims to expand green areas up to 55% of the country's total area. As for marine and coastal biodiversity, the nation is committed to the \"30 by 30 Target\" for protected areas, he said, citing a pledge made at COP15 in Montreal, Canada, in December 2022.\nThailand believes that sustainable blue economy will be crucial to achieve a Green Maritime Silk Road, he added.\nThird, an environmentally sound financing mechanism will be an indispensable tool for the green transition. Thailand has raised US$12.5 billion so far by issuing sustainability bonds to fund multiple projects. Soon the government will introduce sustainability linked bonds to boost the green bonds market, Mr Srettha said.\nThis will also incentivise all entities to support the private sector and MSMEs as they engage in eco-friendly businesses.\nMr Srettha said on the 10th anniversary of the BRI, he commended China for the achievements made under the wildly ambitious scheme. This globe-spanning infrastructure project, still in its early stage, has already brought prosperity to millions of people.\nDespite being a relatively small nation, Thailand aims to take lessons from this mega-project and implement these at home where possible, he said.\nJust recently, the Thai cabinet affirmed a study and implementation plan for the Land Bridge project. This will connect the Andaman Sea and the Indian Ocean to the Gulf of Thailand and the Pacific Ocean, improving connectivity in the southern Andaman region. It will also reduce commute times going via the Strait of Malacca.\nGovernment spokesman Chai Wacharonke said on Wednesday&nbsp;that China Harbour Engineering Company Limited (CHEC), one of the country's top engineering firms, is interested in joining Thailand's southern Land Bridge megaproject, worth an estimated 1 trillion baht.\nCHEC chairman Wang Tongzhou expressed interest during a meeting with Mr Srettha on the sidelines of the BRF.\nMr Srettha welcomed the firm's enthusiasm and urged it to hold talks with the Board of Investment (BOI) to learn more about investment privileges.\nHe also asked the company to consider opening a regional office in Thailand. The timeline for the project includes an overseas roadshow from November to January to drum up foreign investment.

It seems as though there is a concerted effort to cast a shadow over this monumental endeavour.\nIn the prevailing discourse on the BRI, Western think tanks have raised concerns regarding its potential environmental impact along its expansive route. They argue that the BRI must align with the Paris Agreement and prioritise environmental sustainability.\nADVERTISEMENT\nHowever, it is crucial to evaluate the BRI from a balanced standpoint that recognises its immense potential benefits, as well as China's steadfast dedication to environmental safety. While it is undeniable that the Belt and Road Initiative's construction activities may have an impact on the environment, it is essential to acknowledge that similar challenges are prevalent in all the development projects worldwide.\nChina's commitment to a green economy and its capacity to address environmental concerns along the BRI route set an example. While these concerns are valid, it is essential to recognise that construction and development projects are ongoing worldwide, irrespective of the BRI's existence. Hence, the demand for environmentally friendly policies should not be limited to the BRI alone.\nRELATED\nlife\nCelebrate a sustainable and giving festive season\nthailand\nR.X. reinforces leadership in health via RXLIFE&nbsp;at Sustainability Forum 2025\nChina, the driving force behind the BRI, is actively transitioning towards a green economy. This commitment reflects China's leadership in balancing economic development with environmental responsibility on a global scale.\nAs the BRI continues to shape the global landscape, its expansion into various dimensions, including the Digital Silk Road, Health Silk Road, and Polar Silk Road, underscores the initiative's evolving nature and commitment to addressing pressing global challenges.\nAmong these dimensions, the Green Silk Road stands out as a beacon of hope for a world grappling with environmental crises and the urgent need for sustainable development. The Green Silk Road, a crucial component of the BRI, represents China's resolute commitment to making its projects greener and more sustainable. The world is increasingly prioritising sustainable development as the need to address climate change and environmental degradation becomes more urgent. The Green Silk Road serves as an effective solution for implementing the UN's 2030 Agenda. To fulfil these ambitious targets, China recognises the importance of promoting sustainability not only within its borders but also in the regions connected through the BRI.\nChina has actively promoted the Green Silk Road through the establishment of guidelines and partnership agreements. The Green Investment Principles (GIP) for the BRI, introduced in late 2018, provide a framework for greener investments in BRI participant countries and regions. In mid-2021, China published the Green Development Guidelines for Overseas Investment and Cooperation, as well as the Guidelines for Ecological and Environmental Protection of Foreign Investment Cooperation and Construction Projects. These programmes focus on managing environmental risks associated with overseas BRI projects and supply chains, further underlining China's commitment to sustainability.\nA key aspect of China's commitment to sustainability within the BRI is the shift away from coal-related investments. Conversely, China has significantly increased its investments in renewable energy, including solar, wind, and hydropower within BRI-involved regions. In 2022, investments in these green energy sectors saw a 50% year-on-year increase. China's dominance in renewable energy manufacturing, accounting for 72% of global solar manufacturing and 50% of global wind turbine manufacturing, positions it as a crucial contributor to low-carbon technologies for BRI countries and regions.\nCollaboration between Chinese officials, local governments, and corporations in BRI-involved regions has also led to the development of green infrastructure. In the sphere of environmental conservation, China has demonstrated its commitment by engaging in approximately 50 agreements with stakeholders within the BRI framework over the past decade.\nMoreover, in 2021, China's total renewable energy use reached 750 million tonnes of standard coal, leading to a reduction of 2.1 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions. At the same time, China holds the distinction of being the global leader in the production of solar panels, wind turbines, batteries, and electric vehicles (EVs). This status uniquely positions China to facilitate the delivery of cutting-edge, low-carbon technologies to the Emerging Markets and Developing Economies (EMDEs) engaged in the BRI. Currently, the GIP boasts more than 41 signatories with combined assets exceeding US$49 trillion, providing substantial funding for BRI projects. The Green Silk Road within the BRI represents a forward-looking commitment to sustainability, environmental protection, and global cooperation. Contrary to the negative framing by Western critics, the actual reality of the BRI is quite different from this narrative. China's dedication to sustainable development through the Green Silk Road offers a compelling vision for the future of global infrastructure and connectivity.\nDr Imran Khalid is a freelance contributor based in Karachi, Pakistan.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat hotel facilities are most important to you when choosing accommodation?\nSwimming pool\nFitness center\nRestaurants and bars\nMassage and spa\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nSustainability\nDo you like the content of this article?\n6\n16\nCOMMENT",

(Photo: AFP)\nBEIJING - Chinese President Xi Jinping hailed his close friendship with Vladimir Putin on Wednesday as he hosted the Russian leader for talks that celebrated their nations' deepening political and economic ties.\nPutin, on his first trip to a major global power since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, met his \"old friend\" Xi at Beijing's Great Hall of the People on the sidelines of a major forum.\n\"The political mutual trust between the two countries is continuously deepening,\" Xi said, according to Xinhua news agency, hailing their \"close and effective strategic coordination\".\nADVERTISEMENT\nXi noted that he had met with Putin 42 times in the past decade, saying they had \"developed a good working relationship and a deep friendship\".\nRELATED\nworld\nSouth America hails new BRICS bank\nworld\nSouth America hails new BRICS bank\nPutin is the guest of honour at a summit hosted by Xi in Beijing to celebrate his Belt and Road Initiative, a vast trade and infrastructure project.\nDespite international attention focused on the Israel-Gaza conflict, neither Xi nor Putin made public comments on the war that has raged for more than 10 days.\nThe Chinese president did, however, call for joint efforts by China and Russia to \"safeguard international fairness\" and \"justice\", Xinhua said.\nChina is Russia's largest trading partner, with exchange between the nations reaching a record $190 billion last year, Beijing customs data shows.\nAnd Xi said Wednesday it was progressing towards a goal of $200 billion set by the two countries in bilateral meetings this year.\nBeijing has drawn criticism from Western countries for its stance on the Ukraine war, on which China insists it is neutral. It has refused to criticise Moscow's invasion.\nPutin is on a mission to strengthen the already strong bond with his communist neighbour, though experts say Moscow is increasingly the junior partner in the relationship.\nIn his talks with \"dear friend\" Xi, he stressed the importance of \"close coordination in foreign policy\" in \"the current difficult conditions\".\n\"And we are doing it, and today we will discuss this,\" Putin was quoted as saying in a Kremlin readout.\nChina's state broadcaster CCTV reported shortly before 3pm that the tete-a-tete had finished, carrying footage of Putin being whisked away in a motorcade.\n'Oppose unilateral sanctions'\nRepresentatives of 130 countries including Thailand are in the Chinese capital for the two-day talking shop that wraps up on Wednesday.\nEarlier Xi said in a speech to the international delegates that his country rejected \"economic coercion\" and \"bloc confrontation\".\nIn an apparent reference to China's rivalry with the United States, Xi said Beijing would not engage in \"ideological confrontation, geopolitical games or bloc confrontation\".\n\"We oppose unilateral sanctions, economic coercion, decoupling and delinking,\" Xi told delegates.\n\"Viewing the development of others as a threat and economic interdependence as a risk will not make one's own life any better or one's own development any faster,\" he said.\nInstead, Xi said, the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) would seek to \"inject new impetus into the global economy\".\n\"We deeply believe that only when there is win-win cooperation can things get done, and get done well,\" he said.\nHe also pledged to inject over $100 billion of new funding into BRI projects.\nPutin then took to the stage, hailing the infrastructure initiative as a \"success story\".\n\"Given the global dimensions of the initiative the Chinese leader launched a decade ago, frankly, one could hardly expect to make it work,\" Putin said in his address to delegates.\n\"Our Chinese friends are making it work. We are glad to see this success story as it means a lot to many of us.\"\nAt an official banquet on Tuesday, Xi delivered a toast in which he alluded to recent conflicts, but added that \"the historical (trend) of peace\" was \"unstoppable\".\nMiddle East envoy\nThe United States has asked China to use its influence to help de-escalate the Israel-Hamas conflict, which erupted after the Palestinian militant group launched an attack in Israel, killing 1,400 people.\nIsrael then launched a withering air campaign against Gaza, which has seen more than a million people in the blockaded territory flee their homes. About 3,000 Gazans have died in Israeli bombardments, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.\nChina, which brokered a detente between key Hamas backer Iran and its regional foe Saudi Arabia this year, said it would send its Middle East envoy Zhai Jun to the volatile region this week.\nNo details have been given about where or when exactly Zhai would travel, though CCTV has said he will push for a ceasefire and peace talks.\nRussia, which has traditionally maintained good relations with both Israeli and Palestinian authorities, has called for an \"immediate ceasefire\" in the conflict.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat type of house are you most interested in?\nSingle-family home\nTownhouse\nSemi-detached house\nVilla\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nDo you like the content of this article?\n2\n0\nCOMMENT",

Thailand should harness the opportunity, he said.\nMr Narongsak said Thailand enjoys close ties with China while Thailand and the US have always been good allies. He believes the new government led by Srettha Thavisin will help balance the power of the two global leaders and maintain positive trade ties with both. Thailand should remain neutral in their conflict, he said.\nRELATED\nworld\nKorean lawmakers try again to impeach president\nlife\nUnwrap the festive magic at Moxy Bangkok Ratchaprasong\n\"From an economic perspective, Thailand should find opportunities in the [US-China] crisis so we can have access to larger markets,\" Mr Narongsak said.\nThailand may have a relatively small production capacity but when Chinese firms invest in the country, that will rise, he said.\nAsked if Thailand would benefit if Chinese companies invest here but repatriate all their earnings, he said Thailand has laws that must be enforced. For example, foreign companies that have a business in Thailand must let Thai shareholders control at least 51% of their company.\nThey also need to pay, except those granted tax incentives from the Board of Investment or the Eastern Economic Corridor.\n\"There is no need to be overly concerned because any business needs to pay tax. In addition, when authorities strictly enforce laws, it scares away shady Chinese businesses from coming to Thailand,\" he said.\nThe trade deficit with China is not a big issue because Thailand can use imported materials from China to produce goods and later export them to other countries.\nMr Narongsak also referred to Thai firms that want to invest in China, saying the Chinese government has special economic zones (SEZ) to welcome foreign investors such as SEZs in Hainan and Zhuhai.\nHe suggested investing in businesses that Thailand is known for, such as the food industry. If a Thai company can sell even one product in China, it would open a huge potential market because of its 1.4 billion population.\nHe also praised the government for launching a visa-exception scheme for Chinese nationals. The policy is timely as it was launched before Chinese National Day on Oct 1, which is a marked with a week-long holiday.\nMr Narongsak said the government should expedite its high-speed railway project as it has some missing segments that would link it to the China-Laos high-speed railway project built under China's Belt and Road Initiative.\n\"The high-speed project may not be finished in the term of the Srettha government. But the government should speed up a double-track railway project and urgently complete the 160km segment from Khon Kaen to Nong Khai, on the border to Laos, to improve the country's logistics crossing from Laos to China,\" he said.\nMr Narongsak said the dual-track railway system will enable passenger trains to run faster at a maximum speed of 110km per hour. Trains will not have to change tracks -- an inconvenience of the present single railway system -- while a cargo train can run at 70km/h.\nThe dual track railway system will allow trains to run at speeds almost on par with the average speed of 160km/h marked by the China-Laos high-speed train, he said.\nHe also suggested the government consider opening the customs service in Nong Khai and other border checkpoints around the clock, as well as providing a one-stop service to ease cross-border trade.\nThis step could be completed within a year, while waiting for the dual-track railway system to be finished, he said.\n\"I had a chance to talk with the premier and asked him to extend the working hours along the borders as Thailand would earn more income from collecting fees from land and sea freight,\" he said.\nMr Narongsak said the relationship between Thailand and China has improved, especially after Chinese President Xi Jinping paid courtesy calls to His Majesty the King and then Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha last year.\nMore Chinese business operators, particularly those in northern China, are aware of the advantages Thailand offers after the TCCC held the World Chinese Entrepreneurs Convention for overseas Chinese entrepreneurs in June.\nThe event attracted more than 4,000 Chinese businesspeople from 50 countries.\nThailand should also offer an attractive investment policy to compete with neighbouring countries, such as Vietnam, Indonesia, Cambodia and Malaysia.\n\"We should let Chinese investors know that they may invest in other countries but Thailand is the best because our country is stable and safe,\" Mr Narongsak said.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat is your budget range for renting a condominium?\nUnder 10,000 THB/month\n10,000 - 20,000 THB/month\n20,000 - 40,000 THB/month\n40,000 - 60,000 THB/month\nOver 60,000 THB/month\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nTrade\nThai-Chinese\nInvestment\nUS\nConflict\nChina\nDo you like the content of this article?\n4\n110\nCOMMENT\n(18)",

An example of this is China's joining of the Brics bloc (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) to counter the influence of the United States and countries in Europe, he said.\nADVERTISEMENT\nBric (without South Africa) was created in 2001, with the hopes that the four countries would dominate the global economy by 2050, he said. South Africa was added to the list in 2010, he said, adding Brics operates as a loose organisation that seeks to further economic cooperation among member nations and increase their global standing, in contrast to Western powers.\nBrics nations have offered to become a source of foreign expansion for firms with strong returns for institutional investors, he said.\nMr Pinit said in terms of power, the world no longer only has the US and Europe. These days, many countries must remain on good terms with China, especially in relation to its Belt and Road Initiative, which aims to drive trade, investments and culture across regions, he said.\nToday, even the Chinese language is popular among people, particularly in African countries and Thailand, he said.\nThis year's National Day celebration will mark China's progress in tackling past issues, such as poverty and starvation, and in becoming one of the world's leading countries, praising the leadership of founder Mao Zedong and current President Xi Jinping, he said.\nIn its prosperity, China has also provided a variety of assistance to many underdeveloped countries in Asia, the Middle East, Africa and South America, he said.\nTherefore, China has played an important role in promoting the global economy, and its policies tend to have a wide international impact, he said. Its large population also impacts the consumption trends of many products, he added.\nOver the 74 years since its founding, basic infrastructure in China has significantly improved, Mr Pinit said. China now has a 20,000 km-long high-speed railway and an expressway network of almost 50,000km, he said.\nIn terms of human resources, China has always attached importance to education, as it believes education plays a key role in shaping the future of its new generation of people of at least 4\u20135 million per year, he said.\nDue to the US-China trade war, the US banned the exports of chips and software to Chinese technology giants, but China retaliated by manufacturing a 7-nanometre chip, he said.\n\"Now, we must look to the future of China as a country that has surpassed many leading countries in technology, including electric cars,\" Mr Pinit said.\nTCCRC's mission\nAsked about the promotion of Thai-China relations via the TCCRC, Mr Pinit said the council first established ties with China in 1976 with cooperation from the Chinese government and the private sector.\nThe TCCRC has also cooperated with China to host a number of events with state officials every year to promote both Thai tourism and exchanges of culture and trade, he said.\nHe said his association has taken part in helping the Thai government promote the One Tambon One Product and Thailand's small and medium-sized enterprises in many Chinese provinces.\nIn the future, the TCCRC will help the government organise a roadshow to promote Thai products and art in Shanghai, he said.\nWhen it comes to tourism promotion, Mr Pinit said relevant state agencies and members of the private sector must help the government come up with new and effective ideas on how to attract more Chinese tourists to visit the country every year.\nHe said he agrees with the government's visa-free policy for Chinese tourists as they are more likely to go on long holidays during National Day and Chinese New Year.\nThailand's role\nAccording to the experts, Thailand must tighten its cooperation with China and its Asean and Greater Mekong neighbours, and Mr Pinit agrees.\n\"We should change the way we see China because of its advancements in technology and elevated education,\" he said.\n\"Thailand must be friendly with every country and act as a centre network to promote reconciliation.\"\nAsked about the new government's positive stance on China, Mr Pinit said Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin and Foreign Affairs Minister Parnpree Bahiddha-Nukara are competent people who understand the ins and outs of China.\nThe government should work closely with Beijing to promote Thai exports in China, he said.\n\"The government must closely work with China to promote [agricultural] products, as well as tourism between the two countries,\" he said.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat type of condominium are you most interested in?\nStudio\n1-bedroom\n2-bedroom\n3-bedroom\nPenthouse\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nDo you like the content of this article?\n2\n11\nCOMMENT",

He and other foreign leaders will meet there with Xi, Chinese state broadcaster CCTV said.\nAccording to the Syrian presidency, he will also visit Beijing.\nThe visit will be Assad's first to China since 2004.\nBeijing has long provided Damascus with diplomatic support, particularly at the UN Security Council where it is a permanent member.\nOfficials from both countries have also made visits over the years.\n\"This visit represents an important rupture in the diplomatic isolation and the political siege imposed on Syria,\" Damascus-based political scientist Oussama Dannoura told AFP.\n\"China has been breaking Western taboos that seek to prevent a number of states from dealing with countries that Washington considers isolated,\" he added.\n- Growing presence -\nThe visit comes as China expands its engagement in the Middle East.\nEarlier this year Beijing brokered a deal that saw longtime regional rivals Saudi Arabia and Damascus backer Iran agree to restore ties and reopen their respective embassies.\nThe detente was followed by Syria's return to the Arab fold at a summit in Saudi Arabia in May, ending more than a decade of Damascus's regional isolation.\nIn 2019, top diplomat Wang Yi told the country's then-foreign minister Walid Muallem that China \"firmly supports Syria's economic reconstruction\" and its efforts to \"combat terrorism\".\nSyria's war began after Assad's repression of peaceful pro-democracy protests escalated into a deadly conflict that pulled in foreign powers and jihadists.\nAssad's regime has branded all opponents -- from non-violent activists to armed rebels and jihadists -- as \"terrorists\".\n\"Assad intends for his trip to China to convey a sense of international legitimacy for his regime and paint a picture of looming Chinese support for reconstruction in Syria,\" said Lina Khatib, director of the Middle East Institute at SOAS.\nKhatib noted that the timing is significant, with Assad now facing protests calling for regime change in southern Syria.\n\"It is unlikely that either (intention) will be convincing to an increasingly restive population in Sweida,\" added Khatib, referring to a Syrian city where protests are ongoing.\n- Economic aid -\nRecent months have seen Beijing roll out the red carpet for a string of autocrats, from Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko to a delegation of officials from Afghanistan's Taliban government.\nAnd foreign minister Wang is this week in Moscow, which faces a raft of Western sanctions over its war in Ukraine.\nAfter welcoming Xi in Moscow earlier this year, Russian President Vladimir Putin is planning a visit to China in October, the Kremlin has said.\nAnalysts expect Assad's visit to China will focus, in part, on funds for reconstruction.\nSyria signed up to China's vast Belt and Road trade and infrastructure initiative in January 2022.\nHaid Haid, a Consulting Fellow at London's Chatham House, wrote on X that \"the focus of this meeting is expected to revolve around convincing China to aid Syria's economic recovery\".\nChina pledged $2 billion in investments in Syria in 2017, Haid noted -- funds that have \"yet to materialise\".\nFor Syria, joining the BRI \"hasn't resulted in significant Chinese investments in Syria, either from the Chinese government or the private sector\", he said.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat type of condominium are you most interested in?\nStudio\n1-bedroom\n2-bedroom\n3-bedroom\nPenthouse\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nDo you like the content of this article?\n0\n1\nCOMMENT\n(2)",

That helps explain why Indonesian President Joko Widodo or Jokowi has to reiterate that Asean needs an extraordinary tactical strategy to face the current global turmoil when he met on Friday with a group of high-level Asean businessmen and investors.\nIt is a well-known fact that the Asean region is and will be the world's fastest-growing economy. It is also peaceful. Therefore, it is up to Asean to draw on the group's collective wisdom, and perhaps, at the right time, it can call the shots.\nPresident Jokowi also emphasised that Asean needs solid collaboration that prioritises mutual interests, both in relations between countries, between entrepreneurs, and between communities. Indeed, at the numerous summits being held this week, Indonesia has the opportunity to show off its diplomatic clout as the world's third-largest democracy and the bloc's largest economy. Throughout past chairmanships, Jakarta has been well aware of its perceived leadership role, both within Asean and in the global context. Most importantly, Jakarta is willing to punch above its weight.\nADVERTISEMENT\nBefore the 43rd summit begins, the 10 Asean leaders will kick off the two-day Asean Indo-Pacific Forum (AIPF), its flagship event. The chair wants to implement the Asean Outlook on the Indo-Pacific (AOIP) after a delay of more than three years. The guidelines were launched in Bangkok during the Thai chairmanship in 2019, just before the Covid-19 outbreak.\nRELATED\nthailand\nNT Highlights Role as ASEAN Digital Hub at TELECOMS WORLD ASIA 2024\nworld\nIndonesia to build 75 GW of renewable energy in next 15 years\nCurrently, there are at least 12 Indo-Pacific frameworks. It is about time Asean reins this in by mainstreaming the AOIP. The AIPF is designed to serve as a platform for all high-level stakeholders, including regional and international officials and representatives, the private sector and others, to meet, connect and match. The inaugural forum will discuss and showcase projects related to infrastructure, digital transformation and the creative economy, as well as sustainable and innovative financing. It is hoped that the forum will later be expanded to cover all areas of priorities under the AOIP, which also include maritime cooperation, connectivity and economic cooperation.\nKey leaders from the dialogue partners are on the list of speakers. US Vice President Kamala Harris is scheduled to attend and give a speech to highlight the US commitment to the region. She has to carry the burden of face-saving for President Joe Biden, who decided to skip the Asean summit even though he is in the neighbourhood.\nGiven the importance of the Indo-Pacific strategy, his absence shows the White House's lack of genuine commitment. Apart from Ms Harris, the forum has lined up heads of governments from Asean's dialogue partners, including China, Japan, South Korea, Australia and Canada. These leaders, who attended the other Asean-related summit, have never missed the opportunity to rub shoulders with others to forge closer ties and cooperation. At the summit, China and Asean plan to issue a joint statement on Mutually Beneficial Cooperation between the AOIP and the Belt and Road Initiative. Although China is still reluctant to accept the concept of the Indo-Pacific, Beijing would like to cooperate with the AOIP on specific projects, especially on connectivity and sustainability. Asean and India will sign a joint statement on maritime cooperation. Before the Asean leaders meet with their dialogue partners on Thursday, they will have their own retreat touching on regional and international issues. Top of the agenda will be the crisis in Myanmar, the South China Sea, the Ukraine-Russia war, and the Korean Peninsula.\nHowever, the ongoing headlines related to Fukushima's wastewater release and the latest Chinese map could dominate Asean leaders' two-hour exchange of views. On the Myanmar quagmire, the chair is expected to issue a statement of Asean leaders' reviews and decisions on the implementation of the Five-point Consensus (5PC). Over the past nine months under Indonesian chairmanship, Asean members have been engaging with all stakeholders on both sides of the conflict. The aims are to instil trust and confidence, build a conducive environment, and narrow gaps and differences to achieve an inclusive dialogue for a comprehensive political solution. The planned statement will also contain concrete, practical and measurable indicators with specific timelines to support activities and programmes under the 5PC. Indonesia is anxious to show the progress it has made during the past nine months through the Office of Asean Special Envoy on Myanmar.\nIn Jakarta, the Asean leaders will have more than a dozen summit meetings over the two-day period with dialogue partners, including the UN and the Asean Plus Three. There will be 21 outcome documents for the Asean Summit and related meetings. The main one will be the Jakarta Declaration: Asean Matters: Epicentrum of Growth, which prescribes joint commitment to promoting Asean centrality, maintaining Asean's role in the region, and operationalising the AOIP. In addition, other documents to be endorsed by the Asean leaders are related to human rights, early childhood educational care development, assistance for people with disabilities and gender equality and family development.\nFurthermore, Canada will have its first summit with the Asean leaders to mark its new status as a strategic partner. Obviously, the global focus then will turn to the outcome of the 18th East Asia Summit (EAS), which comes two months earlier than the previous arrangement. Jakarta did so to accommodate Mr Biden's earlier proposed schedules. Therefore, given its time-sensitive nature, issues chosen by the EAS leaders will also be different and reflect the current situation as those discussed by the Asean leaders. Both the Fukushima affair and the Chinese map will certainly be taken up by some of the EAS leaders. At the EAS in Phnom Penh last year, the tense discussions over the Ukraine-Russia war failed to reach a consensus over the chairman's statement, leaving some of the EAS members to come out with their own leader statements. This time around, Jakarta is doing something different, reiterating that there will be a single EAS leaders' statement by the chair. The purpose is to end confusion and strengthen Asean centrality.\nIndeed, Asean centrality will be further bolstered if all Asean members agree to permit China to accede to the 1995 Treaty of Southeast Asia Nuclear Weapons Free Zone (SEANWFZ). China has reaffirmed time and time again its desire to do so without any reservations. Jakarta hopes Beijing's signature will pave the way for other nuclear powers to make a similar step. However, one of the chair's biggest deliverables has been dashed due to the lack of consensus.\nAsean has been trying in vain for 28 years to persuade the Big Five on the UN Security Council to join the treaty. A new idea has emerged lately after a review of China's intention to attract the remaining nuclear powers to sign up along with their often-stated reservations. All things considered, the Indonesian chair has been quite forceful in boosting the bloc's resilience and capacity to face emerging challenges or disruptions in all dimensions. The question remains whether the incoming Asean chairs will be able to stay on track with the same dynamism.\nKavi Chongkittavorn\nA veteran journalist on regional affairs\nKavi Chongkittavorn is a veteran journalist on regional affairs\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWould you consider buying a house in a gated community or as a standalone property?\nGated community\nStandalone house\nEither, depending on location and price\nNo preference\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nAsean summit\nDo you like the content of this article?\n1\n21\nCOMMENT\n(3)",

This system will be available to all sectors, including producers and partners, enhancing sustainability and transparency in the industry using world-class technology. The initiative reinforces CP\u2019s policy of \u201cno purchase or import of animal feed corn from deforested or burnt areas.\u201d\nYangon, Myanmar \u2013 October 24, 2024\nCharoen Pokphand Group (CP), through Charoen Pokphand Produce (CPP) and Bangkok Produce (BKP), has joined forces with public and private sector partners in Myanmar to launch a traceability system for corn produced by CP for animal feed. This system will be available to producers, partners, and relevant organisations across the supply chain, marking a significant step towards sustainability in Myanmar\u2019s corn industry. A press conference was held in Yangon to announce the project, which includes a pledge not to purchase corn from areas affected by burning or deforestation. The event, held under the Myanmar Corn Traceability Project, included notable attendees such as Mr Mongkol Visittsthumph, Thai Ambassador to Myanmar; Mr Akwat Thanaprasitpattan, Minister Counsellor (Commercial) in Yangon; Mr Titi Lujintanon, Chief Executive Officer of CP\u2019s Feed Ingredients Business; Mr Worrasit Sithiwichai, Chief Operating Officer of Myanmar\u2019s Integrated Crop Business; and Mr U Aye Chan Aung, President of the Myanmar Corn Industrial Association (MCIA). Myanmar corn farmers from areas such as Naung Taya, Shan State, and Mandalay, were also present. The project has garnered support from both Thai and Myanmar participants, all expressing their intent to use the traceability system to foster transparency and sustainability in the Myanmar corn industry.\nMr Mongkol Visittsthumph, the Thai Ambassador to Yangon, stated that this collaboration to enhance traceability in Myanmar\u2019s corn industry is an important step in supporting Thailand\u2019s \u201cClear Sky\u201d strategy, aimed at tackling cross-border haze and PM2.5 pollution from forest burning. The traceability systems showcase private sector responsibility towards the environment, contributing to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly by protecting terrestrial ecosystems and mitigating the effects of climate change. This commitment aligns with the Thai government\u2019s efforts to promote sustainability across the region, reflecting a genuine desire to set new standards in agricultural sectors and promote long-term sustainability.\nMr Akwat Thanaprasitpattan, Minister Counsellor (Commercial) in Yangon, emphasised the importance of traceability in building international trade confidence, saying, \u201cThe introduction of a traceability system that is accessible and beneficial to all will help Myanmar\u2019s corn gain greater acceptance in the global market, particularly in markets that prioritise sustainability and transparent production practices.\u201d\nRELATED\nthailand\nC.P. Group Partners with Zhejiang University to Drive Innovation\nbusiness\nCPF profits surge by 504%  to B7.3bn in third quarter\nAdditionally, Mr Titi Lujintanon, Chief Executive Officer of CP\u2019s Feed Ingredients Business, commented, \u201cTo ensure clarity, transparency, and alignment with CP Group\u2019s sustainable development goals, the traceability system for corn used for animal feed is a vital tool that will elevate Myanmar\u2019s corn industry to meet international standards. The system requires collaboration from all sectors, especially the MCIA, as well as Myanmar traders and farmers. We are opening this system to all sectors to participate in building a sustainable corn supply chain in Myanmar led by the Myanmar people. This is a success story of the traceability system developed by CP Group and expanded through cooperation with Myanmar.\u201d\nAs a leader in agriculture, CPP (Charoen Pokphand Produce) plays a key role in promoting sustainable farming. Mr Worrasit Sithiwichai, Chief Operating Officer of Myanmar\u2019s Integrated Crop Business, noted, \u201cCPP is committed to developing a traceability system that not only helps trace the origin of corn but also supports farmers in accessing technology and environmentally friendly farming practices. We have collaborated with BKP to integrate this system into both production and marketing, enabling farmers and corn traders to effectively connect with markets in Thailand and beyond.\u201d\nCPP, a company in CP Group\u2019s Integrated Crop Business, has also been certified by Control Union, an international organisation renowned for its stringent standards in independent audits across many industries, particularly agriculture. CPP and BKP have accordingly received Control Union certification to roll out the traceability system for corn used as animal feed in Myanmar, underlining the transparency and reliability it will bring to the supply chain.\nBy enabling the corn\u2019s origin to be tracked at every step of the production process, the adoption of this system is a clear sign of the partnership\u2019s shared commitment to operating to the highest standards of sustainable agriculture. CPP and BKP are ready to expand this system to include producers, partners, and other stakeholders, aiming to elevate regional agriculture to new levels of sustainability and transparency in the immediate future.\nCP\u2019s traceability system, open to all sectors including producers, partners, farmers, and relevant organisations, utilises technology that tracks and verifies the origin of corn used for animal feed. First developed in 2023, the system incorporates blockchain technology, satellite imagery, and satellite heat detection to monitor supply chain data, from planting to export. This ensures that buyers can confidently source corn grown in safe, ethical conditions (in accordance with GEUDR 2020 standards), rather than from traditional and protected forest areas or burned cornfields.\nFurthermore, the system promotes transparency for all involved parties. MCIA (Myanmar Corn Industrial Association) will support and encourage its members, including traders and corn exporters, to participate in the system to link purchasing data from traders and farmers within the system. This will strengthen confidence in the origin of raw corn materials and raise production standards towards sustainability.\nMr U Aye Chan Aung, President of MCIA, said, \u201cWe believe that the launch of this system presents a great opportunity to clearly demonstrate the transparency of corn sourcing to buyers, thereby enhancing market confidence both domestically and internationally. MCIA is ready to advocate full cooperation from our members to encourage all farmers to join this system.\u201d\nA representative from Naung Taya village, Shan State, who participated in the project, shared their experience, saying, \u201cJoining the system was not as complicated as we had expected. The company provided guidance and technology that allowed us to farm sustainably. Our community now enjoys more stable lines of income thanks to the clearer market access we now enjoy.\u201d\nThe announcement of this collaboration under the Myanmar Corn Traceability Project has received support from various sectors, including the public sector, private companies, local farmers, and international audit organisations. The transparent and inclusive traceability system is set to become a cornerstone of efforts to bring increased sustainability and trust to Myanmar\u2019s corn industry and is expected to serve as a model for other industries to follow.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat hotel facilities are most important to you when choosing accommodation?\nSwimming pool\nFitness center\nRestaurants and bars\nMassage and spa\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nCP\nDo you like the content of this article?\n0\n2",

This marks a continuation of the mission to inspire real action through collaboration across all sectors, as 'sustainability is a shared responsibility for everyone.'\nSpeaking at the \u2018SX Launching Forward: SX 2025' session at SX Grand Plenary Hall, G Floor, the Queen Sirikit National Convention Center (QSNCC), Mr Thapana emphasised the goal of expanding partnerships with networks in all sectors. He also outlined plans to intensify activities across the five core zones\u2014SEP Inspiration, Better Me, Better Community, Better Living, and Better World\u2014over the 10-day event. The aim is to motivate everyone to take meaningful action for a sustainable future and invite them to become 'SX Shapers,' the agents of this change.\nRELATED\nlife\nPhoto exhibit celebrates a special friendship\nthailand\nThe World Bank Promotes ESG Sustainability at SX Sustainability Expo 2024\nThe Sustainability Expo (SX) , is the largest sustainability event in ASEAN, launched in 2020 by the combined efforts of five major business organisations within the Thailand Supply Chain Network (TSCN) including Frasers Property (Thailand) Public Company Limited, PTT Public Company Limited, SCG, Thai Beverage Public Company Limited, and Thai Union Group Public Company Limited, SX will be held annually until 2030, aligning with the United Nations\u2019 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the \u2018Decade of Action\u2019 to meet 17 global goals across five areas: People, Prosperity, Planet, Peace, and Partnership.\nBuilding a Sustainable Future Starts with Individual Action and Collective Collaboration\n\u201cSustainability often makes us think of global concerns, but it ultimately starts with individuals. Achieving Net Zero Carbon Emissions requires collective effort from all\u2014countries, organisations, public and private sectors, and consumers alike. The real question is, how can we collaborate to build a truly sustainable world? As we consume the Earth\u2019s natural resources, it\u2019s our duty to restore its richness for future generations,\u201d Mr Thapana explained.\nThe SX continues to embody the concept of 'Sufficiency for Sustainability,' promoting awareness of balance and moderation by following the guiding principles of H.M. King Maha Vajiralongkorn and the philosophy of the Sufficiency Economy introduced by His Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej The Great.\n\u201cIn today\u2019s business landscape, extremism is common. Consumers want the best products at the lowest prices, and we live in a consumer-driven world. The challenge is finding a way to co-exist while creating a sustainable future,\u201d he reflected.\nMr Thapana also affirmed that the event will continue through 2030, in alignment with the UN\u2019s Decade of Action, with the hope that the youth will drive the future of sustainability. SX represents a shared vision for a brighter future, and in 2025, the event will return with more dynamic activities and deeper engagement.\n\"I would like to thank all the representatives and participants for coming together today. Let\u2019s take this opportunity to learn and be part of building a sustainable future together. See you at SX 2025 at the Queen Sirikit National Convention Center,\" Mr Thapana concluded.\nMs Tongjai Thanachanan, Director of SX 2024\nMs Tongjai Thanachanan, Director of SX 2024, also reflected on this year\u2019s achievements, noting the expansion to a 10-day event covering 70,000 square metres. Now in its fifth year, SX 2024 surpassed expectations with over 700,000 attendees, including 227,452 youths aged 18-35, surpassing the original target of 500,000 participants. The SX 2024 application also recorded over 200,000 downloads.\nBeyond impressive attendance figures, SX 2024 featured more than 700 speakers and contributors who shared their expertise on sustainability, representing over 270 organisations. The event maintained its B2C2B (Business-to-Consumer-to-Business) model, encouraging consumers to adopt more sustainable habits.\nSX 2024 Drives 40 Million THB in Revenue and Strengthens Global Collaboration for Sustainability\nThroughout the 10-day expo, the SX Marketplace and SX Food Festival generated over 40 million THB in revenue for local communities and entrepreneurs. This included nearly 24 million THB from the Food Festival and over 17 million THB from the SX Marketplace, where booth space was provided free of charge.\nIn response to severe flooding in Northern Thailand, two benefit concerts were held on September 28 and October 5, raising 4.8 million THB for flood relief efforts. Media partnerships were vital in amplifying the event\u2019s impact, with over 3 million views on social media, 8 million views through online media partners, and 9.2 million views on television.\nMs Tongjai also highlighted SX\u2019s five-year track record of success saying that \u201cOver the past five years, more than 1.2 million people have engaged with sustainability themes through SX, generating over 100 million THB for local communities. The SX Market Place alone raised 18 million THB from 281 vendors. In the SX REPARTMENTSTORE, more than 4,000 donated items were sold, raising 80,000 THB. We also collected 7,146 kilogrammes of recyclable materials, including PET bottles, glass bottles, aluminum cans, and cardboard boxes, along with 5,600 kilogrammes of food waste, which helped reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 26 tonnes of CO2 equivalent.\u201d\nMs Tongjai added that \u201cIn addition to these milestones, we have strengthened frameworks for collaboration both locally and internationally. This year, over 20 international organisations participated in exhibitions. We have seen clearer, more practical examples of B2C2B (Business-to-Consumer-to-Business) collaboration, such as the partner practice declarations from the Thailand Supply Chain Network (TSCN) and the presentation of the SX TSCN Sustainability Award to 48 partners working on sustainability initiatives with TSCN co-founders. These projects produced measurable outcomes in both social and environmental dimensions. Our network partners, SCG and the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment, also returned to co-host major events like the ESG Symposium 2024 and the Thailand Climate Action Conference (TCAC) 2024, further establishing SX as a central platform for sustainability and a key learning space for organisations and educational institutions alike.\u201d\nShe also attributed the event\u2019s success to strong collaborations between the public and private sectors, as well as the support of all participants.\n\u201cThis success is a proud milestone in driving Thailand\u2019s economy forward, particularly in terms of sustainability.

Its Hinghoi Project, now in its eighth year, has been presented with the AREA Awards 2024 (Asia Responsible Enterprise Awards) \u2013 the third consecutive year the project has been awarded the accolade for Social Empowerment by Enterprise Asia, a leading non-government organisation that promotes responsible enterprises in Asia.&nbsp;&nbsp;\nThis achievement is a testament to the company's commitment to leveraging its people's capabilities for social and community development. It aligns with CKPower's CSR Strategy Framework 2022\u20132026, which includes success indicators for the Hinghoi Project. The framework aims to continuously increase community access to renewable energy, in line with the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals. &nbsp;&nbsp;\nMr Thanawat Trivisvavet, Managing Director of CKPower Public Company Limited\n,\nsaid, \u201cWe are committed to leveraging our clean energy engineering capabilities to support local communities and society. This effort aligns with our CSR Strategy Framework 2022\u20132026 and contributes to the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We have consistently improved and cared for the local communities around our power plants. Our Hinghoi Project, now in its eighth year, has made a positive impact on society in multiple ways. It has increased community access to renewable energy by up to 40,330 watts. Additionally, it has enhanced knowledge of renewable energy for 4,030 leadership teachers and youths. The project has also educated 1,272 people about natural resources and environmental protection. Through these efforts, we are making steady progress in our plan to sustainably improve society's quality of life.\u201d&nbsp;\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe Hinghoi Project by CKPower began in 2016. It was a collaboration of CKPower\u2019s employees, local communities and networks to leverage the know-how and expertise in power production engineering of the company\u2019s personnel to develop society and local communities, especially in solving power shortages. The Hinghoi Project, in its eighth year, recently supported the development of the Ban Mae Mu Nai Border Patrol Police Learning Centre under CKPower\u2019s patronage, where the company led its engineers and staff to design and construct a library in the form of an energy-saving building to reduce power consumption while using locally sourced materials in harmony with the local landscape for ease of future maintenance. There are plans for CKPower\u2019s employees to improve the landscape and decorate the library with a renewable energy theme, while encouraging children and youth to learn and understand renewable energy as well as to lead sustainable lives.&nbsp;\nCKPower's commitment through the Hinghoi Project illustrates the company\u2019s social empowerment capabilities in the four aspects evaluated by Enterprise Asia: 1) the project has leveraged the principal engineering capabilities of the organisation to develop society and local communities with far-reaching positive impact within the company\u2019s CSR Strategy Framework (Competency, Co-Creation, Cooperation, Connection); 2) the project has produced generations of leadership teachers and clean energy students to ensure sustainable renewable energy development; 3) the project has clear goals and measurable results and has consistently been executed to achieve these goals; 4) the project exemplifies sustainable development by setting up a renewable energy fund, ensuring each community has the resources to maintain company-provided equipment and to consistently follow up on what has been done. As a result, CKPower has been awarded the AREA Awards 2024 for Social Empowerment for the third consecutive year. This recognition underscores the company's ongoing commitment to social responsibility and community development.&nbsp;\nMr Thanawat added: \u201cWinning the AREA Award 2024 is a success and a testament to CKPower\u2019s intention to take care of society and local communities. We consistently follow up on the Hinghoi Project, now in its eighth year, as well as other initiatives under the Hinghoi Project\u2019s mission, such as the Empowering Kids for a Sustainable World project. This model project fulfils the need for renewable energy through solar panel installations and a renewable energy fund for schools and communities around our power plants. The initiative helps save money on electricity bills for Pakthongchai Chunhawan Wittayakarn School near the Bangkhenchai Solar Power Plant in Nakhon Ratchasima, and Udomseel Witthaya School near the Bangpa-in Cogeneration Power Plant in Ayutthaya. It also makes children and youth leaders more knowledgeable with a better understanding of renewable energy as part of our effort to pass on this knowledge to the communities around the schools, helping to build on and fulfil the goals of the Hinghoi Project in providing widespread access to renewable energy for society and local communities. Under this initiative, CKPower\u2019s volunteers have worked together to design teaching methods for over 200 renewable energy youths at the two local schools so they can pass on knowledge about renewable energy, and the protection and rehabilitation of natural resources and the environment.\u201d&nbsp;\nThe Hinghoi Project, through which CKPower has leveraged its power production engineering expertise to benefit society. The recent activity was held at the Baan Mae Mu Nai Border Patrol Police Learning Centre under CKPower\u2019s patronage in Chiang Mai, aiming to educate children and youth about renewable energy and support their sustainable quality of life.\nFor the next step, CKPower will continue the Hinghoi Project to achieve its CSR Strategy Framework goals by 2026. This will involve creating shared social value in collaboration with all power plants in Thailand and the Lao PDR to ensure sustainable project development. The initiative will also promote access to renewable energy to improve quality of life, establish renewable energy funds to support sustainable livelihoods, and expand the network of renewable energy leadership teachers and youth for a far-reaching positive impact.&nbsp;&nbsp;\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhich app or platform do you usually use to book accommodations?\nBooking.com\nAgoda\nAirbnb\nTrip.com\nTraveloka\nExpedia\nSkyscanner\nDirectly with the accommodation\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nDo you like the content of this article?\n1\n1\nCOMMENT",

Our vision aims to reorient economic and social frameworks to foster low-carbon, climate-resilient growth that enhances prosperity and inclusion.\nThe need for a just transition, one that puts people at the centre of the shift to net zero, cannot be overstated. Asia and the Pacific account for over half of the world's annual greenhouse gas emissions, driven by its dependence on fossil fuels. At the same time, more than 200 million people in the region are impoverished, with many lacking access to basic electricity and relying on traditional biomass for cooking and heating. Women are particularly affected and often face disproportionate impacts.\nAs Asia and the Pacific's climate bank, ADB prioritises an inclusive approach to ensure the costs and benefits of the transition to net zero are fairly distributed. Achieving net zero requires us to restructure our economies and change the way we live and work. It is paramount that in this process, the burdens of change are not imposed on the most vulnerable and that the benefits of a low-carbon economy are both maximised and shared equitably. Ensuring that all segments of society, including women, share in these benefits is critical to the success of our just transition efforts.\nADVERTISEMENT\nTo create opportunities for inclusive and sustainable growth, ADB works with partners to implement robust policy frameworks, enhance institutional capacities and engage stakeholders through participatory processes. These just transition efforts align with global commitments such as the Paris Agreement, and at the country level, we support our developing members in crafting policies and programs that respond to their unique climate challenges and development needs.\nRELATED\nthailand\nBIG and Delta Pioneer the First Low-Carbon Nitrogen  in Thailand's Electronics Industry\nlife\nTurning trash to cash\nAt COP27, ADB launched a Just Transition Support Platform to help drive a just transition within our developing member countries. This platform focuses on supporting countries to incorporate just transition into their institutional and policy frameworks and identify innovative financing approaches that attract public and private capital for a just transition. The platform also supports the mainstreaming of just transition in ADB's operations.\nMoreover, at COP28, ADB launched an inclusive process to design a Just Transition Finance Facility that will provide targeted finance to address the socio-economic challenges of the transition to net zero. It will help countries realise the economic and social benefits of the transition and ensure these benefits are inclusive and widespread, ultimately supporting a robust and equitable shift to low-carbon and resilient economies.\nJust transition is also a core part of ADB's Energy Transition Mechanism (ETM). Developed in partnership with ADB countries, ETM is a scalable initiative that has the potential to be one of the largest carbon-reduction schemes in the world. Under it, public and private investments finance country-specific ETM funds. These funds are designed to retire or repurpose coal power assets on an earlier schedule compared with a business-as-usual timeline.\nJust transition principles are a cornerstone of ETM's implementation, helping us to ensure that potential negative socio-economic impacts are minimised through policies and programmes. For example, retraining and reskilling programmes provide new opportunities for women and vulnerable workers in emerging industries.\nThe importance of managing the social impacts associated with the transition to net zero can be seen in ADB's work on the Cirebon 1 coal-fired power station in Indonesia. This plant serves as an ETM pilot, for which ADB completed a preliminary just transition assessment earlier this year -- the first of its kind for ADB and the region. The assessment utilised a comprehensive methodology to identify impacts along the coal value chain and within the community and surrounding areas. It also established a process to assess and develop a plan to manage impacts at the appropriate project stages.\nJust transition offers a compelling vision for green and inclusive development across Asia and the Pacific. Its promise lies not only in avoiding the worst impacts of climate change but in creating a more equitable social order that values well-being and gender equality, provides decent work, and ensures sustainable economic growth.\nWe must encourage optimism and concerted effort from all sectors of society to embrace the principles of justice and inclusivity that will be needed for a low-carbon, climate-resilient future. This journey faces challenges but is also filled with opportunities for transformative change that can forge a healthier, more equitable and prosperous world. The path we chart now will determine the climate legacy we leave for future generations.\nMasatsugu Asakawa is President of the Asian Development Bank.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat is your budget range for purchasing a house in Thailand?\nUnder 3 million THB\n3 million - 5 million THB\n5 million - 8 million THB\n8 million - 12 million THB\nOver 12 million THB\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nGas emissions\nClimate change\nDo you like the content of this article?\n2\n10\nCOMMENT\n(2)",

Many policymakers and scholars agree that the next chairmanship is perfectly timed for Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, one of the region's most experienced leaders.\nTo showcase Malaysia, the chair revealed its logo and theme of \"Inclusivity and Sustainability\". The colourful logo depicts the country's national flower, the bunga raya. The inward-curving design symbolises the strength of Asean centrality and unity.\nMalaysia faces numerous formidable challenges. The chair must fine-tune the right approach to increasing intra-Asean cooperation in all pillars and strengthening relations with dialogue partners, especially China and the US. It will also be a landmark year as Malaysia launches the new Asean Community Vision 2045, which will chart the Asean strategic pathway in the next twenty years.\nADVERTISEMENT\nFurthermore, Asean is expected to welcome Timor-Leste as its 11th member. The chair will also broaden the engagement between Asean and other developing economies in the Global South, including the Gulf Cooperation Council and Brics.\nRELATED\nopinion\nUniting against cyber-scam gangs\nthailand\nPheu Thai's Prayuth, crusader against military coups\nAt the Brics summit in Kazan, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, and Indonesia were made Brics partners.\nAt the 46th Asean Summit scheduled for May 5-7, 2025, the Asean leaders will adopt the 1,830-word Asean Community Vision 2045. This ambitious document addresses a wide range of issues and scenarios.\nThe vision was based on input from the bloc's top bureaucrats and thinkers who understand Asean. These experts have also outlined strategic plans across the three pillars, connectivity, and improvement of the Asean Secretariat to ensure its future success. The Vision 2045 document is the product of extensive consultation involving both top-down and bottom-up processes, including input from civil society and the private sector.\nThe Asean Community Vision 2045 is a forward-looking blueprint that seeks to position Asean as a dynamic, resilient, innovative and people-centric regional organisation. Future-ready Asean will be nimble and agile. It emphasises sustainability, economic integration, human capital development, and technological innovation as future pillars.\nMost importantly, the vision recognises the changing global order, especially the shift towards multipolarity.\nIn recent months, Mr Anwar has not held back when speaking about key regional and global issues, including the Myanmar quagmire, the South China Sea dispute, the current Middle East crisis, and the ongoing US-China rivalry. His frank comments on these issues have been unusual among his Asean colleagues.\nWell before the recent chairmanship handover from Laos to Malaysia, Mr Anwar made it clear that Asean, under his leadership, would be an active player, aiming to raise the bloc's profile and relevance on the global stage.\nMr Anwar's outspoken stance on the Middle East crisis has particularly gained attention. Following the escalation of violence in Gaza, Mr Anwar condemned the large-scale civilian casualties and emphasised the need for immediate humanitarian assistance. He has called for a ceasefire and urged the US to take a more balanced approach to the conflict.\nReaffirming Asean's position on the Palestinian problem, he advocated a two-state solution that respects the rights of both Israelis and Palestinians. Mr Anwar's comments on the Middle East crisis reflect his broader foreign policy approach, which emphasises moral clarity and the pursuit of peace. He has also urged Asean members to stay united despite growing global tensions. Asean must be a stabilising force in the region.\nAs Asean chair, Mr Anwar is expected to find innovative diplomatic approaches to balance the two competing superpowers -- the US and China. The former is the region's main security guarantor, and the latter is its most important economic partner. He frequently stressed the importance of the bloc's strategic autonomy and that its members must not be drawn into the superpowers' polarisation.\n\"Anwar is an old hand. He knows the geopolitical contours of the day,\" commented Phar Kim Beng, a Malaysian scholar on international affairs.\nMalaysia is also eager to expand Asean and admit Timor-Leste. The debate is no longer about whether the world's youngest democracy is ready to join Asean but whether it should be left behind -- waiting for the full implementation of the Asean-proposed roadmap. In Vientiane, some Asean leaders sympathised with Dilli, arguing that if strict conditions remain, the country might take several years to join the Asean family.\nAs a result, there were talks about \"discounts\" on the 220 economic agreements Timor-Leste must accede to. Before joining the World Trade Organization (WTO) at the end of August, Timor-Leste submitted a note to the Asean Secretariat showing its readiness to meet 66 key agreements after the admission. The remaining agreements will be implemented within six to eight years. A compromise number of agreements must be agreed upon.\nWhen Malaysia holds its first foreign ministerial retreat in January 2025 in Langkawi to discuss and set forth the Asean agenda, they must indicate if Timor-Leste will become a full member by that year. As one seasoned Asean diplomat put it, its membership is at a \"now or never\" crossroads.\nFor the past decade, the focus has been zeroed in on Timor-Leste's preparedness to participate in Asean's three pillars: political/security, economic, and socio/cultural. Various Asean members and experts have visited the country in the past two years, preparing the roadmap for its membership.\nThe Asean leaders face a Catch-22 situation. Joining Asean in the post-pandemic era, Timor-Leste could complicate the bloc's economic integration and other decision-making processes. Dili also lacks the human resources necessary to participate in Asean's extensive meetings, which are almost on par with the United Nations in terms of frequency.\nOn the other hand, leaving Timor-Leste behind the Asean family could open the door for external powers to exert influence over the country, especially given its rich energy resources and substantial oil reserves. Truth be told, the time has come for Asean leaders to make a political decision on whether to welcome Timor-Leste into the group.\nDuring the chairmanship handover ceremony on Oct 9, Mr Anwar announced that Malaysia will host the Asean-Gulf Cooperation Council plus China Summit. This summit is one of the flagship events under his leadership. It will certainly have significant global impacts due to the bloc's role in bridging the Gulf States and China.\nLast week in Kazan, Malaysia became one of 12 Brics partners, which included three other Asean members -- Thailand, Vietnam, and Indonesia. As such, under the Malaysian chair, Asean's ability to promote communication, dialogue and cooperation with emerging economies, big and small, points to its ability to serve as a bridge between key global players, including G20, further ramping up Asean relevance.\nTo do that, the East Asia Summit (EAS), which will celebrate its 20th anniversary next year, needs fresh ideas to bolster its role as the world's top strategic forum. The latest EAS meeting showed cracks among its members, especially the eight dialogue partners, which could threaten Asean unity. If this trend continues, the future of EAS could be in jeopardy. It can weaken this strategic platform. The Jakarta-based EAS envoys accredited to Asean should have more dialogue in shepherding the EAS summit and deliverables.\nMr Anwar's experience and direct approach, especially on contentious global issues, suggest that Asean, under Malaysia's chairmanship, could see more assertive diplomacy and a greater focus on ensuring the bloc's long-term relevance. One caveat is in order, granted all favourite circumstances -- the chair must still be modest.\nKavi Chongkittavorn\nA veteran journalist on regional affairs\nKavi Chongkittavorn is a veteran journalist on regional affairs\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat is your budget range for renting a condominium?\nUnder 10,000 THB/month\n10,000 - 20,000 THB/month\n20,000 - 40,000 THB/month\n40,000 - 60,000 THB/month\nOver 60,000 THB/month\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nOpinion\nAsean\nMalaysia\nEast Asia Summit\nEAS\nAsean Community Vision 2025\nPrime Minister\nAnwar Ibrahim\n\u0e2d\u0e32\u0e40\u0e0b\u0e35\u0e22\u0e19\n\u0e21\u0e32\u0e40\u0e25\u0e40\u0e0b\u0e35\u0e22\n\u0e01\u0e32\u0e23\u0e1b\u0e23\u0e30\u0e0a\u0e38\u0e21\u0e2a\u0e38\u0e14\u0e22\u0e2d\u0e14\u0e40\u0e2d\u0e40\u0e0a\u0e35\u0e22\u0e15\u0e30\u0e27\u0e31\u0e19\u0e2d\u0e2d\u0e01\n\u0e27\u0e34\u0e2a\u0e31\u0e22\u0e17\u0e31\u0e28\u0e19\u0e4c\u0e1b\u0e23\u0e30\u0e0a\u0e32\u0e04\u0e21\u0e2d\u0e32\u0e40\u0e0b\u0e35\u0e22\u0e19 2025\n\u0e19\u0e32\u0e22\u0e01\u0e23\u0e31\u0e10\u0e21\u0e19\u0e15\u0e23\u0e35\nDo you like the content of this article?\n9\n15\nCOMMENT\n(2)",

The US central bank cut interest rates by 50 basis points to a range of 4.75% to 5.00%, amid signs of continued economic strength. Economic data for September showed remarkable resilience, with non-farm payroll growth exceeding expectations, while unemployment dropped to 4.1%. Inflation has reached a three-year low at 2.4%.\nNevertheless, some caution is in order. The Fed's latest Beige Book report paints a picture of an economy showing signs of a \"soft landing\", with most activities remaining stable amid modest increases in employment and prices, coupled with slowing wage growth.\nADVERTISEMENT\nBut the report also highlights a significant trend of consumers \"trading down\" to cheaper alternatives across multiple regions. This shift in purchasing behaviour reflects growing price sensitivity among American shoppers, who are increasingly reluctant to pay full price for non-essential items.\nDifferent metropolitan areas are also experiencing varied economic conditions. In New York, the restaurant businesses shows signs of decline while Broadway theatres have seen a recovery. In Philadelphia, credit demand is slowing as borrowers anticipate further rate cuts. In Chicago and San Francisco, consumers are actively seeking discounts and lower-priced alternatives. In Dallas, requests for assistance are increasing from elderly residents due to inflation pressures, with some forced to return to work.\nRELATED\nworld\nS.Korea's Yoon faces impeachment over short-lived martial law declaration\nbusiness\nStocks tipped to surge in US, Asia in 2025\nThe report indicates a notable slowdown in credit applications, as prospective borrowers await lower interest rates. This trend suggests pressure for faster rate cuts by the Fed.\nHowever, we caution that if former president Donald Trump wins the upcoming election and imposes his proposed tariff increases on imports, it could trigger renewed inflation pressures. This scenario might constrain the Fed's ability to cut rates as expected.\nDELICATE BALANCE\nThe overall report suggests a delicate economic balance, with consumers showing increased caution in spending and investment decisions. This cautious behaviour may influence the Fed to consider continued easing in the future, though political and inflation risks remain significant factors in the decision-making process.\nThe current economic indicators align with our soft-landing scenario. But we must remain vigilant about potential inflation risks and political uncertainties that could affect the monetary policy trajectory.\nSecond, China has unleashed a comprehensive stimulus package. An extensive series of monetary and fiscal measures have been announced to combat the economic slowdown. The monetary initiatives include reductions in seven-day reverse repo rates, medium-term lending facility rates, and long-term interest rates, alongside cuts to the reserve requirement ratio for commercial banks.\nA notable 800-billion-yuan stock market stabilisation fund has also been established, complemented by property sector stimulus measures.\nThe fiscal policy response has been equally robust, featuring accelerated government investment, special infrastructure bonds and support for local government financing. These measures come as China's GDP growth reached 4.6% year-on-year, bringing the nine-month figure to 4.8%, at the lower end of annual targets.\nWhile September data showed improvements in retail sales, electrical appliance and automotive sales, significant challenges persist. These include weakening exports, deflationary pressures and an unstable real estate market, in which new home prices have declined for 16 consecutive months.\nPOTENTIAL RISKS\nWhile Beijing's recent stimulus measures demonstrate the government's commitment to economic recovery, we highlight several significant concerns about their effectiveness and potential risks. Our first concern is local governments, which serve as crucial policy implementation vehicles but are grappling with overwhelming debt burdens. This financial strain could significantly hamper their ability to execute new initiatives effectively.\nOur second concern is the property sector, with many cities still facing substantial oversupply issues that complicate recovery efforts. Lastly, commercial banks may face increased risks as they become primary instruments for economic support measures.\nHowever, September's improved data, particularly the consumption and production metrics, could indicate early signs of recovery. These may partly reflect the impact of previous stimulus measures. Hence, we need to closely monitor China's economic trajectory to evaluate whether the stimulus measures will yield positive results.\nThird, Thailand has joined the easing trend. The Bank of Thailand has reduced its policy rate from 2.50% to 2.25%, responding to tight financial conditions and concerns over credit contraction. August economic indicators showed a broad slowdown, affecting tourism, industrial production and private investment, though agricultural exports showed some improvement.\nSeptember's inflation rate came in below expectations at 0.6%, while the Producer Price Index (PPI) contracted. The INVX Financial Condition Index has reached its tightest level in 16 years, influenced by a strong baht and record-high lending rates.\nAs for investment implications, we recommend four key investment strategies:\nCompanies with strong fundamentals and consistent profit growth.

But they are as under-resourced and poorly supported by national governments as at any time in their history. Their predicament is perhaps the clearest sign that economic and financial multilateralism is fragmenting along with the global economy. Worse, this fragmentation comes at a time of rising international tensions, financial fragility, sputtering growth, rising poverty, and mounting reconstruction bills in Gaza, Lebanon, Ukraine, and elsewhere.\nBoth institutions are led by individuals who grasp the urgent need for reform to meet today's challenges. Yet they lack sufficient support from their political masters: the largest share-holding countries whose votes are crucial for reform. To overcome the longstanding international coordination problems that have undermined reform efforts, we need a revamped G20 to take the lead. With its current chair, Brazil, it is well-placed to make significant progress.\nFinancial firepower is, of course, only one measure of the effectiveness of our multinational institutions, but it is an important one given the world we live in. The resources available to the IMF represent less than 1% (specifically 0.85%) of the global economy. Yet, as the lender of last resort and a financial safety net for the world, it is expected to deal with the problems of 191 member countries, as well as joining the global response to \"non-traditional\" and \"new\" issues such as climate change, gender disparities, and inequality.\nADVERTISEMENT\nSuch underfunding contradicts the intentions of the IMF's founders, led by the United Kingdom and the United States. At its creation, the Fund could draw on resources equal to roughly 3% of global GDP to help address a mere 44 countries' monetary and balance-of-payments problems. Since then, IMF membership has grown fourfold, yet its resources have declined by more than two-thirds relative to GDP. This erosion is reflected in the Fund's waning global heft and loss of capacity to solve tricky country cases.\nRELATED\nbusiness\nBitcoin passes $100,000 milestone\nbusiness\nHong Kong airport boosts efforts to lure foreign airlines as it waits on Cathay\nConsider the following examples. Four decades ago, in the seminal restructuring of Mexico's debt, the IMF promised one-third of what Mexico needed, on the expectation that commercial creditors would contribute the remainder. That financial capability then allowed it to press the private sector to accept a solution that traded off some of the creditors' contractual claims on Mexico for an improved outlook for financial viability.\nBy contrast, after Zambia defaulted in 2020, the IMF provided it with less than 10% of its financing needs. Despite such support, Zambia has struggled through four years of negotiations with creditors to finalise restructuring agreements. While part of the challenge reflects the changing composition of both private and public creditors, much of it also stems from the diminished effectiveness of the Fund's \"carrot and stick\" approach.\nA Dangerous World\nThis is no small challenge for an institution that also plays critical surveillance and technical assistance roles, serving as the anchor of the international financial safety net. There are reasons to worry that the kind of shocks we have been experiencing (from Covid-19 to the Ukraine and Gaza wars) will become even more frequent and violent in the years ahead, not least because of the climate challenge. The disturbing inadequacy of today's safety nets, especially for the most vulnerable countries and segments of society, is proving to be an additional source of fragility and instability.\nDespite these rising challenges, the IMF's resources remain below historical levels, and the most recent quota review failed to produce a net increase in its lending capacity. In fact, between March 2020 and March 2023, the IMF committed US$191 billion (and disbursed less than $75 billion) of its trillion-dollar resource base.\nThe Fund's surveillance role also faces major challenges. Framed as a crisis-prevention tool for both individual countries and the overall system, IMF surveillance has, over decades, failed to predict and correctly frame economic shocks. Admittedly, national policymakers have failed, too. Some failures are understandable, as in the case of the pandemic. But others, including the supply-chain disruptions and subsequent surge in inflation, could have been foreseen and subjected to better analysis. Such slippages support the case for new investments in a more effective system of surveillance.\nThe World Bank is even less adequately resourced for the additional climate responsibilities it has been given. In a report commissioned by the Indian G20 presidency last year, co-chairs Lawrence H Summers and N K Singh argued that multilateral development banks (MDBs) need to triple their lending by 2030 when it should be around $400 billion annually. Yet allocations to lower- and middle-income countries in 2023 were equivalent to just 0.07% of global GDP. The $73 billion earmarked for the World Bank in the 2023 fiscal year represented the smallest commitment to development in the institution's existence.\nWhat ails the IMF and the World Bank is not limited to these two institutions. We are witnessing a broader and increasingly worrisome breakdown in multilateralism -- and this at a time when the world's common problems can be solved only through coordination and common action.\nToday's MDBs, which include the regional development banks, provide loans equivalent to just 0.5% of developing countries' gross national income, down from a peak of 0.7% in the 1990s. Equally, the World Trade Organization struggles with an overly legalistic judge-based rulebook that was imposed on it at the height of neoliberalism in the 1990s. Its effectiveness has always hinged on negotiation, conciliation, and arbitration, but these approaches have taken a back seat to geopolitical rivalries and unilateralism in recent decades.\nThen there is the World Health Organization. Though the WHO's current replenishment target is $11 billion, only $4 billion has been guaranteed, and its annual budget is no larger than that of medium-size US hospitals. By denying the WHO the resources it needs while at the same time asking it to cover new health concerns, including well-being as a whole, we are depriving ourselves of the benefits of a global institution that finds it difficult to finance even its most basic tasks.\nFinally, the creation of the G20 was a welcome response to the realisation that the G7 no longer represented the face of global economic influence and power. By bringing together countries that account for around 80% of world GDP, the G20 had the best chance of helping us prevent or manage systemic crises like the one in 2008-10.\nYet despite its obvious potential, the G20 has operated without a structure to ensure continuity and effectiveness. And because its members include Russia and China, the US still prefers to work through the G7, which Jake Sullivan, the current national security adviser, sees as \"the steering committee of the free world\", even though G7 countries now represent only 43% of world GDP.\nA sweeping approach to reforming the world's multilateral institutions -- often presented under the banner of \"Bretton Woods 2.0\" -- is unlikely to get off the ground. But incremental progress is possible. Initiative by initiative, it could develop into a critical mass that would be welfare-enhancing for many, if not most, countries and people.\nThe WTO, for example, should focus on leveraging the undeniable skills of its current director-general, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, to solve trade disputes through conciliation, arbitration, and negotiation. That would mark a move away from its overly legalistic and now broken, judge-based appeal system.\nSimilarly, the IMF, led by an equally charismatic managing director, can enhance its contributions to crisis prevention and resolution by leaning into its role as a global early-warning system. That also means responding to any future crisis with more financial firepower and by mobilising lending capacity to enhance resilience against economic shocks, to negotiate a much-improved sovereign-debt restructuring mechanism, and thus to create a more comprehensive global financial safety net with limited conditionality in situations of large exogenous shocks.\nWhile high-income countries have borrowing capacity and reserves to weather most shocks, some emerging markets do not, and low-income countries are even more exposed, given their limited reserves and high vulnerability to losing access to financial markets. Faced with the threat of sovereign defaults and a lost decade of development, too many indebted countries have sought alternative ways to avoid what they view as overly harsh conditions imposed by multilateral lenders. But to avoid defaulting, many governments have reallocated their health and education spending. Tragically, 3.3 billion people now live in countries that spend more on interest payments than on these two basic services.\nThe Bretton Woods institutions also need to support developing countries' urgent climate mitigation and adaptation needs. Failure to do so would not only jeopardise tens of millions of people's well-being; it also would have negative cross-border spillovers, including through migration pressures. Both organizations have taken some steps to meet developing countries' (excluding China) need for $1 trillion of annual external funding by 2030. For example, the World Bank has arranged for \"catastrophe bonds\" to assist countries devastated by the increasing number of natural disasters, and the IMF has introduced a Resilience and Sustainability Trust as a lending window that is resourced through voluntary reallocations of Special Drawing Rights (SDRs, the IMF's reserve asset). But these interventions are not enough.\nTo be sure, the World Bank now directs 41% of its lending to climate-related projects, and its new mission statement refers to \"a liveable planet\". But without a significant increase in its overall resources, this new focus on climate change could come at the expense of investments in human capital and its traditional development work, unless wealthy countries put up more money. There are no shortcuts.\nThe key to revitalising the world's multilateral institutions is to reform their governance to reflect the enormous shifts in the configuration of the global economy over the past few decades. The shareholding structure of the IMF and the World Bank and the outmoded process of allocating top jobs according to nationality are no longer in step with current realities.\nEven today, 59.1% of voting shares in the IMF are held by countries representing just 13.7% of the world's population. India and China are the world's two most systemically important and influential emerging economies, yet their combined share is only 9%. Without a change here, an institution that is supposed to address the world's biggest economic and financial problems will face growing doubts about its legitimacy, fairness, and effectiveness by most of the Global South.\nMore needs to be done, and quickly, to deal with excessive debt and debt-service costs in the 79 low- and middle-income countries that are deemed to be in debt distress or at high risk of it. The situation demands a plan for comprehensive, sustainable, and incentive-aligned debt relief, including through re-profiling existing loans, debt swaps, and credit guarantees.\nFirst, IMF member states should strengthen the Fund's capacity to provide otherwise well-managed debt-distressed countries regular annual allocations of its \"in-house\" financial instrument.\nAlthough $650 billion in SDRs were allocated in 2021, only $21 billion went to the lowest-income countries that were most in need of help. The rules for SDR allocations need to be fundamentally revised and redistribution made more automatic if this channel is to be used more effectively to counter future systemic shocks.\nSecond, making the Common Framework for Debt Treatments work better will require closer cooperation with China's government and private creditors. Both carrots and sticks need to be revamped. The alternative of protracted negotiations, side deals, and incomplete restructuring often produces only limited benefits, and it is open to abuse. In addition to delaying comprehensive solutions, such temporary fixes can complicate the next round of restructurings.\nThird, the IMF needs to address the perceived lack of fairness in the conditions that it requires poorer countries to meet when seeking relief. Fortunately, the managing director is clearly aware of the need to lower the punitive interest rates charged to middle-income countries. In 2020, ten countries faced surcharges to the IMF, yet by 2023, that figure had more than doubled, reaching 22, owing to the impact of the pandemic, the conflict in Ukraine, and rising interest rates.\nOn top of that, the IMF's basic lending rate soared from below 1% to nearly 5%, pushing the overall rate for countries incurring surcharges as high as 7.8%. The IMF's recently launched review of its surcharge policy now provides a platform for changes that would not undermine its preferred creditor status.\nFinally, as a preventive measure, governments need to come together to establish an equitable global financial safety net. As Masood Ahmed, president emeritus of the Center for Global Development, has argued, there should be \"a separate identifiable IMF facility that would be triggered by a defined systemic shock and provide resources to all emerging markets and low-income countries in good standing\" without the penalties of excessively priced surcharges.\nAs for the World Bank, its dynamic president, Ajay Banga, has started his term with a determination to reform and is on the right track in launching a Liveable Planet Fund focused on human capital and environmental stewardship. But this initiative needs more resources, and Banga has justifiably called for the largest-ever replenishment of the International Development Association, which provides concessional loans and grants to the poorest countries.\nGiven the rising number of global poor -- now at 700 million -- we cannot settle for less. The Summers/Singh G20 report not only calls on MDBs to provide an additional $260 billion per year but also urges expanded use of innovative financial tools such as guarantees, risk-mitigation instruments, and hybrid capital.\nGiven that the G7 cannot, in fact, be the permanent steering committee for a world economy in which its members have a minority share, the G20 should become what it was intended to be: the premier forum for global economic cooperation, including when it comes to promoting the reform of the multilateral institutions.\nBut that will require a more representative system to offer smaller countries a role in a constituency-based framework, as well as a professional secretariat to ensure continuity from year to year.\nThe Brazilian G20 presidency has already laid out three key priorities for the November meeting: fighting hunger, poverty, and inequality; promoting sustainable development; and pursuing global governance reform. All three goals could pave the way for a new decade of improved cooperation, with the third in particular offering a welcome opportunity to overcome the inter-country coordination problems that have frustrated the necessary changes at the IMF and World Bank. We know what needs to happen and why. If well managed, this G20 could provide the sought-after \"how\".\nMassive revisions to the international system come about only after a complete breakdown of the current order. Hence, the post-1918 Versailles system arose after five dynastic empires collapsed and shattered into dozens of new nation-states; the post-1945 architecture followed the defeat of Germany, Italy, and Japan; and what US President George H W Bush called a liberal \"new world order\" had to wait until the collapse of the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact.\nThe urgent challenge today is to achieve the transition to a fifth world order without weathering a damaging breakdown. Such an order must account for the global realignment of economic and political power, especially the ambitions of the Global South. And it must be not only stable and fair, but also sustainable and open to effective collective action.\nTwo paths are open to us. One leads towards ever more global fragmentation and deepening crises, while the other offers a chance to pursue both individual and shared prosperity through joint solutions to common problems.

(File photo: Reuters)\nSINGAPORE - For decades, China has sought to maintain influence among armed ethnic groups in Myanmar in lawless border areas while also providing support to military leaders in charge of the Southeast Asian nation. An attack on its consulate last week shows that balancing act is becoming untenable.\nChina has demanded an investigation and lodged \"serious protests\" with the Myanmar authorities after its consulate in Mandalay, the country\u2019s second-largest city, was hit on Friday with an explosive device \u2014 reportedly a grenade. It\u2019s unclear who was responsible for the incident, which was quickly condemned by the junta and pro-democracy forces.\nBoth sides have been angered by recent actions from China under President Xi Jinping. Min Aung Hlaing, whose overthrow of the civilian government led by Aung San Suu Kyi in 2021 renewed a civil war, signalled his annoyance with Beijing after it appeared last year to back rebel groups in an operation to clear out scam centres taking advantage of Chinese citizens.\nADVERTISEMENT\nAds powered by\nThe success of that offensive raised the possibility that Min Aung Hlaing's regime could collapse, and the armed ethnic groups would take control of Myanmar. Faced with that scenario, China began exerting more pressure on the rebels to stick to their sphere of influence in the northern areas of the country, backing the government in a move to ensure the nation didn\u2019t devolve into chaos.\nRELATED\nworld\nUS and China swap prisoners\nopinion\nLike bamboo swaying in the wind\n\"While it's no fan of this regime, it definitely doesn't want a disorderly kind of collapse of power in Naypyidaw because it doesn't know what comes next,\" Richard Horsey, senior Myanmar adviser with the International Crisis Group, said of China. \"It worries that would be even worse,\" he added. \"Unpredictable kinds of outcomes are not what they want.\"\nIn additional to its losses in the north, recent reports show the junta is on the verge of being expelled from the western-most state bordering Bangladesh, while others show it has lost control of townships covering about 86% of the country, raising questions over how long the generals can retain power.\nIn early August, Min Aung Hlaing's forces suffered one of their most significant military defeats yet with the loss of Lashio, the capital of the northern Shan State. That potentially opens the way for an assault on Mandalay, which is connected by highway to Naypyidaw, the capital, and Yangon, the nation's biggest city.\n\"If successful, such an operation would open an avenue for attacks on the capital at Naypyidaw, posing an existential threat to the regime,\" reads an assessment published this month by the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies. \"The recent fall of Lashio has placed the Myanmar military in its most vulnerable position since the 2021 coup.\"\nWhether an attack on Mandalay happens, and which groups would be involved, is unclear. Observers, however, point to sporadic gains in the region by forces loyal to a parallel government set up by ousted lawmakers.\nThe alliance of ethnic-armed groups in the north began to make real progress last October, when it routed junta forces from some key strongholds. The \u201cThree Brotherhood Alliance,\u201d as they are known, also sought to eradicate cybercrime syndicates operating in the area that had been siphoning billions of dollars from Chinese citizens since the Covid-19 pandemic. Working in tandem with Chinese authorities, the groups helped transfer tens of thousands of suspects back across the border to China.\nThe military\u2019s nationalist backers soon hit the streets to protest China's perceived support. Min Aung Hlaing himself used speeches to rail against unnamed foreign countries for supporting his enemies with food, money and other provisions \u2014 clear references to China, which has long pledged to maintain a non-interference stance in Myanmar\u2019s domestic affairs.\nAs the rebel groups gained strength, China moved to broker a cease-fire in January that fell apart only months later. Once the ethnic army began overrunning junta positions further south, those groups say Beijing started using economic coercion and vague threats of retribution to halt their advance.\n\"The Chinese government has pressured us to stop fighting and not make any offensive moves,\" Lway Yay Oo, spokesman of Ta'ang National Liberation Army active in Shan State, told\nBloomberg News\n. China has since imposed travel restrictions in the areas they control and restricted border trade including access to pharmaceuticals, she said.\nAsked in an August briefing if China told the group to stop fighting, Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian didn\u2019t answer directly, saying that Xi's government has been working to promote a cease-fire.\n\"As Myanmar's biggest neighbouring country, China has all along sincerely hoped that Myanmar will achieve stability and development, and has worked actively to this end,\" he told reporters. \"China will continue to play a constructive role for Myanmar's peace and reconciliation process and promote the de-escalation in northern Myanmar.\"\nDuring a recent summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations in Laos, Myanmar's neighbours expressed frustration that efforts to stop the violence have failed. Singapore Prime Minister Lawrence Wong called on partner nations like China to \"lean forward\" and pressure Myanmar authorities to end the war.\nChina has recently ramped up public engagements with the junta. Its top diplomat, Foreign Minister Wang Yi, touted the longstanding \"pauk-phaw friendship\" between the two countries \u2014 a phrase Chinese officials say means \u201cbrothers born together\" \u2014 in August talks with Min Aung Hlaing. The junta chief is reportedly set to travel to China next month in what would be his first known trip there since the coup.\nA visit from Min Aung Hlaing to meet officials in Beijing \"will be a clear policy pivot from China,\" according to Horsey of the International Crisis Group. \"If he was to meet Xi Jinping, that would be an even more significant move. So, China's trying to undo the damage.\"\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat is your budget range for purchasing a condominium?\nUnder 2 million THB\n2 million - 4 million THB\n4 million - 7 million THB\n7 million - 10 million THB\nOver 10 million THB\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nXi jinping\nChina\nMyanmar\nJunta\nViolence\nMin Aung Hlaingm\nAsean\nDo you like the content of this article?\n6\n37\nCOMMENT",

(Photo: Wiang Phang Kham municipal office)\nCommunities in\nChiang Rai\nand\nChiang Mai\nprovinces have been hit by\ntwo waves of flooding\nin the past several weeks, with locals describing these as the worst\nfloods\nin decades.\nAlthough the floodwater in most areas\nhas since receded\n, residents and volunteers are still clearing the sludge covering the streets and people's homes.\nThe heavy flooding and its aftermath have left many pondering the factors that contributed to the disaster.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe Bangkok Post talked to experts in water management and engineering who suggested the authorities reconsider urban planning and seek collaboration with Myanmar to address future cross-boundary flood risks.\nChange of land use\nThanapon: Mud volumes suspiciously high\nRELATED\nlearning\nChinese, Taiwanese gamblers arrested in Bangkok\nthailand\nVNPAY\u2019s Drive for a Cashless Future in Vietnam: Shifting from Cash to Click\nThanapon Piman, a senior researcher at the Stockholm Environment Institute, said the flood that ravaged Mae Sai district of Chiang Rai province was unusual -- not only for its frequency but also for the massive amount of mud it brought with it.\nThis could be attributed to the seasonal rainfall that began in August, combined with the influence of Typhoon Yagi, which brought heavy rain to Myanmar. The excess water, along with mud, flowed into the Mae Sai River, suggesting there was a change in land use in headwater areas.\nMr Thanapon said the mud had two sources: natural landslides and agriculture or mining in forest areas. Meanwhile, exposed topsoil became mud in the river.\n\"However, while there are no statistics on this, my assumption is the large amount of mud didn't come solely from nearby areas,\" he said. \"Over 80% of it likely originates from the Mae Sai River watershed.\"\nThe flood was not caused by the release of excess water from upstream dams in Laos and China as some thought, he said. Coping with future flood risks is a huge challenge, especially when the Thai side is located downstream.\nIn the short term, apart from rehabilitating flood-ravaged communities, opening water-level monitoring stations in the headwaters of the Mae Sai River is a must-do to serve as an early warning system, he said.\nNext is developing a more efficient disaster response plan or improving city planning, Mr Thanapon said.\nHowever, that would be an uphill task because the area is a special economic zone and people are unlikely to relocate. An evacuation plan should be in place to ensure those in risk-prone areas are safely evacuated during a flood.\nIn the long term, the central government must step in because local authorities do not have adequate resources to manage the situation -- whether to restore flood protection barriers or improve water drainage capacity through the irrigation system.\nMr Thanapon stressed the need to foster collaboration with Myanmar, saying cooperation must be multi-dimensional, engaging communities, businesses and academic input.\nThis is a cross-border issue that affects both countries, and the area is not only under the control of the Myanmar government but also under the control of ethnic minorities and armed groups, he added.\n\"Managing water is easier than tackling the issue of mud, as the latter involves land use and requires much more time,\" he said. \"We need to persuade our neighbour to be aware of the soil erosion problem.\n\"Both sides also have a lot of work to do because there is no data on the amount of mud, which is essential for planning and decision-making,\" he said.\nFlood mitigation needed\nSuchatvee: Incentivise relocation to safe areas\nSuchatvee Suwansawat, a former president of the Engineering Institute of Thailand, said the flooding was caused by global warming and human activities, such as deforestation and encroachment on riverbanks.\nThe issue requires a strong will from the government, particularly Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra, who must bring together state agencies to develop an urban plan and ensure it is strictly enforced to ensure sustainability, he said.\nMr Suchatvee said communities in water retention areas should be made aware of the situation and offered incentives to relocate.\n\"It happens every year, and how bad depends on the amount of water. If the government and the public do not cooperate, it will get worse each year,\" he said.\nMr Thanapon said several buildings on the Thai side near the First Friendship Bridge obstruct the water flow and dismantling them could enable faster drainage and allow for the construction of flood barriers.\nRegarding Mae Sai's Sailom Joy Market, a border market severely hit by floods, he said if businesses are to remain in their current locations, the buildings must be at least two storeys high to allow occupants to move to the upper floors during a flood.\nHe admitted residents may struggle to finance renovations and the proposal may require the collaboration of multiple sectors. He noted that businesses may need to relocate if the situation is critical.\nAs for flooding in the city of Chiang Mai, Mr Thanapon said urban communities have limited knowledge about how to cope because they do not face the problem regularly.\nHe said the \"Chiang Mai model\" is not enough to deal with extremely high levels of floodwater.\nThat would require a multi-million-baht project, such as a large drainage tunnel beneath the city, to cope with flooding. However, stakeholders will have to determine whether such an investment is worth it.\nOn revising the city plan, he said its success relies on the cooperation of the public and those responsible for enforcing city planning laws.\nHe said people in Chiang Mai should realise that flooding can occur at any time, and given the amount of water, flooding is inevitable because there is no way to divert it elsewhere.\nKey venues, such as hospitals, should explore methods to mitigate damage from flooding and consider the measures taken by the Shangri-La Hotel, which used a flood barrier to protect the premises.\n\"The public must understand that flooding is unavoidable, but its impact can be mitigated for key locations. Fortunately, this time the Bhumibol dam could still take water, which helped with drainage,\" he said.\nReclaiming flood plains\nPianporn: Solutions must be 'nature-based'\nPianporn Deetes, campaign director for the Southeast Asia Programme at the International Rivers Network, said the flooding in Chiang Rai and Chiang Mai indicates water retention areas have been occupied by people amid uncontrolled expansion of cities.\nAerial photographs showed the rivers overflowed into the same areas that had flooded in the past, as if the rivers were reclaiming their former territory.\nIn the case of the Mae Sai River, she said the section near the 1st Friendship Bridge used to be much wider but structures on both the Thai and Myanmar sides have encroached on the riverbanks.\nUpstream there are areas of exposed soil as the result of mining activities which may also contribute to the mudslides, she said.\n\"To reduce the severity of future flooding, it's time we have a good understanding of extreme changes in climate. The earth is 'boiling' and we need nature-based solutions like preserving wetlands, rather than trying to control the river,\" she said.\nShe agreed that international cooperation is needed to deal with transboundary flooding but said addressing the issue is a challenge for the government because the border areas involve several ethnic groups and participation from all sides is necessary.\nMs Pianporn also criticised authorities for their lack of preparedness in terms of warnings and responses.\nShe said those who suffer the most are the poor and the marginalised, and the government must find ways to help people rebuild their lives and livelihoods.\n\"I visited the Nam Kok community in Chiang Rai and saw the debris from small food shops. An electrician lost both his home and his tools while a community that grew vegetables was completely wiped out,\" she said.\nVideo: Flooding, smog and climate change: the land use connection\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat is your preferred house size (in terms of number of bedrooms)?\n1 bedroom\n2\u20133 bedrooms\n4+ bedrooms\nNo preference\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nThailand\nChiang Rai\nChiang Mai\nFlood\n\u0e40\u0e0a\u0e35\u0e22\u0e07\u0e23\u0e32\u0e22\n\u0e40\u0e0a\u0e35\u0e22\u0e07\u0e43\u0e2b\u0e21\u0e48\n\u0e2d\u0e38\u0e17\u0e01\u0e20\u0e31\u0e22\nPrevention\nMud\nDo you like the content of this article?\n34\n47\nCOMMENT\n(14)",

Thailand's growth rates in the first quarter of 2024 fell behind all Asean member countries except Myanmar. These facts cast serious doubts on the efficacy of traditional economic development strategies. The primary goal of enhancing the well-being of Thai citizens is at stake.\nThis article adopts a system dynamics approach, a comprehensive method and proposes actionable solutions. It focuses on four critical subsystems: political, demographic, social, and economic.\nIn the political realm, policy decisions and governance structures directly affect economic growth, demographic trends, and social stability. For instance, political stability and effective governance can create a regulatory environment that attracts higher-quality FDI, boosting economic growth. Conversely, ineffective public affairs management and political turmoil deter FDI, undermine its impact, destabilise the economy, and exacerbate social tensions.\nADVERTISEMENT\nDemographics shape economic and social outcomes, such as population growth, age distribution, and migration patterns. A growing youthful population can provide a robust labour force, driving economic expansion.\nHowever, if the economy cannot absorb this labour force, it may lead to high unemployment, social unrest, and increased political pressure. On the other hand, an ageing population may strain social services and economic productivity, necessitating political interventions to address the needs of older persons to maintain financial stability. Additionally, inward or outward migration patterns can significantly impact the labour market and economic and social dynamics.\nEconomic conditions impact political governance, human capital, and social services. Economic growth funds social programmes and contributes to political stability, creating a positive feedback loop. Conversely, downturns lead to budget cuts, reducing social service quality and increasing political tensions. Financial policies also influence migration, as people seek better opportunities, thus affecting demographics.\nThailand requires a national leader skilled in system dynamic management, capable of creating and capitalising on positive feedback loops across critical subsystems. Positive feedback loops amplify beneficial interactions, such as effective governance improving economic performance, which enhances social services, leading to a healthier, more educated population that supports further economic growth.\nConversely, negative feedback loops can worsen political instability, leading to economic decline, reduced social services, and deteriorating demographic conditions. Understanding these interactions and feedback mechanisms is crucial for developing holistic and sustainable solutions to Thailand's challenges.\nAmong many dimensions, the national leader must understand the concept of a leverage point to identify where to begin impactful change. In Thailand, the political subsystem is the critical leverage point. Addressing political stability and governance can initiate positive feedback loops, enhancing economic performance, social services, and overall societal well-being, leading to sustainable development. The leader's understanding and effective use of this leverage point will be crucial in driving the necessary changes.\nAside from possessing a system-dynamic management perspective, the leader of the future Thailand must be transformative, visionary, and passionate about national prosperity and the well-being of all citizens. Such a leader will inspire and drive comprehensive reforms, ensuring sustainable development and a brighter future for the nation. This transformative leadership is crucial for inspiring hope and confidence in Thailand's economic future.\nTo move into the future, we must analyse our past. Since 1932, when it adopted a Western-style constitutional democratic monarchy, Thailand has predominately been ruled directly by a coup leader or by a person chosen by the military junta. While these leaders were respectable, they were more interested in protecting the status quo, particularly of the ruling class and high-ranking bureaucrats.\nThe sectoral management approaches of the past must become more active and suitable for dealing with dynamic, complex, and interconnected challenges. Their contributions, though significant, were limited and not necessarily cumulative. Some of them were at odds with each other. Consequently, Thailand has yet to move very far forward.\nThailand can learn valuable lessons from the transformative experiences of China, Singapore, and South Korea, each applying a systematic management approach to political transformation to become economic powerhouses.\nThese nations prioritised political stability as the bedrock for economic and social development. For instance, under Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore established a meritocratic and corruption-free government, which fostered a stable and predictable environment for business and foreign investment. Similarly, Deng Xiaoping's China maintained political control while decentralising economic decision-making, allowing local governments to tailor policies that spurred rapid industrial growth.\nPark Chung-hee's authoritarian yet strategic governance in South Korea focused on coordinated Five-Year Plans that synchronised industrial, educational, and infrastructural development. This comprehensive planning ensured robust social services and technological advancements supported economic growth.\nCommon to all three nations was the emphasis on building strong institutions that upheld law and order, reduced corruption, and facilitated efficient governance. These leaders also understood the importance of inclusive development, ensuring that economic benefits were widely shared to maintain social cohesion and public support.\nBy adopting these principles, Thailand can develop a holistic strategy integrating political reforms with economic and social policies. This includes promoting meritocracy, strengthening institutions, and implementing long-overdue strategic political transformation. Such an approach will drive economic growth and enhance social well-being and political stability, positioning Thailand as a leading economic force in the region.\nPeerasit Kamnuansilpa\nKhon Kaen University Dean\nPeerasit Kamnuansilpa is Dean, College of Local Administration Khon Kaen University.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nHow important are environmental sustainability practices (e.g., eco-friendly rooms, waste reduction) when choosing accommodation in Thailand?

The internecine war between the military junta, known as the State Administration Council (SAC), and the various ethnic armed organisations (EAOs) continues unabated, with no endgame in sight.\nThe situation has also become increasingly dire, with fighting among the EAOs themselves. Following the Northern Alliance's offensive 1027 late last year. the Tatmadaw, as Myanmar's military is known, has gradually lost control of territory, especially in areas bordering China, Thailand and India. Over the past ten months, the EAOs have been bolstered by military victories through joint and individual offensives.\nAs Vientiane prepares for the Asean Ministerial Meeting (AMM) from July 21-27, the bloc is grappling with the harsh reality of how to approach the Myanmar crisis. As the current Asean chair, Laos strictly adheres to the Five-Point Consensus (5PC) as the guidepost on how the bloc will proceed with Myanmar. However, some Asean members are pushing for more optional approaches towards all stakeholders, intending to jumpstart political dialogue in the future.\nADVERTISEMENT\nLaos has scheduled an informal consultative meeting between the current, past, and future rotating chairs on July 24 to review the implementation of 5PC. Thailand first proposed it after the coup in 2021, but no consensus was reached back then. Early this year, the troika idea was revived following the implementation of the Thai-Myanmar humanitarian assistance plan.\nHowever, the resignation of former deputy prime minister and foreign minister, Parnpree Bahiddha-Nukara in May caused a hiccup in Thailand's efforts to advance the aid plans. As of now, Thailand has yet to name a new chief for the special committee to scrutinise the Myanmar crisis, which used to be headed by Mr Parnpree.\nRELATED\nbusiness\nCasinos a game-changer for Thai tourism, says Agoda\nthailand\nPM to tackle disparity at meets\nThe rotational chairs' meeting is crucial to further maintain the progress under their respective leadership. It will indicate the scope and scale of Indonesia and Malaysia's involvement in the future. Last year, Indonesia held more than 100 meetings with Myanmar's stakeholders. Both countries have been critical of Nay Pyi Taw since the coup. Furthermore, the meeting can decide if they wish to expand the troika formula to troika-plus.\nOn humanitarian assistance, Thailand wants to see the assistance plan extended to include other dialogue partners and UN special agencies, especially those related to food and health security. The new UN special envoy on Myanmar, Julie Bishop, has been travelling throughout Asean to learn firsthand about the situation in Myanmar. During her latest visit to Thailand, she told Foreign Minister Maris Sangiampongsa that she intended to work with all concerned parties and Asean while keeping a low profile and avoiding publicity. She reiterated that Thailand is a significant player in finding solutions to the situation in Myanmar.\nAhead of the upcoming AMM, Alounkeo Kittikhoun, the current Asean special envoy, has been trying to extract further concessions from the SAC, such as the release of additional political prisoners, stopping violence against civilians, and expanding humanitarian assistance programmes. Without \"substantive progress\" in these areas, it will be difficult for the Asean chair to invite a senior Myanmar official to attend the bloc's annual conferences. In January, Laos invited an acting permanent secretary for foreign affairs to attend the retreat. Myanmar has already been stripped of the chairmanship in 2026, which will be assumed by the Philippines.\nMeanwhile, some Asean members have increased their contacts and communications with the overseas representatives of the National Unity Government (NUG), the civilian government formed in opposition to the military coup, to heap pressure on the SAC. However, they are not ready to recognise the NUG, although some have threatened to do so.\nLooking forward, the 5PC remains the effective framework to which all concerned parties must adhere, including the bloc's four powerful dialogue partners--the US, China, India, and Russia. Lately, these great powers have intensified their engagement with various stakeholders, keeping their agendas in mind.\nRecently, US Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, Daniel Kritenbrink, held a second meeting in Hanoi with senior Myanmar officials, signalling Washington's willingness to engage the SAC. The first meeting, in February, took place in an airport hotel in Bangkok with junior officials from Myanmar. During the brief democratic period from 2011-2021, Washington normalised ties with Myanmar after a series of concessions from Nay Pyi Taw. The meetings with the SAC showed Washington's eagerness to leverage its role with other great regional players.\nWith their common borders, China and India have long been engaging with the SAC and EAOs straddling their adjacent territories. At the end of June, China invited former Myanmar's president Thein Sein to attend the 70th anniversary of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. His visit was followed by the junta's Commander-in-chief, Gen Soe Win, who was in Qingdao, Shandong province, to participate in a sustainable development forum. These high-level visits came amid intensified fighting in Myanmar's Northeastern region. In the future, these two powerful figures could be on invitation lists of key Asean members.\nLast week, at the Bimstec foreign minister (Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation) retreat in New Delhi, Indian Foreign Minister S Jaishankar met with his Myanmar's counterpart, U Than Swe, reiterating India's support for Myanmar to return to democracy in Myanmar. India has been a strong supporter of track 1.5 meetings, initiated by Bangkok, to address other key issues of illegal narcotics, arms trade and displaced persons for the countries bordering Myanmar. On the sidelines of the retreat, foreign ministers from Thailand, India and Myanmar also held a meeting to discuss their mutual concerns.\nOf late, Asean has closely watched Russia's role in Myanmar's conflict. Lest we forget, Moscow has not meaningfully endorsed the 5PC. Russia remains an outlier. With ongoing international isolation imposed after the invasion of Ukraine, Russia is strengthening ties with the developing countries in the Global South, especially Southeast Asia.\nThese powerful dialogue partners can also pressure the SAC to implement the 5PC fully. At this crucial juncture, some of their activities and schemes, including the so-called \"non-lethal\" assistance, could directly impact the Asean centrality and the current peace efforts. It is imperative that Asean collaborate and work on the same page to prevent the SAC from playing one power against the other.\nWith the geopolitical shifts, the SAC must recognise that now is the time to act positively to the Lao chair's suggestions, as the fatigue level within Asean is kicking in. Time is running out for the SAC as its economy is worsening by the hour, and public outrage against the junta's atrocities is growing by the day.\nFor Asean, the stakes are high. If the crisis is not contained and resolved, outside players can assert their influence and turn the situation into a proxy war, as has happened in other parts of the world. The region must avoid this predicament at all costs.\nKavi Chongkittavorn\nA veteran journalist on regional affairs\nKavi Chongkittavorn is a veteran journalist on regional affairs\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWould you consider buying a house in a gated community or as a standalone property?\nGated community\nStandalone house\nEither, depending on location and price\nNo preference\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nMyanmar\nBurma\nFight\nCivil war\nDo you like the content of this article?\n5\n36\nCOMMENT\n(13)",

Each strand and stitch reflects the inspiration from nature, local ways of life and diverse ethnic cultures,\" Ms Chotiros said.\n\"This motivates me to use my knowledge in marketing to commercialise the work of these artisans to improve communities' livelihoods and income in a sustainable way, while also preserving their ethnic identity.\"\nShe said her passion for handwoven textiles produced by local weavers led to the establishment of Welcome to Chiang Rai in December 2023.\nThe Community Development Department later introduced the company to 32 entrepreneurs in Chiang Rai keen on using silk and Tai Lue textiles to create a variety of products to decorate shirts, jeans, blazers, hats, scarves and crochet tote bags.\nEXPERIENCE COUNTS\n\"The people who make products for us include both elderly and disabled people aged between 50-75, for whom embroidery has long been part of their everyday lives. The company wants to play a role in helping to create jobs and generate sustainable income for the community,\" said Ms Chotiros.\n\"Instead of producing large items of clothing, which is time-consuming, expensive, and can only be worn only during festivals, we opt to produce smaller pieces that are timeless or can be worn in a variety of settings.\n\"The influx of Chinese products into Thailand has not had a significant impact on the company as our products are handmade and unique, whereas mass-produced items from China are manufactured in factories.\"\nUnesco designated Chiang Rai a \"Creative City of Design\" in 2023.\nKEEPING THE SKILLS ALIVE\nThe company teamed up with Chiang Rai Vocational College to develop a curriculum for textile design featuring an introduction to textiles, yarns, textile materials, fabric designs and advanced drawing.\nVocational students have the opportunity to learn about these subjects and related skills, while working with 32 entrepreneurs in Chiang Rai, with the first cohort scheduled for next month.\nThe programme will provide opportunities for students to sell their craft items, while preparing them for a wide range of careers in the textile and fashion industry, she said.\nMs Chotiros said the company's products are available for sale at Jungceylon in Phuket and Emsphere in Bangkok, with negotiations are ongoing for placement at King Power outlets.\nWelcome to Chiang Rai plans to expand its sales channel to Central Chiang Mai and Central Pattaya, with new stores planned in Yangon, Myanmar and Bodh Gaya, India by year-end, she said.\n\"Instead of promoting the sale of an entire work as a masterpiece, which is less affordable and likely worn in limited circumstances, the company proposes the government elevate craft fabrics by producing small pieces for use as decoration for suits and bags. These could be worn in a variety of settings and exported to other markets, rather than limited to the main markets such as Japan and Europe,\" said Ms Chotiros.\nThe local wisdom and creativity of these cultural assets should be leveraged to increase economic value that promotes the country's soft power, she said.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat type of accommodation do you usually prefer when traveling in Thailand?\nLuxury hotels (5-star)\nMid-range hotels (3-4 star)\nHostels and guesthouses\nPrivate rentals (Airbnb or villas)\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nWelcome to Chiang Rai Co Ltd\nChotiros Thatthaisong\nDo you like the content of this article?\n13\n3\nCOMMENT\n(3)",

(Photo: Varuth Hirunyatheb)\nHindsight is likely to place\nSrettha Thavisin\nin Thai political annals as a prime minister who tried his best but ultimately succumbed to\nforces way beyond his control\n. While his nearly 12-month tenure in office came up short on policy deliverables, it nevertheless reset Thailand's foreign policy projection on Myanmar amid more omnidirectional relations with the major powers.\nTo be sure, Mr Srettha's domestic policy agenda was stymied and obstructed from the outset. The lesson for his successor, Prime Minster Paetongtarn Shinawatra, is that policy progress depends less on merit and more on the bargaining and alignment of interests with forces behind the scenes.\nTo be sure, Mr Srettha's rise to the premiership was unwitting, a result of his connection with Pheu Thai founder Thaksin Shinawatra and his sister and also former prime minister Yingluck Shinawatra and the military-inspired 2017 constitution, whereby all political parties contesting the 2023 general election had to come up with a slate of up to three candidates for prime minister. Most major parties forwarded just one, but the Pheu Thai Party proposed three in late 2022 because it had faced dissolutions and premiership disqualifications in the past.\nADVERTISEMENT\nMs Paetongtarn and Chaikasem Nitisiri, the party's elderly legal hand, were the other two. When the Move Forward Party won the poll but was kept away from office by constitutional means, Pheu Thai was co-opted in a bargain that brought its founder, Thaksin Shinawatra, back from exile on the same day that Mr Srettha received sufficient votes from the military-appointed Senate to take the helm.\nHeading a coalition government combining Pheu Thai with pro-military parties that had conspired to overthrow Ms Yingluck's government in a military coup in 2014, Mr Srettha's outsider status was his main strength and chief weakness. As an outsider, he was not beholden to vested interests and patronage politics that underpin elections and coalition governments. His billionaire status from family-owned property development was measured in baht rather than dollars. Mr Srettha pitched himself as a successful businessman in a technocratic fashion to help get the Thai economy out of its persistent doldrums.\nRELATED\nbusiness\nIndonesian tycoon eyes theme park, F1 in $16bn project\nthailand\nMinister backs bill for Thailand's 20 million informal workers\nHe made a host of foreign trips to drum up foreign investments and to show that Thailand now had an elected government after years of military-authoritarian rule and that the country was once again open for business. Mr Srettha met with Chinese President Xi Jinping and attended China's Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation in October 2023. But unlike his immediate predecessor, he showed that Thailand was no longer as reliant on Chinese support as in the coup years by visiting myriad other countries. At the main dinner of the Apec summit in San Francisco in November 2023, he was seated next to US President Joe Biden.\nOn Myanmar, Thailand finally corrected its wayward course of supporting the junta in Nay Pyi Taw during Bangkok's previous military-backed regime. Under the Srettha government, former Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Parnpree Bahiddha-nukara made headway and gained the trust of resistance forces by recognising and engaging them directly and by providing humanitarian assistance and overall goodwill.\nIt was a more balanced approach, and Thailand needed to play a leading role in Asean in search of a way forward in Myanmar. Mr Parnpree should now feel vindicated for his decision to quit the government last April after a cabinet reshuffle dropped his dual deputy PM post. Coalition politics and power plays behind the scenes are not worth putting up with in view of what's happened to Mr Srettha.\nA self-proclaimed \"salesman\" for Thailand everywhere he went, Mr Srettha sought investments from big tech in Silicon Valley and infrastructure investors in the Middle East, South Asia, and elsewhere in Asia and Europe.\nIn fact, he seemed desperate to mobilise foreign investment to shore up the Thai economy, whose trend growth had declined by more than half to just 1.5% annually during the previous nine years under military-backed rule. But Mr Srettha really had no chance of succeeding.\nHis domestic policy initiatives, particularly the 10,000-baht digital wallet scheme for each of 50 million Thais to spur consumption and boost growth, faced legal opposition from the beginning. The \"land bridge\" scheme to link the Gulf of Thailand with the Andaman Sea did not gain traction. The \"soft power\" projects to harness Thailand's cultural capital did not gain momentum. The pending free-trade agreements with the European Union and European Free Trade Association are still awaiting a conclusion and were surpassed instead by the Thai FTA with Sri Lanka, which was unsubstantial and not comprehensive in coverage. In turn, Mr Srettha had to grab what he could to deliver economic growth, thereby resorting to visa-free tourism from China and Russia.\nAfter six months in office, Mr Srettha appeared exasperated. While Move Forward was being lined up for dissolution, Mr Srettha faced a petition from an expiring lot of 40 military-appointed senators for a cabinet reshuffle that put in Pichit Chuenban, who was convicted and jailed in 2008 for trying to bribe court officials on behalf of Mr Thaksin and his wife, as a junior minister in violation of the constitution. Mr Pichit, well known in political circles as a trusted legal aid of the Shinawatra family, was a cabinet choice beyond Mr Srettha's control. As an outsider who could work without the baggage of vested interests, Mr Srettha's weakness was that he had no support base within the Pheu Thai Party. The reshuffle, as with the earlier government formation, was not his doing but it eventually became his undoing.\nHe was unceremoniously sacked by the Constitutional Court in a 5-4 verdict. Removing a sitting prime minister with such a narrow margin was astounding. On closer scrutiny, it has also become controversial.\nOne of the five judges in favour of Mr Srettha's disqualification, Udom Sitthiwirattham, publicly stated two weeks ago that Move Forward Party's leaders should be grateful for his dissolution decision because its successor Prachachon (People's) Party has received tens of million baht in public donations in a matter of days. To the extent that this remark showed undue contempt and prejudice towards the Move Forward Party, Mr Srettha should take comfort in the judgement on his role as premier.\nIn the end, what happened to Mr Srettha was somewhat analogous to the fate of Samak Sundaravej, a veteran politician who became prime minister in 2008 by leading Pheu Thai's earlier banner under the Palang Prachachon (People's Power) Party as a Thaksin nominee. With ultra-right-wing credentials, Samak thought he could help bridge the gap between the conservative establishment and the Thaksin camp. Yet much of his premiership coincided with rabid yellow-shirt protests that eventually laid the ground for the Constitutional Court to disqualify him for hosting a cooking show on TV and receiving a token honorarium for it.\nThe name of the game for the establishment is to divide and rule, use and expend, as situations and circumstances require. Put this way, Mr Srettha's demise at this time in this fashion is probably better than later in worse ways.\nThitinan Pongsudhirak, PhD, is professor at the Faculty of Political Science and a senior fellow at its Institute of Security and International Studies.\nThitinan Pongsudhirak\nSenior fellow of the Institute of Security and International Studies at Chulalongkorn University\nA professor and senior fellow of the Institute of Security and International Studies at Chulalongkorn University\u2019s Faculty of Political Science, he earned a PhD from the London School of Economics with a top dissertation prize in 2002.

(Photo: Ken Bohn/San Diego Zoo Safari Park/handout via Reuters)\nHONG KONG: China's only higher education institute to offer giant panda studies is set to enrol its first students this autumn, giving them the opportunity to observe the bears closely at nature reserves, state broadcaster CCTV reported.\nThe \"giant panda college\" is affiliated with China West Normal University in Sichuan, the southwestern province known for its panda reserves and habitats. The institute was established in September by the provincial forestry and grassland administration.\nA total of 50 undergraduate students will study wildlife and nature reserve management at the Giant Panda Institute, which is expected to promote the \"academic, professional and systematic development of giant panda conservation\", according to the CCTV report on Wednesday.\nADVERTISEMENT\nAds powered by\nThe students will gain hands-on experience at the institute and take part in work related to giant panda conservation, breeding and disease prevention in national nature reserves.\nThey are expected to become professionals in wildlife protection and research after four to seven years of study.\nWei Wei, an instructor at the Giant Panda Institute, told CCTV that the institution's professors and instructors included 22 experts from the Institute of Zoology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the China Conservation and Research Centre for the Giant Panda.\nChina has put decades of effort into panda conservation. The total number of wild giant pandas in China has increased from about 1,100 in the 1980s to nearly 1,900 today. The International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List of Threatened Species has downgraded the giant panda from \"endangered\" to \"vulnerable\".\nBeijing frequently sends giant pandas overseas in a soft-power bid to improve ties and win the hearts of people in foreign countries - a practice known as \"panda diplomacy\".\nThe bears are usually loaned to other countries for 10 years as envoys of goodwill and friendship and serve as barometers of relations between China and the host country.\nGiant pandas Yun Chuan and Xin Bao arrived at the San Diego Zoo on June 27, making them the first pandas to travel to the United States from China in more than 20 years. They are on loan to the California zoo and are reportedly adjusting to their new home. They are not quite ready to meet visitors yet, zoo officials said this week.\nChinese internet users launched a social media campaign in February of last year calling for the return of Ya Ya, a female panda sent to the Memphis Zoo two decades ago, after she appeared to be thin and missing clumps of fur in photos. Ya Ya returned to China in April 2023 at the end of a 20-year loan agreement between the zoo and the Chinese Association of Zoological Gardens.\nA bear named Fubao - the first giant panda born in South Korea - was the centre of another controversy when she was transferred to China in April.

This event unveiled future plans and aims to elevate cooperation in the healthcare industry, trade economy, and culture between China and Thailand, transforming a new dimension of China-Thailand development cooperation for sustainable growth. The event was honoured by the presence of Mr. Jakkapong Sangmanee, Minister Attached to the Prime Minister's Office, and Mr. Krisda Tanterdtit, Secretary to the Minister of Commerce, as well as representatives from the Chinese Embassy in Thailand, the Chairman of the Chinese Cultural Relics Association, and the Vice Chairman of China News Service. The senior management of the Reignwood Group warmly welcomed the attendees.\nMr. Krisda Tanterdtit, Secretary to the Minister of Commerce, gave a speech at the event, stating that ASEAN and China have a strategic partnership relationship in all dimensions - political, economic, social, and cultural. He mentioned that the Ministry of Commerce places great importance on promoting cooperation with various provinces in China and on strengthening economic cooperation to promote sustainable joint economic growth that benefits all countries in the region.\n\"The world is currently restructuring its trade patterns and relationships to become a form of cultural marketing, in order to transmit valuable cultures to various countries around the world. As the Ministry of Commerce is pushing Thailand's Soft Power policy in the areas of food, industries, and lifestyles, Thailand is confident that it can be an important strategic trade partner for China in the ASEAN region. This is because Thailand has a geographical advantage as the centre of the Greater Mekong Subregion and ASEAN, and can serve as a hub for trade, investment, and logistics in the ASEAN region. Therefore, if China and ASEAN have cooperation in cultural exchange, it can lead to the expansion of cultural exchange at the youth level, and the joint development of international educational standards, truly driving social understanding between the two sides,\" said Mr. Krisda.\nADVERTISEMENT\nMs. Woraphanit Ruayrungruang, CEO of International Business, Reignwood Group, revealed that the East-West Cultural Exchange Center, situated at Reignwood Park, the world-class community for multigenerational living on Lam Luk Ka Road, Khlong 11, Pathum Thani, was officially inaugurated on 18 May 2023, and has been a significant venue for continuous cultural exchange activities.\nCelebrating its one-year anniversary, the Reignwood Cultural Foundation hosted the \"Exploring the Future through Cultural Heritage Transmission\" event, titled \"Museums Devoted to Education and Research.\" The objective is to promote the restoration and utilisation of ancient Chinese cultural relics, facilitating cultural exchanges between Chinese and Thai youth.\nHighlights of the event include showcasing young people's interests and hobbies to deepen their understanding of traditional Chinese and Thai cultures. Selected artworks and works related to China-Thailand cultural exchanges will be showcased, and certificates of recognition will be awarded to \"Reignwood Global Little Ambassadors.\"\nFuture plans include promoting economic, trade, and cultural exchanges between China and Thailand, strengthening cooperation with local governments and organisations, and expanding cooperation projects in various sectors.\nMs. Lu Zhan, Secretary-General of Reignwood Cultural Foundation, announced the special programme \"Reignwood Global Young Ambassadors\" which aims to select and train talented Thai-Chinese youth to become ambassadors promoting friendship between the two countries.

Mr Macron was the first EU leader to visit Thailand.\u2009(Photo: AFP)\nIn April 2022, Thailand learned that French President Emmanuel Macron was keen to engage with the Asia-Pacific region in person. As the host of the 32nd Asia-Pacific Economic Leaders' Meeting (Apec) in October of that year, former deputy prime minister and foreign minister Don Pramudwinai quickly issued an invitation to the president to attend as a guest. The rest, as they say, is history.\nMr Macron visited Bangkok and attended the Apec meeting, the first EU leader to do so -- making headline news. It was a highly successful summit despite the absence of US President Joe Biden. During the trip, as a non-Apec member but the leader of a leading economic and political power, the French president was able to highlight France's regional and global economic role in the Indo-Pacific. He also met with Apec leaders on the sidelines of the event.\nMost importantly, he won the hearts and minds of Thais by choosing to roam Bangkok's streets and watch Muay Thai just like an ordinary visitor. His demeanour over here was extraordinary, and he subsequently laid down additional distinctive pillars for the two countries to diversify and deepen their three centuries-old bilateral ties. Now, both soft power and hard power have become top priorities in the Thai-French friendship.\nADVERTISEMENT\nFrance was the first European country to come out with an Indo-Pacific strategy back in 2018. Its involvement and consequences during the colonial period in Indochina and the Pacific are well documented. Today, France takes up a different role. The republic wants to approach familiar turf with a new attitude and spirit -- a mutually beneficial relationship encompassing all aspects. Notably, France is the only Western country with its own Indo-Pacific strategy that still maintains amiable ties with China. Chinese President Xi Jinping visited Paris in early May.\nSince leaving Bangkok, Mr Macron has been active in global politics, especially in the Ukraine-Russia war, strengthening Nato and EU solidarity and promoting France's Indo-Pacific strategy. As one of the EU's most powerful leaders, his opinions cannot be ignored as they are indicative of international political trends. It, therefore, follows that Thai policymakers, both in the security and economic fields, are determined to bolster their cooperation with France. Today, within Europe, France has the best ties with Thailand. In fact, Thailand wants to establish a strategic partnership with France. However, Paris is still vetting this proposal as it intends to increase strategic engagement with Bangkok, such as cooperation in military education, training and exercise, and cyber and space.\nRELATED\nopinion\nRegional antidotes to counter Trump\nopinion\nAdvancing Asean\nIn Paris on Thursday, Mr Macron will host a lunch for Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin during the Thai PM's six-hour stopover (afterwards, Mr Srettha travels to Rome). These active diplomatic moves between Thai and French leaders are unprecedented both in scope and substance. Travelling with Mr Srettha will be a powerful group of Thai business leaders from corporate giants such as Charoen Pokphand and others.\nGeneral Songwit Noonpakdee, Chief of Defence Forces, will be part of Mr Srettha's delegation but will arrive earlier to lead a group of Thai defence companies to meet their French counterparts. Obviously, France would like to see some defence cooperation between the two countries including arms procurements in addition to commercial aircraft. The Thai Defence Industry and Energy Centre and the French General Directorate for Armaments will also sign a letter of intent to promote their defence sectors.\nIn addition, three MoUs will be signed during the stopover. The first is between CP Foods and Schneider Electric on a strategic partnership on top-tier automation and software solutions. It has the potential to expand energy management for the two countries.\nThe second MoU between state satellite agency Geo-Informatics and Space Technology Development Agency and Starburst Aerospace, a leading aerospace and defence startup accelerator and strategic advisory practice, covers space capability in the future.\nThe third MoU between CP International and Airbus, which is currently being finalised, will focus on the production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) by using feedstock waste, as well as building strong cooperation around logistics optimisation, both on land and in the air, which has great potential for strengthening cooperation between Thailand and France in the areas of energy and logistics.\nAs far as soft power is concerned, at the recent High-Level Economic Dialogue in Paris, both sides agreed to promote soft power in cosmetics, perfume, textiles and fashion lines, especially Thai silk, and in health tourism. Furthermore, they exchanged views on their countries' experience with the bio-circular-green economic model. Last month, Benedicte Epinay, director and CEO of Comite Colbert, was here to exchange knowledge on the branding of luxury goods.\nThe most interesting features of Thai-French relations are the common positions they hold on key international issues -- the Ukraine-Russia war, the Middle East conflict, the Myanmar situation and the climate crisis. Both countries support the initiatives that would end the war in Ukraine. They will also attend the upcoming Peace Conference on Ukraine to be held in Switzerland June 15-16, to which Thailand has been invited.\nThailand and France are on the same page over the Middle East as they endorse the international community's call to de-escalate the Hamas-Israel conflict. Together, they have also appealed for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire and unconditional release of all hostages in the Gaza Strip, including French and Thai hostages. On the situation in Myanmar, they want peace in the country. As a member of the UN Security Council, Thailand hopes that France will support the efforts by Thailand and Asean to provide humanitarian assistance to Myanmar as well as the ongoing implementation of the peace process. Above all, Thailand and France wish to see an end to the current fighting and the start of dialogue.\nDespite pressing domestic issues, both countries are working closely together to boost bilateral ties to a new level. This has been done at the leadership level, and now Mr Srettha is about to make his second visit to France in six months. After the EU normalised ties with Thailand in 2019, France has done the most to reach out to Bangkok. Since then, ties with France have gained greater significance vis-a-vis other Western friends and allies.\nFrance has adopted a new perspective on Thailand after a newly elected government. Paris is pivoting its Indo-China strategy on Bangkok due to its geo-strategic assets and as a hub of connectivity. Both countries also want to maintain their strategic autonomy when engaging with external partners.

Running until April 8, the fair promises an array of literary treasures, with over one million books sprawled across an expansive exhibition area exceeding 20,000m\u00b2.\nDuring a press conference held on March 18, Suwich Rungwattanapaiboon, president of the Publishers and Booksellers Association of Thailand (Pubat), shared insights into the planning and preparation for this event.\n\"We have curated a diverse collection of books, totalling over a million titles from 322 publishers, showcased across 914 meticulously designed booths,\" remarked Suwich, underscoring the scale and depth of offerings awaiting visitors.\nADVERTISEMENT\nA notable element of this year's fair is encapsulated in the theme \"Booklympics\" -- resonating with the upcoming Olympic Games scheduled for July in Paris -- to promote a spirit of celebration and global unity.\nRELATED\nthailand\nBook expo attracts record number of visitors\nlife\n29th Book Expo Thailand kicks off today\nExpounding on the theme, Suwich elaborated: \"Our focus this year revolves around infusing joy and engagement into every facet of the fair. This is palpable in our visually captivating artwork crafted by renowned Thai cartoonist Pakdee Saentaweesuk, also known as Tai Kai-Hua-Roh.\"\nThe event this year unfolds across three key zones -- the Book Zone, Exhibition Zone and Activity Zone, each offering a distinct yet connected experience.\nThe Book Zone is the heart of the fair and is divided into seven categories -- Novel, Literature and Fiction; Book Wonderland, featuring comic books and books for teenagers; Children's and Educational books; Foreign books; General books; Old books; and Non-books.\nSuwich, centre, with athletes Wilawan Aphinyaphong, left, and Pawina Thongsuk.\n\"This comprehensive categorisation ensures that visitors can enjoy works from timeless classics to contemporary masterpieces,\" highlighted Suwich.\nThe Exhibition Zone boasts an engaging line-up, including the \"Cat Country Exhibition\" featuring translated literature by HRH Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn by Nanmee Books Company Limited; the \"Outstanding Book Exhibition 2024\" by the Office of the Basic Education Commission Ministry of Education; the \"Phanwaenfah Prize Literary Exhibition\"; the \"Proud Songkran Exhibition\" by the National Soft Power Strategy Committe; and the \"What Read Exhibition: What Do Famous People Read?\".\nA standout among the activities is the \"Booklympics\" competition, designed to unearth and celebrate talent. Suwich outlined the competition's breadth, encompassing contests such as book cover design, storytelling, proofreading, store display, and a bestseller showcase.\n\"For the best book seller contest, we will let each writer or publisher come up on stage and say anything to promote their books. Then we will check the result at the end of the day to see which book sold the most,\" he explained.\nIn a bid to foster philanthropy and support literature, Pubat has also introduced the \"One Reader Inspires Million People Foundation\" initiative. This initiative seeks to raise funds for reading-promotion agencies facing financial constraint. Additionally, the fair will host the \"Why Books Are Worth Having?\" activity, providing a platform for readers to articulate their perspectives on the profound impact of books in their lives.\nLeveraging technology to enhance engagement and glean insights, Pubat has also partnered with Wisesight to deploy an artificial intelligence system for social media monitoring. Suwich emphasised the strategic significance of this collaboration, enabling real-time monitoring of public sentiment, proactive resolution of potential concerns, and leveraging data analytics to refine future event strategies.\nSimultaneously, the 22nd Bangkok International Book Fair has also garnered substantial traction, surpassing initial expectations. Featuring eleven world-class publishers representing nine countries across 18 booths, the international segment promises global literary and cultural exchange. Participating publishers from Taiwan, Japan, China, Ukraine and other nations will not only showcase books but also offer insights into printing technology, cultural nuances and language learning resources.\nA groundbreaking addition to this year's fair is a collaboration with the Thailand Convention and Exhibition Bureau to host the Bangkok Rights Fair. This dedicated platform facilitates business-to-business interactions for copyright trading between Thai publishers and international agencies. The fair anticipates substantial value generation, with expected copyright trading values exceeding US$10 million (363 million baht).\nIn line with tradition, the fair continues its practice of inviting notable personalities and influencers to enhance its allure. In embracing the \"Booklympics\" theme, the event welcomes distinguished Thai national team athletes, including professional volleyball player Wilawan Aphinyaphong and the 2004 Olympic gold medallist weightlifter Pawina Thongsuk.\nPubat president Suwich Rungwattanapaiboon.\nReflecting on her passion for reading, Wilawan shared: \"Reading has been a lifelong passion, offering solace and entertainment, especially during travels. As a business owner now, insights from books on tactics and business management prove invaluable.\"\nPawina, reminiscing about her childhood love for comics, highlighted the role of reading in fostering focus and knowledge. \"From Thai cartoons to translated fiction, reading has expanded my horizons and instilled discipline,\" she remarked\nThe convergence of literary enthusiasts, industry stalwarts and global perspectives at the 52nd National Book Fair and the 22nd Bangkok International Book Fair promises an immersive experience, underscoring Thailand's commitment to fostering a culture of reading and intellectual exchange on the global stage.\nThe 52nd National Book Fair and 22nd Bangkok International Book Fair runs from tomorrow to April 8 from 10am to 9pm at Hall 5-7, LG Floor, Queen Sirikit National Convention Center.

(Photo: Royal Thai Army)\nFor decades, the United States' positioning in the international arena has been a battle between the desire to remain isolated within the confines of its own territory and the urge to extend beyond its boundaries to induce and cajole others on the values and benefits of democracy, freedom and a free market.\nIn the former case, many in the United States feel comfortable and secure with their lives in the land of the bountiful, knowing that they are protected by two great oceans on its coasts and neighboured in the north and south by less endowed and rather innocuous countries. In such a situation, there exists a general feeling that the United States should go about its own affairs, be content with itself and disassociate from the affairs of others, as no harm could ever come to the shores of the United States.\nOn the other hand, many Americans also believe that the United States has a moral obligation to help the world and ensure that all can live in peace and prosperity. Some in the United States even contend that the country should not be complacent and wait for challenges and threats to occur but instead be proactive in its approach towards installing the values that they hold so dear. They believe that it is better to establish a series of forward defence lines while ensuring that the United States' ships and aeroplanes could always roam freely in the high seas and skies.\nADVERTISEMENT\nAs there are arguments to be made and examples to be referenced supporting and decrying each side of the issue, it would seem wise that the superpower moves forward, taking a more central approach which does not veer towards the extreme in either direction. It would be impractical and dangerous to suggest that the United States should completely extricate itself from the geopolitical scene and take a hands-off approach to the world at large. It is just the way of the world that some situations call for global powers to intervene for the greater good. However, what type of intervention occurs should be carefully deliberated, as it is of the utmost importance that diplomacy and dialogue are balanced with the need for military intervention.\nRELATED\nworld\nTrump returns to world stage at Notre-Dame reopening\nbusiness\nKorean turmoil dents equity trading sentiment\nThe United States entered the First World War to prevent the rising imperial Germany from successfully establishing its dominance over Europe and adjacent areas. However, it then withdrew inward, as it was not ready to play the role of a global guardian by choosing to forgo participation in the League of Nations. After the Second World War, which the United States entered to oppose the global threat of German fascism, they immediately accepted such a global position, taking a forward approach to the world and leading the opposition against the expansion of communism.\nThe United States became the supreme global power after the destruction of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of the Soviet Union and its leadership of communism. The world began to embrace and accept democracy and capitalist globalisation, but there was discontentment in both the United States and the world at large that had to do with the rapidly expanding concentration of wealth and power, the inequality between the haves and have-nots and the erosion of cultural identities, traditional values, self-respect and self-confidence. All are issues that have led to anti-globalisation sentiments and movements, which are further compounded by the decades of forced regime changes and the countless atrocities that coincided with them, which were all initiated and imposed by the United States and its allies in the name of anti-communism. The United States lost many wars, not because of its military weakness, but because it lacked the understanding and appreciation of the force of nationalism and human dignity among those who interpreted the United States' purportedly well-meaning and good-intended actions as an outright immoral intervention and imposition of view. The latest episode was the humiliating departure of the United States forces from Afghanistan, which started under former president Donald Trump, whose promotion of \"America first\" and constant complaints about the security arrangement of alliances reflected his position and isolationist thinking and posturing. The current President Joe Biden offers a return to the idea of \"Manifest Destiny\", the idea of the \"white man's burden\", and the forward defence concept.\nThese two juxtapositions have once again taken over American debates, namely moving forward with a policy of isolationism or internationalism that incorporates interventionism. As the United States is a global power with corresponding interests, which the international community depends on as a guarantor of peace, security and common prosperity, its decision moving forward will have far-reaching and long-lasting consequences. Interdependency and connectivity have dictated that the international community must live and work together.\nTaking the middle path would strike a perfect balance between promoting the betterment of the world while still serving the interests of the American people. The key change, however, is that it would require the United States to stop and listen before isolating and intervening. They would be a mediator instead of acting as the global policeman. With such a change, they would still support their longtime friends and allies, but in a strategic manner instead of a militaristic one. Providing assistance in ways that go beyond helping the military would promote security throughout the world and also gain the truly genuine backing of the citizens.\nAn obvious example of where such a policy would be immediately beneficial is in Southeast Asia. China is an autocratic behemoth that has been successfully expanding its influence throughout the region and world. Instead of focusing solely on increasing its militaristic support of countries like the Philippines and Vietnam, the United States could counter China with greater soft-power support. If, for example, they helped countries in the region improve their education systems and helped build growing industries, said countries would not only potentially develop to the point of being able to counter China's influence on their own but their positive ties to the United States would actually be seen by the civilian populations, instead of only by their semi-authoritarian leaders and the military-industrial complex. If the United States were to present countries in the region a reason to move forward with them, beyond merely saying that they should not move forward with their neighbour China and supporting their militaries, they are likely to have much more success.\nThe countries that maintain a stronger position in the world share a greater responsibility and that is the reason why there is the United Nations Security Council, permanently composed of the United States, Russia, China, the United Kingdom and France. The United States thus owes a legal obligation, as well as an international mandate, to serve the world at large. That said, the United States also has an obligation to its own citizens, and thus, a careful balancing of domestic interests and international involvement must occur. In other words, the United States should take the principle of the middle path to simultaneously handle its foreign policy and its domestic policy through the strengthening of its prosperity and stability at home, as well as strengthening its friendship and cooperation with friends abroad.\nKasit Piromya\nAPHR Board Member\nKasit Piromya is a Board Member of Asean Parliamentarians for Human Rights (APHR), and is a former Thai foreign minister.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat type of condominium are you most interested in?\nStudio\n1-bedroom\n2-bedroom\n3-bedroom\nPenthouse\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nUS foreign policy\nDo you like the content of this article?\n20\n15\nCOMMENT\n(40)",

The best way to preserve the status quo is to destroy the machinery that promises a change to existing ways.\nThat was the thinking of the Luddites, a movement of textile workers in early 19th-century England. Discomfited by the trade embargoes and financial crisis of the Napoleonic wars, they smashed up powered looms and weaving frames, hoping to slow the tide of innovation they saw as undercutting their livelihoods.\nIt's an example with worrying parallels to the present. China's widening lead in clean technology, coupled with its vast trade surplus and Beijing's desire to export its way out of a domestic slump, are combining with faltering efforts on decarbonisation in developed countries to produce a toxic mix.\nADVERTISEMENT\nIf green technology such as electric vehicles, solar panels and home batteries gets badged as foreign and threatening and finds itself excluded via laws and tariff policies, then drastically falling costs aren't going to be enough to get it into the hands of consumers. Spurious national security and industrial policy concerns will be sufficient to banish it.\nRELATED\nlife\nHorror show\nworld\nVolkswagen says next generation of combustion engine cars to be its last\nWe're already seeing evidence of this on multiple continents. Local content requirements and tariff barriers on solar panels, designed to build up domestic manufacturing industries, have operated in many places (including India, the US, South Africa, and Indonesia) as soft bans that have pushed up costs, slowed deployments, and favoured incumbent fossil-fired power generation and emissions.\nThe European Union, which doesn't impose tariffs on photovoltaic imports, installed nearly twice as much solar last year as the US and more than seven times as much as India, despite weather that's far less suited for the technology.\nElectric vehicles look like being the next front in this conflict. China's shift from one of the world's biggest car importers to among its biggest exporters has troubled its trading partners. Most of the export drive to date has come from conventional automobiles, but China's innovative technological edge in EVs has put electric models in the spotlight.\nSo far, the outrage has been fairly muted. Tariffs of 25% imposed under the Trump administration mean that few Chinese vehicles appear on US roads anyway, and in Europe, they're still not a dominant presence. Nonetheless, Brussels last October announced an investigation into whether Chinese cars had benefited from unfair subsidies, and the White House last month started an inquiry into Chinese technology in \"connected vehicles\", a category that sweeps in electric cars as well as many conventional ones.\nWith European and US automakers slowing their decarbonisation targets and slumping prices for battery metals likely to push Chinese EVs well below the cost of conventional cars, the perceived threat of cheaper, cleaner, better imported automobiles will only grow.\n\"Imagine if there were thousands or hundreds of thousands of Chinese-connected vehicles on American roads that could be immediately and simultaneously disabled by somebody in Beijing,\" US Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said in February.\nThat Red Dawn scenario seems weirdly fixated on cars, when you consider about 60% of the sensor-packed mobile phones the US imported over the past decade were made in China, rising to about 90% when if you include those produced in Mexico and Southeast Asian countries that are typically used as backdoor trade routes.\nThis trajectory could grow a good deal darker if elections this year replace the centrist administrations of presidents Ursula von der Leyen in Brussels and Joe Biden in Washington with more nativist and protectionist politicians. As we've seen in Japan, South Africa and India, minor tweaks to obscure regulations can be remarkably effective at stopping clean technology in its tracks.\nThat suggests there's still scope for right-wing populists to try out more draconian anti-green legislation than the largely rhetorical opposition practised by the Trump administration and UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak.\nBoth sides of the trade conflict can do things to avert this fate.\nDeveloped countries need to clear red tape standing in the way of their ambitious decarbonisation plans and offer further support for green technology demand. Manufacturers quite reasonably suspect that decarbonisation targets will be abandoned when the going gets tough, so don't invest as aggressively as Chinese competitors, convinced they have the state's backing. The result is ever-growing Chinese dominance.\nThey also need to remember that what they have right now is not energy security. Ms Raimondo's nightmare vision of foreign authoritarians playing havoc with transport networks doesn't need secret kill switches.\nPetroleum exporters already have enough sway in energy markets to raise costs on industries and households to devastating levels. Beijing can't stop the sun from shining on Chinese-made solar panels in Germany -- but Moscow really did cut the flow of gas to Europe.\nChina, for its part, needs to recognise that it can't export its way out of its current economic troubles -- and that attempts to do so will only accelerate the protectionist currents growing stronger by the day in its trading partners. A push toward more household consumption, rather than another export boom, is the best way to rebalance its economy.\nTo confront the common global challenge of a warming planet, every part of the world needs to work in unison. An acceleration in trade wars will only slow our path to zero.\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg\nDavid Fickling is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering energy and commodities.

(Photo: Ministry of Tourism and Sports)\n\"The government has attached [great] importance to several policies. Tourism is one of the flagship policies,'' said Mr Srettha, who also serves as finance minister.\nThe government is improving the ease of travel for foreign tourists, with examples being the temporary visa exemptions granted to visitors from India, Russia, Kazakhstan, and Taiwan, he said.\nAs part of such efforts, Thailand and China also signed a reciprocal visa exemption agreement, which came into effect on March 1.\nThe government is likewise pushing to reach visa-free travel arrangement deals with European states in the Schengen area.\n\"The visa-free travel deal with the Schengen states is not just a dream,\" the prime minister said.\nMr Srettha also stressed the need to improve infrastructure and upgrade immigration control systems to prepare for international visitors.\n\"We have to make sure they are impressed from the moment they set foot in Thailand until they leave the country,\" he said.\nThe prime minister also said that during his recent trip to Germany and France, he met with Formula E executives who expressed interest in Thailand as a potential site for hosting a Formula E electric-car racing championship series.\nHe said Formula E executives would come to explore an area in Chiang Mai next week to study the feasibility of holding a Formula E competition in Thailand for the first time. That would help promote Thailand as a regional tourism hub, he said.\nFormula E is officially known as the ABB FIA Formula E World Championship. It was launched in Beijing in 2014 and later earned the FIA world championship status.\nThe premier previously said Thailand was making a shift towards using EV cars, with them accounting for 40% of total car orders made since the end of last year.\nMr Srettha said the government is making the most of Thailand's cultural heritage or \"soft power\".\n\"This brainstorming session will not end up like a firework fizzling out. It should be used as a platform for a further push for tourism alongside infrastructure development. Next year will be the biggest year for tourism, but we will have to begin later this year. But first, we also need six months to prepare,\" Mr Srettha said.\n\"Thailand will host cultural and sports events, concerts, Formula E, world food festivals and much more,\" he said.\nMr Srettha also said the government is working with retail business operators from Central Group, Siam Piwat, the Mall Group and King Power to promote products made by local communities under an initiative called \"Thainess Station: Thai Products Unify Thai Communities\".\nThai handicrafts, including pha khao ma or Thai loincloth, basketry from kra jood or bulrush and indigo-dyed fabric are now being sold at shopping malls like IconSiam and King Power's retail outlets at all Thai international airports until April 30.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat is your budget range for renting a condominium?\nUnder 10,000 THB/month\n10,000 - 20,000 THB/month\n20,000 - 40,000 THB/month\n40,000 - 60,000 THB/month\nOver 60,000 THB/month\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nThailand\nTourism\nTravel\nTrip\nDo you like the content of this article?\n5\n81\nCOMMENT\n(14)",

Most of this group was in the Bangkok metropolitan area and tended to buy pricey, non-food items such as electrical appliances, he said.\nADVERTISEMENT\nConsumers are awaiting additional stimulus measures or government spending to lift their confidence in making purchases, he said.\nMr Chatchai said he expects the retail segment to accelerate in the third quarter as budget spending gears up, contributing to overall retail growth of 3% in 2024, aligning with the GDP growth forecast.\nRELATED\nbusiness\nSET eases from 1,500 as momentum slows\nthailand\nRattan Meets Watchmaking: Art Transforms Luxury Retail\nHowever, he said some issues continue to hamper the sector and its supply chain, such as a high non-performing loan outlook and rising living costs, which drag down consumer spending power, especially among the middle and low-income classes.\nThe non-food segment is expected to grow slower than the food segment, given higher prices and larger purchases, coupled with the former being non-essential purchases, according to the association.\nAlthough there are 8-10 million consumers in the upper middle class with strong spending power, they might not spend as much as expected unless the government regains their confidence through investment and incentives, said Mr Chatchai.\n\"The government continues to push large-scale development projects like the Land Bridge and high-speed railway connecting three airports, but there has been no tangible outcome thus far that would revive consumer confidence in higher spending,\" he said.\nTourists shop at Siam Paragon mall in Bangkok. Kasikorn Research Center estimates Thai retail sales in 2024 to expand by 3% to 4.1 trillion baht.\u2009Wichan Charoenkiatpakul\nSPENDING BOOST\nMr Chatchai suggested short-term initiatives to drive high-spending consumers, such as transforming Phuket into a tax-free shopping destination to attract high-value buyers. This segment would be more likely to buy local, especially if a domestic tourism incentive was offered, he said.\nTo enhance foreign tourist spending, the focus should be on prolonged stays and developing high-quality products, said Mr Chatchai. Leveraging soft power policies, such as promoting festivals and local culture, serve as positive examples to increase expenditure.\nRegarding the influx of cheap Chinese goods, he said this phenomenon emerged many years ago with globalisation and should not affect the retail sector as significantly as the industrial and manufacturing sectors because retail is at the end of the supply chain.\nGiven fast-paced technology and shorter product life cycles, consumers naturally gravitate towards affordable products, be it electrical appliances or clothing, said Mr Chatchai.\nTo strengthen the nation's manufacturing supply chain and enhance competitiveness, he suggested the government consider regulating free trade zones and reassess value-added tax (VAT) exemptions for online purchases of less than 1,500 baht to deter the influx of illegal, low-cost foreign goods.\nTax and tariff waivers are major factors contributing to the wave of Chinese products entering the country, said Mr Chatchai.\nThailand waived the import duty and VAT on imported parcels with combined price and cost, insurance and freight fees of no more than 1,500 baht per piece. The price was set at 1,000 baht in 2018 before the recent hike.\nEvery year more than 30 million parcels are shipped into Thailand, of which half importers claim the item price is lower than 1,500 baht.\nAccording to the Federation of Thai Industries, up to 20 industrial sectors, including steel, aluminium, plastics, ceramics, petrochemicals and medicine, are struggling to deal with tougher competition, with small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) the most affected.\nSanan Angubolkul, chairman of the Thai Chamber of Commerce, said China is a major global manufacturing hub with ample raw materials and developed supply chains, leading to low production costs and cheaper products. Coupled with the boom in e-commerce, an influx of cheap Chinese products is flooding the Thai market, he said.\n\"Companies have expressed concern regarding this influx into both Thai and Southeast Asian markets as it further compounds the challenges faced by local SMEs,\" said Mr Sanan.\nHe said certain imported products such as electrical appliances could cause problems because they may lack certification based on Thai industrial standards. Insufficient staff to carry out rigorous inspections also creates a challenge when handling a large volume of imports, said Mr Sanan.\nConsumers walk past decorations for Chinese New Year at CentralWorld mall on Feb 7, 2024.\u2009Pattarapong Chatpattarasill\nWARNING ISSUED\nKasikorn Research Center (K-Research) forecast retail sales to expand by 3% this year to 4.1 trillion baht.\nAccording to the research unit, consumer product retail sales grew by 5% in 2023, 7% in 2022 and 1.3% in 2021, after contracting 0.6% in 2020. In 2019, the market grew 4.6%.\nGrowth this year is expected to be driven largely by foreign tourist spending and higher prices for certain items, particularly food and personal goods, noted the think tank.\nHowever, K-Research warned local manufacturers will likely face intense competition from imported goods, especially from China.\nLast year Thailand imported consumer goods worth 470 billion baht from China, up 2.8% year-on-year, accounting for 41% of total imported consumer goods.\nChinese imports include both daily necessities and electrical appliances, constituting 43.3% of the value of consumer goods imported from China, followed by fresh and processed fruit and vegetables (10%), clothing and footwear (9.3%) and household appliances and decorations at (9.1%).\nAccording to K-Research, Chinese consumer goods pressure the competitiveness of Thai manufacturers, especially for fashion items (shoes and bags), and fresh and processed fruit and vegetables.\nThe influx of Chinese products has diminished the production capacity of non-food consumer goods, said the think tank, particularly for fashion (shoes, clothing and accessories) and furniture, where the production capacity utilisation rate is at 30-45%.\nK-Research concluded the flood of imported Chinese goods presents a significant challenge for Thai manufacturers.\nConsumers select canned food at a Big C hypermarket in Bangkok. Consumers are currently awaiting additional stimulus measures or government spending to boost their confidence in making purchases, Mr Chatchai said. Nutthawat Wicheanbut\nFOOD HIT HARD\nThaniwan Kulmongkol, president of the Thai Restaurant Association, said the influx of cheap food ingredients from China also disrupted the domestic market, posing a threat to the competitiveness of local farmers.\nMs Thaniwan said the majority of Chinese imports consist of agricultural products, particularly vegetables and fruit such as grapes, red onions and garlic.\nFor instance, imported garlic costs around 40 baht per kilogramme, significantly lower than garlic from Si Sa Ket, a major Thai production area, which is priced 150-200 baht per kg.\nThis price difference has reduced the supply of locally grown produce, making Thai farmers less competitive, she said.\nSmall restaurants and street food vendors tend to rely on cheaper ingredients to manage costs, while larger restaurants and chain operators can afford to use authentic, higher-quality ingredients to maintain their service standards.\nMs Thaniwan emphasised the need for more coordinated efforts among responsible ministries to support the entire agricultural supply chain, from upstream production and sourcing to downstream selling and exports.\n\"As the government aims to elevate Thai cuisine as a soft power globally, it should focus on supporting the production of authentic ingredients,\" she said.\nMs Thaniwan cited the Tourism Authority of Thailand's World Kaphrao Thailand Grand Prix, where contestants are required to use local ingredients such as sweet basil and jasmine rice, as a good example. Such an event can promote this famous dish and increase exports of Thai ingredients worldwide, she said.\nKey Thai products can still compete in terms of quality and pricing for both export and domestic consumption, such as jasmine rice, raw chicken, shrimp and canned fish, said Ms Thaniwan.\nShe said the restaurant industry expects steady revenue growth this year as foreign tourist arrivals increase, forecast to reach 35-40 million this year.\nMs Thaniwan said foreign tourists still perceive Thailand as an affordable destination with a diverse array of food, ranging from street food to Michelin-recognised establishments.\nConversely, as domestic purchasing power weakens, locals may choose more affordable meals or street food to manage expenses, she said.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat type of house are you most interested in?\nSingle-family home\nTownhouse\nSemi-detached house\nVilla\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nRetail\nSector\nChina\nCheap\nProducts\nLiving\nCosts\nImport\nDo you like the content of this article?\n11\n15\nCOMMENT\n(4)",

(Photo: Chanat Katanyu)\nPrime Minister Srettha Thavisin announced his vision for Thailand's future recently. Dubbed \"Ignite Thailand\", the plan seeks to establish the country as the world-class hub for eight sectors, namely tourism, medical and wellness tourism, food and agriculture, aviation, logistics, future mobility, digital economy, as well as finance.\nThe vision was lauded by economic analysts, who said the government should continue to develop the nation's potential, and the plan could lead the way towards a more sustainable way out of the current economic slump.\nAccording to Nonarit Bisonyabut, senior economic researcher at Thailand Development Research Institute (TDRI), developing the country into a regional hub for businesses and industries can help Thailand escape the middle-income trap.\nADVERTISEMENT\n\"Thailand should find a way to general revenues in a more sustainable manner, as the country's main problem is low economic growth,\" he said.\nRELATED\nlife\nIgnite your curiosity at Singapore Writers Festival\nbusiness\nPundits evaluate affiliate marketing tie-up\nSET PRIORITIES\nHe urged state agencies to identify which areas need urgent attention, so officials can focus their efforts on the problems and direct resources more effectively.\n\"The budget for soft power promotion, for instance, will never be enough, as long as the government spends it only on organising events,\" he explained, urging the government to spend its budget more wisely.\nFor instance, the government might want to consider sparing part of the 500-billion-baht budget for the digital wallet scheme to help address some of the structural issues within the economy.\n\"If the government wants to promote the country as the logistic hub, it should forget the Land Bridge megaproject. It would save up several billion baht, which could be used to solve border issues and address weaknesses in our regulations,\" he added.\n\"We are already number 1 in the region in terms of tourism. As a wellness and medical hub, we are also price-competitive with Singapore, especially in surgery and childbirth.\n\"With our rich food culture and our status as a food exporter, Thailand could very well become a regional hub for agriculture and food -- we just need to focus on maintaining the quality,\" he said.\nPROBLEMS AND POTENTIAL\nThe researcher, however, pointed out the challenges faced by the other five industries.\nMr Nonarit said the opportunity to develop the country's potential as an aviation hub is gradually narrowing because of the stiff competition in the region.\nThe government planned to develop aircraft maintenance depots in U-tapao and Chiang Rai-Mae Fah Luang airports, but construction has been beset by delays since the Covid-19 pandemic.\nThailand is well-positioned to be a logistics hub because of its location at the centre of the Cambodia-Laos-Myanmar-Vietnam region, which is expected to grow rapidly in the next few years, but plans for a cross-country connection would only be viable as long as they linked to either India or China on one end.\n\"If we can connect to India and southern China, it would be a great advantage because there is a lot of demand,\" he said.\nHowever, the government is choosing to go with the Land Bridge mega-project, which Mr Nonarit said won't significantly reduce transit times like the Panama Canal and Egypt's Suez Canal.\nThailand also has the potential to become the future hub for foreign investment, he said, especially as China is facing numerous geopolitical problems.\nIn order to become a digital economy hub, the government should ask itself, whether or not it is ready to develop the country into a digital special economic zone, and really focus on start-up businesses.\nWhile it is impossible for Thailand to compete with Hong Kong and Singapore as a global financial hub in the next couple of years, the country can still be a hub for regional investments, especially for companies and projects based in the CLMV region, he said.\nGiven those limitations, he urged the government to concentrate on its areas of expertise, namely tourism and food.\nNonarit: Govt needs to focus\nIsares Rattanadilok Na Phuket, vice-chairman of the Federation of Thai Industries (FTI), said he was delighted to hear the government is finally concentrating on the key issue affecting the country.\n\"I want to see the government work with the private sector, the way the Joint Public and Private Sector Consultative Committee (JPPSCC) did, to ensure every effort goes in the same direction,\" said Mr Isares.\nIf the government has set a clear direction, the private sector will then be able to help the country to compete with its neighbouring countries, Mr Isares said. \"I think the government is starting to see the country must have better infrastructure to accommodate both tourists and advanced industries,\" he said.\nImprovements to the country's railway system can improve connections to Laos via Thanaleng railway station, and onwards to southern China and beyond. However, private companies are often deterred from investing due to the abundance of red-tape. As such, he urged the government ease the regulations to facilitate private sector involvement. \"The advantage of this government is that the prime minister came from the private sector, so he understands what it wants,\" he added.\nIsares: Time to set clear goals\nThe Dream\nOn the other hand, Varakorn Samakoses, economic and finance expert and president of Dhurakij Pundit University, disagreed with the hub development plan saying the concept of hubs is old-fashioned.\nThe hub development plan has been talked about for a long time, he said, adding the world today is more advanced than that. \"It might be the dream of the premier alone. I think the government should focus on short-term policies that are more suited to more current problems, before committing to hub development processes for another 20\u201330 years,\" said Mr Varakorn. \"The premier has a dream that he wants to make true, but his method is not based on reality. We barely hear other countries talk about hubs in this era.\"\nThailand, he said, has a lot of short-term problems that need to be fixed, that's why the government should review the plan to develop the eight hubs to see if it still lines up with the national development strategy. \"However, in these 2\u20133 years, the most important is to learn how to spend the budget efficiently and boost the quality of human resources,\" Mr Varakorn added.\nVarakorn: Hub dream outdated\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat type of accommodation do you usually prefer when traveling in Thailand?\nLuxury hotels (5-star)\nMid-range hotels (3-4 star)\nHostels and guesthouses\nPrivate rentals (Airbnb or villas)\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nIgnite\nThailand\nSrettha\nVision\nHub\nDo you like the content of this article?\n12\n65\nCOMMENT\n(56)",

(Photo: Somchai Poomlard)\nThailand is experiencing an influx of foreign visitors as the government's visa-free policy for tourists from countries including China has given the industry a much-needed boost.\nHowever, business operators have called on the government to devise measures to address shortages of skilled labourers in the industry, improve transport infrastructure in provinces that are also major tourist spots, as well as deal with criminals exploiting the visa-exemption policy to enter the country and run illegal businesses.\nThailand is currently allowing visitors from Kazakhstan and China to stay for 30 days visa-free until Feb 29.\nADVERTISEMENT\nOn Jan 28, Thailand and China signed an agreement on a reciprocal visa-free scheme that will take effect from March 1.\nUnder the agreement, holders of valid, ordinary Thai passports and Chinese holders of passports for public affairs and ordinary passports will be exempt from visa requirements when entering or transiting through the other country for up to 30 days.\nRELATED\nbusiness\nEconomic concerns poised to curb the domestic tourism market\nbusiness\nThailand's Eastern Economic Corridor to include Prachin Buri\nCumulative stays must not exceed 90 days in any 180-day period, except for the purposes of residing or engaging in employment, study, media activities or other activities that require prior approval.\nMeanwhile, Russian passport holders can stay in Thailand for 90 days until April 30, while Indian and Taiwanese tourists can also enjoy a 30-day stay until May 10.\nLast year, Thailand drew about 28 million foreign tourists and 1.2 trillion baht in revenue, well short of the record of almost 40 million arrivals and 1.9 trillion baht in revenue in 2019 or before the Covid-19 pandemic, according to the Tourism and Sports Ministry.\nThe Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT) said Malaysians made up the largest group of visitors to Thailand, with around 4.5 million visitors last year while Chinese tourists formed the second-largest group with about 3.51 million visitors.\nBut as of Feb 1, Chinese travellers tallied more than 533,000 this year, followed by arrivals from Malaysia at more than 337,000 and South Korea at more than 229,000.\nThe Chinese comprised the biggest group of visitors in pre-pandemic 2019, with about 11 million.\nThe Tourism and Sports Ministry is confident the country can attract 35 million foreign visitors this year after 3 million arrived in January.\nSeasonality factor\nAccording to the Kasikorn Research Centre, a subsidiary of KBank, the Chinese formed the biggest group of tourists visiting Thailand last month due to several factors, including a seasonality factor as Chinese travellers often go on holidays toward the end of the year or soon after for Chinese New Year, which fell on Feb 10 this year.\nAnother factor is Thailand's visa-exemption measure for Chinese tourists, which started on Sept 25 last year.\nAccording to the research centre, China is expected to become Thailand's top source of foreign arrivals by the end of this year, with an estimated 5.2 million arrivals.\nThis is because the momentum of Chinese tourists visiting Thailand is expected to continue to gather pace this year.\nHowever, the return of Chinese tourists may take a while as economic challenges in China deter Chinese from travelling abroad while travel costs remain high, especially for those with relatively low incomes, according to the centre.\nSurawat Akaraworamat, vice-presi\u00ad- dent of the Tourism Council of Thailand, told the Bangkok Post that Chinese tourists have entered Thailand visa-free since September last year.\nSo, the reciprocal visa-free scheme that will take effect from March 1 should not lead to any further significant increase in Chinese arrivals. Instead, the number of Thais visiting China is expected to increase, he said.\nMr Surawat said that due to China's economic problems this year's Chinese visitors are markedly different to those who came back in 2019.\n\"This year we have a decrease in group tours from China but the number of Chinese travelling independently without being a part of a tour group is increasing. So, operators in the hospitality industry must adjust their approaches to respond to the trend,'' he said.\nHe also said Thailand's visa-free policy may also prompt Chinese businesses to invest in Thailand's tourism industry using Thai nominees, which will enable them to compete with local business operators. \"Even though Thailand has laws in place to deal with Thais acting as nominees on behalf of foreigners, the problem is that law enforcers do not measure up. This area [law enforcement] needs to be improved,'' he said.\nTourist safety\nHe also stressed the need for the government to devise measures to ensure foreign visitors' safety.\nLaws that belong to the Tourism and Sport Ministry and deal directly with tourism are few and far between, he said, adding that most of the laws belong to other ministries, such as the Public Health Ministry, the Transport Ministry and the Interior Ministry.\n\"There should be a law that is designed specifically to ensure foreign tourists' safety,'' he said. \"Moreover, if the government wants to use Thai culture as soft power to attract international visitors, it should take the matter seriously. The private sector is already trying to promote the country's soft power,'' he said\n\"At least, the TAT should carry on with its campaign to promote cultural resources as categorised into 5Fs: food, film, fashion, fighting (Thai martial arts) and festivals,'' he said. Mr Surawat said the government should also focus on travellers from the Middle East as they are big spenders, often staying at four-or five-star hotels.\nSurawat: Chinese tourists coming since Sept 2023\nThaneth Tantipiriyakij, president of the Phuket Tourist Association, echoed the view that group tours from China are falling, compared to the increasing number of free independent travellers (FITs) from China.\nThese FIT travellers may not arrive in large numbers, but they stay longer and spend more at local businesses than group tour travellers, he said.\nMr Thaneth also said that after Thailand and China signed the agreement on the reciprocal visa-free scheme, about 370 direct flights from China to Phuket have been booked for this month, with an expected surge of free independent travellers from China.\nCalls for govt help\nMr Thaneth also urged the government to hold talks with both domestic and international airline operators to increase flights to the island province and expand Phuket airport's capacity to handle more passengers in the future.\nHe also wanted the government to improve road access to Phuket, as there is currently only one road, while the private sector and local bodies in Phuket should be granted licences to operate public transport systems. Utilities such as water, electricity and wastewater treatment, should also be improved to handle a surge of tourists, he said.\nThaneth: Group tours from China are falling\nBhunanan Patanasin, president of the Pattaya Business and Tourism Association, hailed the visa-free policy, saying it has already attracted more Chinese tourists to Pattaya. He also said that most Chinese visitors travel on their own and are not part of any tour group. They stay at four-and five-star hotels and spend more than group tour travellers.\nHe also called on the government to develop measures to address problems affecting tourism in Pattaya, including shortages of skilled workers and a lack of intra-city and inter-provincial transport systems.\nRoad surfaces there should also be improved to ensure road safety and make it easy for visitors to travel, while the government should also push for more direct flights to U-Tapao airport to bring in more tourists to Pattaya and other nearby provinces in eastern Thailand.\nBhunanan: Huge increase in tours to Pattaya\nHi-tech to tackle crime\nPol Lt Gen Jirabhop Bhuridej, commissioner of the Central Investigation Bureau (CIB), told the Bangkok Post he was concerned that some criminals will exploit the visa-free policy to enter Thailand and operate illegal businesses here.\n\"Urgent measures must be devised to deal with various crimes systematically,\" and he said that looking after the safety of foreign visitors and Thai people is also a priority. \"Thailand will not be an easy place for criminals. The police will do all they can to make life difficult for them. We will crack down on them.\"\nHe admitted that conventional approaches, such as street patrols, may not be enough to deal with some crimes. Modern technologies have been brought in to support immigration control and investigate the backgrounds of suspects arriving in Thailand. Long-distance high-speed thermal imaging cameras have also been installed along the border to detect foreigners who enter the country illegally via natural channels, Pol Lt Gen Jirabhop said.\nHe said the CIB has worked with Chinese authorities to combat Chinese criminals who pretend to be tourists and run illegal businesses here. \"Thailand will not be a paradise for transnational criminal syndicates. Thais must not support illegal foreign businesses by acting as nominees,\" he said.\nJirabhop: Criminals may exploit visa-free policy\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat type of accommodation do you usually prefer when traveling in Thailand?\nLuxury hotels (5-star)\nMid-range hotels (3-4 star)\nHostels and guesthouses\nPrivate rentals (Airbnb or villas)\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nVisa\nFee\nWaiver\nTourists\nVisitors\nArrivals\nCriminal\nCrime\nDo you like the content of this article?\n18\n262\nCOMMENT\n(41)",

Across the Asean region, HSBC has also been honoured as the \"Best International Bank\" in five of the six Asean countries in which it operates, namely Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, the Philippines and Vietnam.\nADVERTISEMENT\nIn addition, HSBC Thailand has earned further 9 accolades such as Thailand's \"Best Service Provider for Transaction Banking\" and Thailand's \"Best Service Provider for Trade Finance\" from the Asset Triple A Awards 2024. These awards, many of which have been won consecutively over several years, highlight HSBC's deep roots and solid expertise in the Thai market as the country\u2019s first bank since 1888.\nInternational Connectivity\nWith a strong global network across 60 countries, HSBC empowers its local branch to support Thai businesses, particularly in cross-border banking services, where the bank holds a significant advantage.\nRELATED\nworld\nSingapore oil tycoon OK Lim sentenced to 17 years in jail\nbusiness\nScandal stalks stocks\nAs one of the largest financial institutions in the world, HSBC facilitates cross-border investments on a global scale, helping clients connect business flows across major trade corridors where the bank maintains an active presence.\nHSBC\u2019s international connectivity, combined with its extensive expertise, breadth, and perspective, uniquely positions the bank to unlock new opportunities for both Thai and foreign clients.\nMr Gamba emphasised that HSBC Thailand has leveraged the strengths and advantages of its parent company to support all customer segments, including multinational firms, large Thai corporations, and medium-sized businesses. At the same time, HSBC Thailand is committed to meeting the needs of all customer segments through its comprehensive financial solutions.\nHSBC Thailand\u2019s cross-border banking and related financial services have been specifically designed to facilitate both inbound and outbound investments for its clients. &nbsp;\nHSBC Thailand supports Thai businesses in expanding into 41 countries.\n\"On average, we assist each local customer in expanding their business to three different countries. We also have two Thai clients with operations in over 20 countries globally,\" noted Mr Gamba.\nDespite these achievements, HSBC remains focused on continually developing innovative financial products and services to fully support its clients. The bank is also committed to strengthening collaboration with both the public and private sector to facilitate local business growth and contribute to the Thai economy.\nStrategic Partnership with the BOI\nAccording to Mr Gamba, HSBC Thailand has also signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the Board of Investment (BOI) to support Thailand\u2019s inward and outward foreign direct investment (FDI) flows. This partnership aims to leverage HSBC\u2019s international network, spanning 60 countries, to capture global FDI opportunities for Thailand.\nThrough this cooperation, HSBC Thailand will assist the BOI in promoting Thailand as a key investment hub in Southeast Asia. The bank will also support international investment roadshows to showcase Thailand's potential to global investors.\n\u201cOur role in this partnership is to support the BOI on international investment roadshows to showcase Thailand\u2019s potentials to the world. We aim to work with the BOI to develop new trade and investment corridors where HSBC has a presence, particularly the United Kingdom, Mainland China, Hong Kong, India, Saudi Arabia, ASEAN, and Europe,\u201d Mr. Gamba added.\nThailand has long been a key manufacturing hub in the region and remains a vital component of many global supply chains. This strategic position continues to make the country an attractive destination for large-scale investments from both Asean countries and global markets.\n\u201cAs a regional manufacturing powerhouse, Thailand is quite strong and attractive for FDI in several industries, especially the auto industry. Thailand stands to gain significantly from the global growth of electric vehicles [EVs], especially from Chinese manufacturers, positioning the country to become a key player in this sector.\u201d\nThailand continues to be a vital market for international corporations and a prime destination for FDI. Additionally, HSBC Thailand is focused on facilitating investments in strategic sectors where Thailand possesses a distinct competitive advantage, Mr. Gamba said.\nAccording to Mr Gamba, HSBC\u2019s country strategy aligns with Thailand\u2019s national plan, particularly in sectors such as EVs, digital innovation, and environmental, social, and governance (ESG) initiatives. The bank\u2019s key international clients from China, intra-Asean, and the US are also following Thailand\u2019s FDI trends.\nDigital Banking&nbsp;\nThe development of digital banking is another crucial area for supporting business growth in Thailand. HSBC has launched HSBC UniTransact, an innovative digital solution designed to streamline cross-border transactions with enhanced speed, cost efficiency and transparency.\nSince its introduction in 2022, HSBC Thailand has seen a remarkable 34% increase in cross-border payment turnover, along with a substantial 27% rise in the number of cross-border transactions.\nMoreover, HSBC ranks as the global leader in digital payments and is investing an additional US$2 billion in digital banking transformation. The institution processes over 4 billion transactions annually, totaling around $600 trillion.\nGlobal Private Banking\nAs a leading international bank in Thailand, HSBC has long provided financial services to both local and global businesses. While large corporations and multinational firms have traditionally formed the core of the bank\u2019s customer base, HSBC Thailand is increasingly expanding its Global Private Banking business to support the ambitions of Thai HNWI and UHNWI to manage, grow, and preserve their wealth legacy for generations to come.&nbsp;\nHSBC Global Private Banking ranks among one of Asia\u2019s largest private banks with an extensive regional footprint. It operates in over 40 markets and 13 strategic booking centres across the globe. This makes us stand out against competition to offer global wealth and mobility solutions to our clients. Our Global Private Banking in Thailand is the 2nd onshore location in Southeast Asia, bringing access to a wide range of sophisticated wealth product into the local market.\nConfidence in Thailand\n\"We are committed to growing our business, expanding our client base, investing in Thailand, and helping our clients connect with regional and global opportunities to invest and grow,\" said Mr Gamba.\n\"We will work closely with the government to shape industrial policy and create client opportunities.

The event brought together experts from various fields to share insights and visions about Thailand's economic landscape, future trends and how Thai organisations should prepare to cope with coming challenges. The forum attracted over a hundred leading businessmen. Participants gained access to the latest information on business-related laws, taxes and technologies fostering dialogue and networking opportunities among entrepreneurs, investors and specialists across diverse sectors.&nbsp;\nMr. Rob Hurenkamp\nMr. Rob Hurenkamp\n, Managing Partner of Forvis Mazars in Thailand,\nopened the forum by emphasising the significant challenges facing Thai organisations in a rapidly evolving global environment. \"This forum serves as a critical platform to provide our clients and partners with insights and knowledge about economic trends and various changes, including tax laws that will impact business operations in Thailand, both for Thai companies and Thai individuals operating internationally. There are numerous challenging factors that organisations need to be fully prepared to address.\"\nDr Arnunchanog Sukondhavat, Director of the Macroeconomic Strategy and Planning Division at the National Economic and Social Development Council (NESDC),\nexplained the factors influencing the future economy. These include shifts in political power dynamics, the implementation of various regulatory policies that can impact economic stability and uncertainty, changes in trade regulations and technological advancements. Particularly the Artificial Intelligence (AI), the Internet of Things (IoT), and blockchain, which must be leveraged to maintain competitiveness. These advancements present both opportunities and risks that require careful consideration.&nbsp; Additionally, the issue of sustainability is crucial, and Thailand must adapt to climate change and resource scarcity by adopting sustainable practices in future business operations.\nForvis Mazars'\nconsulting team\nand experts presented at the forum include:\nOutsourcing Partner Mr. Jonathan Fryer, Legal Partner Mr. Chatchawat Kriengsuntikul, Tax Partner Mr. Jonathan Stuart-Smith, Financial Advisory Partner Mr. Prasenjit Chakraborty, Audit Partner Ms. Tippawan Pumbansao, along with other top executives in Thailand.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\nMr. Chatchawat Kriengsuntikul, the Legal Partner\noffered insights into the legal perspectives of global challenges facing Thailand. Key trends impacting Thai laws and regulations include the shifting economic landscape which is influencing Thailand-China trade development. The enforcement of the Draft Climate Change Act will significantly affect the country's greenhouse gas emissions and business operation costs. The draft Electronic Transaction Act aims to modernise the legal framework for digital transactions. Organisations should proactively plan their tax strategies to minimise expenses.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\nMr. Jonathan Fryer, Outsourcing Partner,\nsaid the next trend is Autonomous Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents, which can make significant decisions autonomously without human intervention. AI can help organisations reduce costs, enhance transactional efficiency, analyse financial data for crucial decision-making, identify market trends and opportunities and effectively set business direction.&nbsp;\nMs. Tippawan Pumbansao (centre)\nAccording to Audit Partner Ms.Tippawan Pumbansao, another crucial area for organisations to focus on is navigating climate change and resource scarcity and refining their ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) reporting practices. Compliance with environmental and new economic policies is crucial to maintaining competitiveness in both domestic and international markets.&nbsp; Transparency in sustainability reporting is increasingly important and must be subject to rigorous audits, similar to financial reports to meet sustainability auditing standards.&nbsp; &nbsp;\n\"These factors highlight the significant challenges facing Thai organisations in a rapidly changing global landscape.

This is to reduce the effects of global demand fragility on Asean's growth potential.\nFurthermore, Asean should conclude negotiations on the upgraded Asean Trade in Goods Agreement in 2025 to maximise the effective utilisation of the advantages of regional integration.\nThe meeting also pushed for accelerating the completion of Asean's Digital Economy Framework Agreement negotiations, aiming to reach the target of 50% of negotiations in 2024.\nThe AEC Council met to discuss the progress and outcomes of various AEC initiatives in 2024 under the Asean Economic Pillar, which include the negotiations on the upgraded Asean-China Free Trade Agreement, preparation of the report on the revision of the Asean Framework Agreement on Intellectual Property Rights Cooperation, and the establishment of Asean-wide unique business identification numbers.\nAfter 2025, it must strive to strengthen its position in embracing sustainability and climate response, building a digitally resilient Asean, and ensuring the centrality of inclusivity in its initiatives, particularly for micro, small and medium-sized enterprises to ensure that no one is left behind and to narrow the development gap.\nThe meeting discussed the way forward in crafting the AEC Strategic Plan to implement the Asean Community Vision 2045 before presenting to the 44th and 45th Asean Summits on Oct 9-11.\nThe council ministers approved and endorsed documents for economic deliverables, which are forwarded to be endorsed by Asean leaders at the Asean Summits on Wednesday.\nThese include the Asean Leaders' Declaration on Enhancing Supply Chains Connectivity, Vientiane Declaration on Narrowing the Development Gap in Asean and Regional Guidelines for Sustainable Agriculture in Asean.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhich app or platform do you usually use to book accommodations?\nBooking.com\nAgoda\nAirbnb\nTrip.com\nTraveloka\nExpedia\nSkyscanner\nDirectly with the accommodation\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nAsean Summit\nTrade\nCommerce\nTalk\nDo you like the content of this article?\n0\n0\nCOMMENT",

I personally believe that the SET is not less attractive than other regional bourses as the continued recovery of the tourism sector and additional economic stimulus to be launched by the government will drive the SET index to finish at 1,470 points by the year end,\" she said.\nADVERTISEMENT\nVAYU1 has received strong interest from investors since its inception, having been able to mobilise 130 billion baht from institutional investors and 20 billion baht from retail investors. The fund began investing in Thai equities at the start of this month by focusing on stocks with good fundamentals, strong corporate governance, and the long-term value of the companies.\nCurrently, half of its investment portfolio is in SET50 stocks, 40% in government bonds, and the remainder in corporate debentures with a credit rating of A or higher, added Ms Chavinda.\nRELATED\nbusiness\nUnwinding the Dr Boon scandal\nbusiness\nSET lacks catalysts until year-end\nVAYU1 soared 1% in morning trade on Monday to finish at 10.10 baht by midday, outpacing the SET's 0.3% increase overall, with a trading value of 2.55 billion baht. The increase, however, lagged Pluk Phak Praw Rak Mae (OKJ), which debuted on the SET last Friday and jumped 10.4% to close at 13.7 baht by midday.\nApichart Phubancherdkul, head of strategy research at Tisco Securities, shared a similar view as Ms Chavinda, saying VAYU1 would help stabilise Thai stocks when the market is under a portfolio adjustment among foreign investors due to overseas factors.\n\"Foreign investors are now adjusting their portfolio after they gained a profit of nearly 20% due to the recent appreciation of the baht. Now, the Thai currency is depreciating as the dollar is now traded at a two-month high and the US bond yield is at 4% after stronger than expected employment data eased recession fears of the US economy,\" he pointed out.\nAlso, intensified tensions in the Middle East have prompted foreign capital outflows from emerging markets including Thailand, Mr Apichart added.\nAccording to Asia Plus Securities, foreigners were net sellers in Asian stock markets in the month to date, with outflows of US$2.5 billion from the Indian stock market, $877 million from Taiwan, $156 million from South Korea, $114 million from Indonesia, and $330 million or 11 billion baht from Thailand.\nFinance Minister Pichai Chunhavajira said VAYU1 has drawn significant interest from investors, demonstrating that trust and confidence have returned to the Thai stock market.\nHe believes that more capital will flow into the stock market in the foreseeable future.\n\"Over the past year, especially in the first half, there were significant uncertainties, leading to considerable volatility in the capital market, causing fundraising and trading to decrease significantly. This was compounded by concerns about whether the trading system provided equal opportunities for all investor groups. However, the SET and the Securities and Exchange Commission [SEC] have worked together to address these issues, bringing back understanding and restoring confidence,\" he said.\n\"I believe that the Vayupak Fund 1 will help rebuild trust and revive investments from both local and foreign investors.\"\nMr Pichai also mentioned that China has recently used a similar approach to the Vayupak Fund and has been highly successful. This shows that this approach is a \"win-win solution\" for the government, the market, and investors, he noted.\nHe is also feeling bullish that in the near future there is likely to be more investment flowing into the SET from both domestic and international sources, as there are still a lot of funds that have been kept in other forms of deposits, and investors are believed to now analyse how to adjust their investment portfolios.\n\"Nevertheless, I believe that more capital will come in [to the stock market], especially given the declining interest rates. As a result, those who have kept their money in fixed-income assets are likely to shift towards floating-income assets or capital market assets. The Vayupak Fund is a hybrid fund, meaning it is part fixed-income and part floating-income,\" he said.\nMr Pichai added that global investors are now closely watching the stock markets in the Asia-Pacific and Southeast Asian regions, which have become major targets for investment.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat type of house are you most interested in?\nSingle-family home\nTownhouse\nSemi-detached house\nVilla\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nInvestment\nVayupak Fund\nStock\nIndex\nDo you like the content of this article?\n4\n4\nCOMMENT\n(1)",

Against this background, Asean leaders will meet among themselves and with their dialogue partners immediately after to deliberate key issues affecting the community of 675 million citizens.\nOn the economic front, Asean is more robust and confident. As the world's fifth-largest economy, with a combined GDP of US$3.8 trillion (122 trillion baht), it is projected to rank fourth by 2030. Asean's economy is a force to be reckoned with. Furthermore, its economic growth, at 4.6%, is expected to surpass the global average of 3.2%.\nADVERTISEMENT\nAs Laos will hand the baton to the next chair, Malaysia, on Oct 11, there are several issues to observe to judge whether Vientiane has effectively delivered results in its soon-to-end one-year tenure.\nDespite the multitude of pressing domestic issues, the chair must continue to work to achieve consensus among the 10 member countries and dialogue partners.\nSome of these issues to watch for are the following.\nFirst, the world is closely watching what will transpire at the 19th East Asia Summit (EAS) to be held in tandem with this Asean meeting in Vientiane.\nThis year's issue will be the worsening geopolitical landscape in Europe and the Middle East. Last year, the Indonesian chair failed to reach a consensus for a joint EAS statement because of disputed wording on the Ukraine-Russia war. Jakarta opted for the chairman's statement, which is its pejorative, while requesting other EAS members not to issue statements.\nSince the war started in February 2022, the situation in Ukraine has not improved, and the Middle East has also worsened. Israel has been trying to eliminate Hamas for the past year without much achievement. Now, Israel has expanded the war to Lebanon, where arch-rival Hezbollah is located. As it turns out, the talk of a ceasefire so far has been just been kicking the can down the road at the expense of civilian casualties.\nIt must be said that the current Middle East crisis will impact Asean solidarity and its citizens like never before. More specifically, workers from Asean countries, including Thais, have been killed and held hostage as part of the Gaza-Israel conflict. Collectively, Asean has had to appeal for the safety of its citizens in the war zone.\nMeanwhile, the Ukraine-Russia war, which has previously caused disagreements among EAS members, will remain a bone of contention at this EAS.\nIt remains to be seen whether Laos can enable EAS members to reach a consensus on a joint EAS statement. The joint statement is important as it demonstrates that the EAS remains a premium strategic forum for exchanging views on serious global issues in a neutral venue.\nThe Myanmar crisis will also take centre stage, focusing on the progress and implementation of humanitarian assistance as per one point of the Asean Five-Point Consensus. Regarding progress, the Asean Coordinating Centre for Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Management (AHA Centre) has been coordinating aid through the World Food Programme in affected areas inside Myanmar. Thailand recently contributed 9 million baht to the AHA Center for this purpose.\nIn the foreseeable future, there will be two special meetings.\nOne on the Myanmar crisis, will be a meeting of special envoys hosted by Indonesia. It must be noted, the Paetongtarn government has yet to appoint a special Thai envoy on Myanmar.\nThe second is the Asean Troika Plus meeting, scheduled for mid-December in Bangkok. For this meeting, Asean will seek to create common ground for all stakeholders in the Myanmar crisis to find a Myanmar-led solution. Asean members do not want major powers to use the Myanmar quagmire as a proxy war.\nFurthermore, the world's largest free trade agreement, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), is expanding -- this regional economic bloc was built in 2012 upon the existing Asean+1 FTA. Now, three more economies -- Hong Kong, Sri Lanka, and Chile -- have applied to become RCEP members.\nSome members have proposed a \"pre-screening\" step before the accession process. Asean is playing a key role in finalising the accession procedures -- closer consultations and collaboration among major RCEP economies such as Japan and China are needed. The RCEP comprises the Asean-10, China, Japan, Korea, Australia, and New Zealand. India pulled out due to domestic pressure over local farm policies.\nFinally, Asean is currently working on an Asean Community Vision 2045. Over the past year and a half, the Asean High-Level Task Force has crafted this vision. In the next two decades, they want to see Asean agile and relevant in a fast-changing world.\nFor that, Asean prioritises three key areas: digital transformation, sustainable development, and connectivity. By next year, under Malaysia's chairmanship, the first region-wide digital economy in the world, the Asean Digital Economic Framework Agreement, will be completed. This will further strengthen the bloc's efforts to promote digital transformation and connectivity.\nOn sustainability, the bloc has launched the Asean Strategy for Carbon Neutrality to attract more investment and align with international standards for the region's green future. In terms of connectivity, Asean is also developing the Asean Connectivity Strategic Plan, a key document within the Asean Community Vision 2045.\nFinally, at the summit, there will be the chair's 14 economic deliverables (seven will be completed by the end of the year) including enhancing supply chain connectivity, addressing financial gaps for micro, small, and medium enterprises, and upgrading the Asean-China Free Trade Agreement 3.0. These represent the legacy of the Lao chair in 2024.\nKavi Chongkittavorn is a veteran journalist on regional affairs.\nKavi Chongkittavorn\nA veteran journalist on regional affairs\nKavi Chongkittavorn is a veteran journalist on regional affairs\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat is your budget range for purchasing a house in Thailand?\nUnder 3 million THB\n3 million - 5 million THB\n5 million - 8 million THB\n8 million - 12 million THB\nOver 12 million THB\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nThailand\nOpinion\nAsean\nVientiane\n\u0e2d\u0e32\u0e40\u0e0b\u0e35\u0e22\u0e19\n\u0e40\u0e27\u0e35\u0e22\u0e07\u0e08\u0e31\u0e19\u0e17\u0e19\u0e4c\nLeaders\nLaos\nSummit\nDo you like the content of this article?\n5\n18\nCOMMENT\n(2)",

However, in the fourth quarter, we will start to see a slowdown in developed economies, especially in the manufacturing sector (late cycle), which will cause the Asian economy to slow down in the next 3-6 months.\nNew interest rate era: Major central banks, such as those in Europe, the UK, Switzerland and Sweden, have started to cut interest rates. The US Federal Reserve recently made a move for the first time in four years, with a reduction of 50 basis points. It has signalled a further 50bps of cuts this year and possibly another 100bps next year.\nADVERTISEMENT\nNew political era: The outcome of the US election will affect the global economy and politics. Kamala Harris stresses the public welfare with policies that are less business-friendly, especially her plans to raise corporate taxes. In contrast, Donald Trump supports businesses through corporate tax cuts, but would intensify trade wars.\nRegardless of who becomes president, putting campaign policies into action will be challenging as a divided Congress is highly possible. In addition, the risk of a cold war with China remains, increasing global trade risks.\nRELATED\nbusiness\nJitta Wealth promotes US stocks for the coming year\nbusiness\nCGSI forecasts stagnant first-half for Thai stock market\nFED TO MOVE QUICKLY\nLooking at the impact of monetary policy, we expect the Fed to make six rate cuts of 25bps by the end of the first half of 2025, and to slow to quarterly cuts in the second half.\nOther central banks will cut rates at a slower pace, but in any case there will be financial volatility.\nThe US Treasury yield curve, which is normalising from an inverted one, reflects the market's belief in rapid Fed rate cuts. This phenomenon leads to a so-called bull-steepening scenario, where short-term yields decrease faster than the long-term one. Historically this is not favourable for risky assets.\nIn terms of exchange rates, faster and more significant Fed rate cuts compared with those of other central banks will likely weaken the US dollar against currencies such as the yen and euro, as well as the baht, which will strengthen.\nWe foresee the US economy, despite exceeding growth expectations, slowing down in the future, with a soft landing scenario continuing into 2025.\nThe European economy, although improving, will grow more slowly, while China's economy will slow significantly, with our GDP growth forecast adjusted from 5.0% to 4.8%.\nThe latest monetary stimulus indicates a stronger intention to boost the economy and capital markets in China.\nThe People's Bank of China has cut key short-, medium- and long-term loan rates, as well as mortgage interest rates by 20-25bps. The regulator also cut the reserve requirement ratio for commercial banks by 50bps, freeing up 1 trillion yuan ($140 billion) for new lending.\nAn 800-billion-yuan fund is expected to inject capital into the Chinese stock market. Coupled with easing in fiscal policy, expected to be announced soon, these measures could significantly help the Chinese economy, which currently is entering a Japanese-style lost decade scenario.\nTHAI OUTLOOK IMPROVING\nFor the Thai economy, the first half of 2024 saw a significant slowdown because of tight domestic fiscal and monetary policies. The former led to lower capital budget disbursements because of the delayed budget process.\nThe latter led to contracting private investment and durable goods consumption amid strict lending standards. This caused a credit contraction throughout the first half.\nHowever, the change at prime minister and the long-awaited unlocking of the digital wallet stimulus should allow the economy, which slowed in the second and third quarters, to recover in the fourth, with growth expected at 3.5% year-on-year, up from the previous forecast of 2.9%. We project 2.5% growth for the full year.\nIn 2025, the economy will benefit from monetary and fiscal measures, with investment disbursements growing by at least 10.5%. Policy interest rates could be cut by 100bps in 2024-25, but exports may slow, in line with the US and Chinese economies, leading to modest 3% growth next year.\nIn terms of investment strategy, we expect increased market volatility in the final quarter of 2024, benefiting from lower interest rates, which will boost emerging markets compared with developed markets.\nThe weaker dollar will attract capital inflows into emerging markets and Thailand, while initiatives such as the digital wallet, the Vayupak Fund, and 2025 budget disbursement will support investment to some extent.\nThese factors will benefit large domestically focused companies with strong financial positions, reducing the impact of external volatility and the fluctuation and appreciation of the baht. We recommend BDMS, CPALL, HANA and LHHOTEL as standout stocks in the fourth quarter, with a SET index target of 1,500 points in 2024 and 1,550 in 2025.\nDr Piyasak Manason is head of the investment strategy department at InnovestX Securities Co Ltd, a subsidiary of SCBX group.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat is your budget range for renting a condominium?\nUnder 10,000 THB/month\n10,000 - 20,000 THB/month\n20,000 - 40,000 THB/month\n40,000 - 60,000 THB/month\nOver 60,000 THB/month\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nStocks\nInvestment\nDo you like the content of this article?\n4\n0\nCOMMENT",

In line with this trend and following the mainstream popularity of Sichuan-style hotpot in Thailand, Haidilao is proud to introduce a new, unique flavour to Thai tables: the Guizhou Sour Soup Hotpot.&nbsp;\nThis represents not only a fresh, distinctive flavour to delight our guests, but also a fitting debut for Guizhou regional cuisine in Thailand. For Haidilao, the introduction of the Guizhou Sour Soup base marks another breakthrough in our international journey, a worthy addition to our flavour portfolio to enrich our diners' experience of Chinese cuisine. &nbsp;\nThe Long History and Cultural Heritage of Guizhou Sour Soup In China:\n&nbsp;\nADVERTISEMENT\nGuizhou Sour Soup (Gui Zhou Suan Tang Guo) is a traditional dish of the Miao, Dong and other peoples of southeastern Guizhou, with thousands of years of cultural heritage behind it. The most distinctive feature of Guizhou Sour Soup is its tanginess, offering a complex flavour profile: it leads with a sour zest, balanced by a subtle mineral saltiness, all set against a rich, mellow texture. &nbsp;\nThe soup is bright red, vibrant and appetizing. Its tang comes from tomatoes and chili peppers, which are washed, chopped and mixed with salt, then sealed in jars to induce natural fermentation. The intensely red, mouthwatering result is a natural, fragrant, healthy and highly original soup base. &nbsp;\nCompared to Haidilao's classic spicy base, Guizhou\u2019s fermented sour soup offers a fresh, sharp and appetizing flavour with a mellow texture, which is perfect for health-conscious consumers. It appeals to all age groups and satisfies family dining needs.&nbsp;\nThe charm of Guizhou sour soup lies not only in its taste but also in the cultural connotations it carries. Guizhou is home to many ethnic groups, each with its own culinary traditions and cooking techniques. As one of the representative dishes of Guizhou, sour soup is a symbol of the collective wisdom of these ethnic cultures. In Miao culture, sour soup is not only an important part of daily meals but also a symbol of family gatherings and welcoming guests. This flavourful soup reflects Guizhou's natural beauty and embodies a deep respect for nature and a love for life. Haidilao Thailand presents this cultural treasure to the world under the name \"Guizhou Red Sour Soup.\"&nbsp;\nFrom Local Delicacy to Global Stage\n: &nbsp;\nFamed for its unique sour and fresh flavour, Guizhou sour soup has been widely popular in China. With the rise of Chinese cuisine on the global stage, this regional delicacy now has an opportunity to shine internationally. &nbsp;\nThailand, with its love of sour flavours in its own culinary scene, naturally aligns with the flavour profile of Guizhou sour soup. Haidilao has carefully selected a variety of high-quality ingredients to complement the sour soup, ensuring Thai diners can fully experience its deliciousness. Peppercorn beef tongue, with its fragrant spicy flavour, adds layers to the tangy soup, while the tender texture of Haidilao's beef slices enhances the fresh taste. Additionally, seafood such as scallops, prawns, and shrimp paste, along with vegetables like bamboo shoots, sweet potato noodles, bean sprouts and golden slices, are paired with the Guizhou Sour Soup base, offering diners a delightful surprise with every bite. &nbsp;\nContinuous Localisation Strategy as an Engine for Product Innovation\n&nbsp;\nOperating worldwide as Superhi International, Haidilao aims to provide customers with an exceptional dining experience \u2013 localisation is an excellent way to engage diners in every country in an innovative flavour journey. To this end, Super Hi International Holding Ltd. customises products and services based on local customer preferences. In the first half of 2024 alone, Tehai International optimised and launched more than 500 products across various categories, including hotpot bases, dishes, snacks, and drinks. Popular new products were launched in each country, such as Pepper Chicken Soup base and Golden Sour Fish soup base in East Asia, Saffron Chicken Soup base in the UAE, and Spicy Lamb Scorpion (lamb spine) hotpot in the UK.&nbsp;\nEntering Thailand in 2019, Haidilao quickly gained popularity with its unique service concept and excellent dining experience: \u201cFood is the simplest and most effective way of cultural exchange.\u201d From introducing the Tom Yum soup base to adjusting dishes and condiments to suit Thai preferences, Haidilao has blended its brand's essence with local tastes, offering customers a novel and delightful culinary experience. In terms of service, Haidilao adapted its service model and staff training to fit local culture. Through local hiring, flexible training, and cultural integration, Haidilao overcame language and cultural barriers and quickly established itself in the Thai market. Haidilao adheres to the philosophy of \u201cinnovation and sharing,\u201d constantly innovating and striving for excellence. &nbsp;\nThe introduction of the Guizhou Sour Soup base further enriches customers' options, offering an opportunity to sample a deeply authentic Chinese regional flavour that is highly suited to the traditional Thai palate.&nbsp;\nWith the promotion of Guizhou sour soup in the Thai market, Haidilao hopes this traditional Chinese dish will become a bridge connecting Chinese and Thai culinary cultures. In the context of globalisation, Haidilao will continue to explore and promote more regional Chinese delicacies. Internationally, Haidilao aims to let food lovers worldwide experience the unique charm and profound heritage of Chinese cuisine. &nbsp;\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat is your budget range for purchasing a house in Thailand?\nUnder 3 million THB\n3 million - 5 million THB\n5 million - 8 million THB\n8 million - 12 million THB\nOver 12 million THB\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nDo you like the content of this article?\n6\n0\nCOMMENT",

Founded in 1844, the first Western medicine hospital in Shanghai, and one of the oldest in China, has increasingly become a sought-after destination for paediatric liver transplants.\nIn the past decade, dozens of foreign children, mainly from Malaysia, have undergone liver transplants at Renji, which is one of the world's largest medical centres for the highly complex and technically challenging procedure.\nRELATED\nbusiness\nPush for synbio tech to be widely applied\nbusiness\nSoutheast Asian durian growers shrug off threat of Chinese competition\n\"Boosting international medical tourism is now our top priority,\" explained the hospital's deputy director, Sun Yun.\n\"We're looking to bring what we're good at to more people abroad.\"\nBoasting China's biggest population of expatriates, as well as the most inbound tourists, Shanghai is seemingly ideal for such a programme.\nAnd the ambitious undertaking to carve out a piece of the multibillion-dollar global medical tourism market comes as the nation's healthcare system has fostered rapid innovation and technological development to serve the needs of 1.4 billion Chinese people.\nBut industry observers point out that the well-established standing among neighbouring regions could mean China has a long way to go.\nNonetheless, strides have been made across China's medical sectors in recent years.\nThe Boao township in the southern island province of Hainan, having opened a medical tourism pilot zone 11 years ago that now features dozens of institutions, has branded itself Hope City.\nAnd Shenzhen, just across the border from Hong Kong, has joined Shanghai in deploying more resources over the past year to attract medical tourists.\nShenzhen's plan, announced in April, aims to identify 10 hospitals as pilot facilities with standardised services to foster international medical tourism.\nThe city lured 770,000 tourists for medical services last year, mainly from Hong Kong and Macau, as quality improved, while prices were far lower than at private hospitals in neighbouring cities, according to Shenzhen health authorities.\nAnd a relatively small portion of patients came from the US, Canada and Japan, they said.\nThe value of the global medical tourism market, which includes healthcare, services and insurance, was estimated to be US$11.56 billion in 2020, and is expected to reach US$53.51 billion in 2028, according to market research firm Fortune Business Insights.\nPeople wait at a waiting area of a hospital in Shanghai, China. (File photo: Reuters)\nThe 13 designated hospitals in Shanghai treated nearly 270,000 foreign patients in 2023, and they are working on a set of detailed standards for international medical services that are expected to be unveiled later this year, city authorities said in May.\nNearly 20,000 non-Chinese citizens are received by Renji every year, with about 15% travelling from their home regions and the rest comprising mostly expats in Shanghai, according to the hospital's Sun.\nAnd she said most of those travellers are from Southeast Asian nations, as memorandums of understanding have been signed with hospitals in Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines.\n\"Shanghai's high-end medical market has huge room for development,\" Sun said.\n\"We're targeting medical tourists as we have already built a large foundation for general inbound tourism.\"\nThe city of nearly 25 million people received more than 3 million inbound tourists in the first half of this year - marking an increase of 143% year on year - as China extended its 144-hour free transit visa to 54 countries to lure talent and investors.\nShanghai's competitive advantage lies in its experienced doctors, who can treat complicated diseases, which differs from the strategy employed by neighbouring countries in their medical-tourism drives.\n\"Medical technology is definitely the most important thing [in attracting cross-border patients]. We've established a reputation that makes people think of Renji when it comes to liver transplants,\" Sun said.\nIn comparison, the Boao pilot zone in Hainan, approved by the State Council in 2013, has been exploring a wider range of areas, including specially licenced healthcare services, health management, rehabilitation care and anti\u2011ageing aesthetic medicine.\nWith 29 medical institutions operating in the zone, it received around 300,000 medical tourists last year, up by 60% from 2022, according to official data.\nHowever, cities in mainland China are still far from rivalling its neighbours in terms of attractiveness, as they have either built a reputation for quality service, such as Thailand, or at the lower end in terms of price, Taiwan.\n\"It seems likely that the combination of the Thai sector's determination to expand its offerings - into, for example, wellness - and the growing market for medical tourism, mean that the emergence of serious rivals need not be a great worry for Thailand,\" said Michael Montesano, an associate senior fellow specialising in Thailand at the Singapore-based ISEAS Yusof Ishak Research Institute.\n\"[Thai hospitals] bring the sort of hospitality for which the hotel business in Thailand is known [in terms of] reception of patients.\n\"This approach extends to nursing care, and the doctors who staff these hospitals speak English well and work with an appearance of real professionalism and often empathy.\"\nThailand's medical tourism sector ranked in the top five out of 46 countries based on \"destination attractiveness\" and cost, according to the International Healthcare Research Centre, an advocacy and research group.\nA medical room at a hospital. (File photo)\nSeoul resident Park Ji-won flagged language barriers when asked if she were willing to travel to China specifically for healthcare purposes.\n\"I believe Korea already has good medical services where everyone speaks Korean. So, I may go to a domestic hospital for a normal illness instead of one in China, which I lack knowledge of and has language problems,\" she said.\n\"But I may want to go on a traditional medicine tour, as I want to have a try and see the difference in traditional Chinese medicine services in Korea and China.\"\nSouth Korea already has a mature healthcare industry, with the medical tourism market valued at US$1.9 billion in 2023, and it is expected to reach US$3 billion by 2032, according to market research firm IMARC Group.\nSouth Korean officials see the sector as a \"major national industry\" and are working on medical, legal and policy strategies with a goal of attracting 700,000 foreign patients per year by 2027, scholars from two Korean universities said in a 2023 research paper.\nA record of more than 600,000 foreign patients arrived last year, the health ministry said, according to The Korea Times newspaper.\nRelatively high prices may also make people hesitant about travelling to China for medical services, according to analysts.\nParamitaningrum, an international relations lecturer at Bina Nusantara University in Jakarta, said Indonesians would only consider Shanghai or Guangzhou for serious illness, such as kidney problems.\n\"As far as I know, if the medical treatment can be done somewhere nearby, like in Penang [Malaysia] or Singapore, they prefer going to these two places, because they're close and cheaper than Shanghai,\" she said.\nTaiwan, which ventured into the medical tourism industry before mainland China, is another competitor for its cost-effective healthcare at \"competitive\" quality levels, according to Hu Jin-li, a professor with the Institute of Business and Management at the National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University in Taipei.\n\"Taiwan's advantage is that medical costs are much lower than those in neighbouring economies, such as Hong Kong, Japan and South Korea, while the medical quality in Taiwan is competitive with these economies,\" he said.\n\"Taiwan's large hospitals are equipped with advanced devices under efficient utilisation and quality controls. Moreover, Taiwan has convenient transport, communications [and] hotels.\"\nAbout 228,000 medical tourists received treatment in Taiwan last year, according to the government-backed Taiwan Task Force for Medical Travel.\nBut in Shanghai, despite Renji's early success, luring international travellers for healthcare remains difficult for some of the city's other hospitals involved in the pilot scheme.\nOnly two young patients, both from Europe, have been flown to Shanghai Children's Medical Centre - another of the 13 designated hospitals - for treatment since the city's initiative was launched in September last year.\n\"It's a trial, and it's still in a very early stage,\" said Cherry Jiang, who works in the hospital's publicity department.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhich app or platform do you usually use to book accommodations?\nBooking.com\nAgoda\nAirbnb\nTrip.com\nTraveloka\nExpedia\nSkyscanner\nDirectly with the accommodation\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nChina\nMedical tourism\nTourism\nThailand\nTaiwan\nUnited states\nHealth\nDo you like the content of this article?\n3\n10\nCOMMENT\n(8)",

And the prospect of additional supply chain disruptions to food imports is undeniably alarming for governments. While some like the Philippines import more than 25%, others like Singapore import over 90%.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe food security of Southeast Asia and that of Northeast Asia is linked. Figures for food import dependence in Northeast Asia for key agricultural products are even more alarming. For instance, Japan, which imports about 62% of its food, relies on imports for wheat (83%), soybeans (78%) and edible oils (97%).\nRELATED\nopinion\nUniting against cyber-scam gangs\nbusiness\nCar firms warned of new Australia rule\nBoosting domestic agricultural production seems like the obvious answer. Yet the severity of challenges that countries face (like land and water constraints) cannot be solved overnight. Instead, a regional approach is needed.\nSome steps have already been undertaken. Notably, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Plus Three Emergency Rice Reserve (Asean APTERR) with China, Japan and South Korea provides a collective rice reserve for use in emergencies or natural disasters. However, the current environment shows that stronger measures, drawing on leading food-producing partners like Australia, are needed.\nTo achieve this, Asean, Australia and New Zealand could jointly form an Asean Plus Five collective emergency reserves and food-sharing platform. The inclusion of Australia and New Zealand -- dual agricultural powerhouses and exporters -- could create a food-sharing platform of about 2.2 billion people across 15 countries. Doing so would bring together leading food exporters and the major importers.\nAustralia and New Zealand are leading exporters of grains, dairy, meat and oilseeds. The former is the world's biggest sheep and mutton exporter and supplies over 13% of global wheat exports. A leading beef and barley exporter, Australia also exports more modest quantities of oilseeds (like canola).\nNew Zealand, for its part, is the world's biggest dairy exporter and second-largest global lamb and mutton exporter. It is also a major beef exporter.\nSoutheast and Northeast Asian countries are major importers and consumers of these agricultural products. For instance, during the 2022\u20132023 marketing year, most Australian wheat was exported to China (a record 6.4 million tonnes) and Indonesia (3.49 million tonnes). Other leading buyers included Vietnam (2.38 million tonnes), South Korea (2.26 million tonnes) and the Philippines (2.22 million tonnes).\nFood demands in the region will continue rising due to growing populations, expanding middle classes and higher incomes. This will further strain current food production and trade. Yet increasing demands are unlikely to be met by Asian agricultural producers/exporters alone.\nAustralia and New Zealand are well-placed to help. Participating in the proposed Asean mechanism could turn them into the region's much-needed \"food bowl\", boosting exports and intra-regional trade.\nThere are other benefits for Canberra and Wellington. Stronger economic ties reflect the governments' interests in Asia, including pivots to Southeast Asia. For Canberra in particular, the security and prosperity of both Australia and Southeast Asia are interlinked, as the Southeast Asia Economic Strategy to 2040 points out.\nHowever, challenges lie ahead. Aside from lingering tensions between China and Australia and tensions in hotspots like the South China Sea, other concerns like climate shocks and natural resource competition, which exacerbate food inflation and damage agricultural production, should be noted.\nBroader concerns about the viability of and resilience in the Australia-Asean partnership as well as Australia's bilateral relations with states in Southeast Asia and Northeast Asia should be considered too. In recent years, Canberra's food export policies at times have raised the ire of its trading partners.\nNotably, in 2011, Australia imposed a temporary six-month ban on live cattle exports to Indonesia following the release of footage showing animal cruelty in Indonesian abattoirs. This move was a pivotal moment in Australia's agricultural and diplomatic relations with Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia, which is a key importer of Australian livestock.\nThe temporary ban and sudden loss of a key export market also had significant economic repercussions for Australian stakeholders including farmers and exporters through the adverse impact on economic activity and cash flows. Estimates at the time of the ban suggested that the suspension of all live cattle exports to Indonesia could cost the industry as much as AU$320 million (7.3 billion baht).\nOn the diplomatic front, the ban strained Australia-Indonesia relations. Indonesian officials condemned the decision, viewing it as an interference in their domestic affairs and economic interests.\nThe live export dispute between Australia and Indonesia was later resolved through negotiations and commitments to improve animal welfare standards.\nAustralia learned significant lessons from this episode. In particular, the dispute helped Australian policymakers better understand local conditions and the importance of working in consultation and collaboration with Southeast Asian partners.\nFor any food security grouping to work, Australia must also consider potential challenges with Northeast Asian partners. For instance, its barley trade with China has been marred by significant disputes. The most prominent occurred in 2020 when China imposed 80.5% anti-dumping tariffs on barley imports, effectively blocking exports to the Chinese market. China's Ministry of Commerce claimed that Australian barley was being sold at unfairly low prices, which they argued harmed the domestic barley industry in China.\nThe tariffs impacted the Australian barley industry. Between 2014 and 2015 and 2018 and 2019, Australian barley exports to China averaged approximately AU$1.2 billion a year. However, Australian farmers and exporters were forced to find alternative markets such as Saudi Arabia and Vietnam. Concurrently, the average value of barley exports dropped from AU$407 per ton in 2019\u201320 to AU$310 per ton in 2020\u201321.\nSince the lifting of the tariffs in August last year by Beijing, however, the overwhelming majority of Australian barley exports -- 78% -- have been exported to China.\nTo help restore trust with Beijing, Canberra may engage in sustained diplomatic dialogue. Establishing regular high-level meetings between trade representatives could help address misunderstandings as well as provide a platform for resolving food import/export-related disputes within the proposed Asean Plus Five mechanism.\nAmid an increasingly fractured geopolitical environment, stronger intra-regional trading and wider emergency food reserves could support greater regional stability and resilience to transnational challenges.\nAnd there is a need to do so -- food is too important to leave off the region's policy menu.\nGenevieve Donnellon-May is an independent researcher.

The company reported a remarkable net profit increase of 973%, or 10 times the previous amount, driven primarily by its international business. CP Foods also announced an interim dividend payment of THB 0.45 per share.\nCP Foods reported sales revenue for Q2/2024 amounting to THB 149,498 million, with 64% of total revenue coming from its overseas operations, 30% from its Thai businesses, and 6% from exports out of Thailand. Net profit reached THB 6,925 million in Q2 this year, reflecting a 973% increase compared to Q2 last year. This substantial growth was mainly attributed to an improved gross profit margin and increased share of profit from associates and joint ventures.&nbsp;\nThe primary factor contributing to the improved gross profit margin, which reached approximately 15% this year, was the reduced cost of animal husbandry, driven by lower raw material costs. Enhanced production efficiency and cost management, along with higher global pig prices, particularly in Vietnam and Cambodia following the rebalancing of production volume after an oversupply of meat and the recent ASF epidemic, also played a significant role.&nbsp;\nADVERTISEMENT\nProfit from associates and joint ventures totalled THB 3,352 million, marking a 475% increase. This was largely due to the better performance of associates in the animal feed and pig businesses in the People's Republic of China, where pig prices were higher than in the same period last year. Additionally, CP ALL Public Company Limited's improved performance contributed to the overall profit increase.&nbsp;\nPrasit Boondoungprasert, Chief Executive Officer of CP Foods, stated that the improved performance represents a recovery of the company's business back to normal after a challenging year marked by increased costs and a meat glut in several countries. The company has been focused on closely monitoring market conditions, analysing consumer behaviour, and optimising efficiency across all processes. These efforts have enabled CP Foods to maintain competitive costs and produce products at prices that consumers can afford.&nbsp;\nThe better-than-expected performance in the second quarter was driven by strong results from overseas operations, particularly in Vietnam and Cambodia, as well as improved performance from the joint venture in the animal feed and pig business in China. Enhanced farming efficiency led to lower overall costs, coupled with higher pig prices compared to the previous year.&nbsp;\nLooking ahead to the second half of the year, the company recognises the ongoing challenges posed by economic conditions and geopolitical conflicts. As a result, CP Foods remains cautious in its investments and continues to develop sustainable innovations to enhance competitiveness. The company is also preparing to adjust its trade strategies to adapt to evolving consumer behaviour. Furthermore, CP Foods remains fully committed to its Net-Zero goal by 2050.&nbsp;\nThe Board of Directors of CP Foods has approved the payment of an interim dividend for the first half of this year at THB 0.45 per share, representing 46% of net profit for the first six months of 2024. The Record Date is set for 30 August (XD on 29 August), and the dividend payment date is scheduled for 13 September 2024.&nbsp;\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nHow important are environmental sustainability practices (e.g., eco-friendly rooms, waste reduction) when choosing accommodation in Thailand?

Historically, Thailand's GDP has grown as high as 5-6%,\" said Mr Pichai.\nADVERTISEMENT\n\"I wish to see Thailand's current real GDP growth at 3.5%.\"\nHe said an appropriate inflation rate for Thailand should be at least 2%, noting that in some countries with policies promoting high economic growth, inflation of 2.5% is acceptable.\nRELATED\nworld\nKorean lawmakers try again to impeach president\nbusiness\nMinister in no hurry to appoint new central bank chairman\nMr Pichai said over the past decade, Thailand's economic growth has been relatively low.\nFrom the pandemic years of 2020-2021 until now, average economic growth has been only 0.4%.\nLast year growth was 1.9%, and this year it is forecast to be 2.7%.\nOver the past 10 years, Thailand's manufacturing sector, especially small businesses, have dwindled.\nDuring certain periods, the utilisation rate dropped as low as 50%, while the prices of goods have also decreased, he said.\n\"We have to choose. Do we want lower prices for goods, but not much money to buy things? Or do we want higher prices for goods, but more money in consumers' pockets?\" said Mr Pichai.\nHe said he prefers economic growth to austerity measures.\nTo drive economic growth, Mr Pichai said it is essential to promote domestic investment. The country's liquidity is sufficient to support investment, but investment levels have sagged in recent years, he said.\n\"We have become a country that is financially stable, but has low investment, resembling a wealthy individual without a future,\" said Mr Pichai.\nHe said the direction of Thailand's investment should align with global trends, such as digital and the green economy, as well as efforts to develop human skills.\nAt the CEO Econmass Awards 2024, Mr Pichai made the case for economic growth and higher inflation.\nAccording to Mr Pichai, for 2023 and this year, Board of Investment applications submitted and approved total 2 trillion baht, the highest level in a decade.\nOne investment promotion policy this government will push is amending the leasehold asset law, extending land lease agreements up to 99 years from the current 30 years, he said.\nMr Pichai said the effort aims to provide foreign investors with confidence in long-term investments that are worthwhile, offering land rights that allow foreigners to sell them or use them as collateral for loans from financial institutions.\nIf Thai private entities wish to sell land to foreigners, this can be done, but the approach requires the private sector to first transfer land ownership to the state, then the leasehold asset law gives foreigners the right to utilise the land under a 99-year lease agreement, he said.\nMr Pichai insisted investment stimulus requires infrastructure investment, especially in logistics. Logistics costs account for 18% of Thai GDP.\nHe said an important project is the Land Bridge, which seeks to create a transport hub between two oceans, specifically targeting the shipment of goods to and from China by reducing costs.\nHOPEFUL YEAR\nThe Joint Standing Committee on Commerce, Industry and Banking (JSCCIB), which joined an economic forum at the same event, echoed the ministry's GDP growth outlook for 2025, believing it will be driven by tourism, government stimulus measures and an improving global economy.\nThe group expects Thai GDP growth of 3.5-4% next year, with improving trade bolstering Thai exports, a significant contributor to GDP.\n\"The JSCCIB hopes geopolitical conflicts will not turn more severe, affecting the Thai economy,\" said Kriengkrai Thiennukul, chairman of the Federation of Thai Industries.\nAs tourism continues to recover, foreign tourist arrivals should reach 40 million next year, up from a target of 36 million this year, he said.\nPayong Srivanich, chairman of the Thai Bankers' Association, warned prolonged high levels of household debt threaten to affect the 2025 economy.\n\"Household debt will weaken people's purchasing power and economic growth,\" he said.\nThe Thai economy should grow by 3% this year, but severe flooding in the North dealt a blow to the economy, reducing it to a gain of 2.6-2.7%, said Sanan Angubolkul, chairman of the Thai Chamber of Commerce.\nHe said he supports the government effort to seek membership in BRICS, a grouping comprising Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa.\nBRICS is working on a new payment system to reduce their reliance on the US dollar.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat is your preferred price range per night for accommodation in Bangkok?\n1,000 - 3,000 THB\n3,000 - 5,000 THB\n5,000 - 8,000 THB\nOver 8,000 THB\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nFinance Ministry\nEconomic growth\nCEO Econmass Awards 2024\nDo you like the content of this article?\n5\n90\nCOMMENT\n(20)",

The 16th annual Brics Summit in Kazan, Russia, set the stage for the gathering of what's essentially the \"Alternative economic club\" to the established Western groups such as the G-7 and the IMF. Thirty-five 35 delegations, including 24 heads of state and government, journeyed to Kazan for a three-day summit and schmooze session with the otherwise diplomatically isolated Russian president.\nMr Putin set the tone for the group to become a powerful economic bloc, or at least try to sound that way, as well as countering the reality that Russia faces isolation from the global economy.\nKazan, deep in the steppes of Russia and 804km east of Moscow and part of the nominal Muslim Republic of Tatarstan, was chosen to showcase Russia's image between West and East and friend of the Global South. This historic city on the Volga, Kazan, has a mixed population of Muslim and Orthodox Russians.\nADVERTISEMENT\nLet's face it: An economic grouping of Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa holds clout in geographic size, resources, population, and production, at least on paper. Just this year, Brics admitted new members: Egypt, Ethiopia, and Iran.\nRELATED\nworld\nAustralia passes social media ban for under-16s\nopinion\nThe world's babies need antibiotics\nWhat hurts the group remains corruption, weak institutions and even political tensions among its partners, such as the long-time China/India border dispute. Conversely, Russia, China, and India form a crucial land mass that holds significant economic clout.\nWhen the group was founded in 2006, many hailed it as a realistic alternative to what's deemed as Western-oriented economic/financial institutions. The Brics present themselves as the alternative to Western organisations and are thus increasingly attuned to the Global South, aka former Third World.\nWithout question, Beijing dominates Brics if only for size and economic standing, one of the world's largest economies. China's communist leader, Xi Jinping, beamed in the glow of the Summit as much as did India's capitalist Prime Minister, Narendra Modi. Mr Putin approved.\nBut Brics is more about politics and posturing than classic economics. The Russian president clearly views the group as a political tool as well as a safe haven for Moscow's policy aspirations even in the aftermath of his Ukraine invasion.\n\"For Putin, the summit is the most important foreign policy event of the year, and he wants to use it to present himself on the world stage as a leader who is not internationally isolated but who, with the Brics states, represents the future 'world majority'\" states Germany's respected Friedrich Naumann Foundation for Freedom.\nThe surprise visit of UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres created bad optics for him, given the setting and international situation. Though his visit was politically slammed by Ukraine, it does the UN no good to be seen mingling with Mr Putin, a person with an arrest warrant from the International Criminal Court. As curiously, Mr Guterres spent Oct 24, historically commemorated as UN Day, in a country which currently is violating the territorial integrity of another UN member state, Ukraine, thus breaking international law.\nTo his credit, Mr Guterres's speech challenged Moscow's narrative, \"We need peace in Ukraine. A just peace in line with the UN Charter, International law and General Assembly resolutions.\"\nIran's new membership in Brics is surprising; a heavily sanctioned regime savours political legitimacy. But Iran's petroleum economy is on the upswing, with over 1.8 million barrels of oil sold per day, mostly to China. Why? Though facing suffocating economic sanctions under former President Trump, the Biden/Harris Administration has often waived tough sanctions enforcement on Tehran. Thus, Iran has much more cash to support its Mideast proxies, such as Hamas and Hezbollah, and has a better economic standing.\nInterestingly, Turkish President Erdogan is vying for Brics membership; should he be accepted, they would become the first Nato member. Conversely, Argentina's free market President, Javier Milei, withdrew his country from the group last year.\nA major Brics focus is to study using alternatives to the US dollar for global trade. Russia has stressed the promotion and development of alternative financial instruments and clearing systems in order to minimise dependence on Western currencies and the SWIFT system.\nSomehow, I don't feel that many countries, even among the Brics, will substitute using the rouble, the real, the rand, the rupee or the yuan to largely replace the US dollar anytime soon for major commercial transactions.\nBut take note. Brice represents an erosion of the post-war Western-based economic order.\nJohn J Metzler is a United Nations correspondent covering diplomatic and defense issues.

Most Thais see their nation as part of a dynamic and rising region, and they believe Thailand needs to increase international cooperation and play a more active global role in addressing emerging challenges.\nThese insights come from a survey by the Asia Foundation, \"Thai Public Views on International Issues\", released last week. The survey was the first to examine Thai public opinion on foreign policy and international affairs.\nThe survey was conducted nationwide from July to November 2023, during an important political transition as the new civilian elected government -- a Pheu Thai-led coalition -- took power and pledged a more proactive diplomatic approach.\nADVERTISEMENT\nPrime Minister Srettha Thavisin reiterated that Thailand is committed to multilateralism and respect for human rights. The new administration said it would also promote foreign trade and attract direct foreign investment under economic-centered diplomacy.\nRELATED\nopinion\nRe-energising Thai-US relations\nlife\nGrim realities\nThe researchers interviewed 1,650 urban Thai adults across all regions, finding that a high percentage were knowledgeable about international issues, allowing for more in-depth questioning.\nInterestingly, the survey found that the urban Thai population is nearly evenly split in the direction of the country.\nHalf believe Thailand is headed in the wrong direction compared to 46% who see it as moving in the right direction. Younger respondents were particularly pessimistic, with 67% saying Thailand is on the wrong track.\nHowever, four out of five Thais believe Southeast Asia as a whole is heading in a positive direction, and an overwhelming 97% see Asean membership as beneficial for the country. Around half would like Thailand to take on a greater regional leadership role.\nOn the roles of the US and China, the Thai public generally views both countries as having a similar, largely positive impact on peace and security in Asia.\nThey believe the two powers do more good than harm for regional stability, with their economic ties and educational links seen as more valuable than military or governance influence.\nA clear majority of 66% see China as the most influential country in Asia today, far outpacing the 22% who view the US as the most influential.\nHowever, Thais anticipate that the US and China will remain the two most important countries in Thailand's future, with 72% expecting China to be the dominant power in the next decade compared to only 15% for the US.\nMost Thais want to maintain positive relations with both superpowers, avoiding siding with either, though 19% would like Thailand to align more closely with one or the other. When asked about a potential US-China armed conflict, 86% of Thais preferred neutrality rather than taking a side.\nSignificantly, well-informed Thai respondents view China and the US as generally benign or friendly, with 52% seeing China as friendly to Thailand, compared to 33% who view it as exploitative -- a net positive gap of 19 percentage points. The US has a similar 17-point net positive advantage, with 44% seeing it as friendly versus 27% as exploitative.\nAmong those Thais who want their country to become a close partner of China or the US, there is a slight preference for China. However, younger Thais who choose a side tend to favour aligning with the US.\nThe survey also revealed Thai public sentiment towards regional issues, particularly the Myanmar crisis. While foreign experts often view the Myanmar situation as a top priority for Thailand, only 2% of Thai respondents share this view, and just 9% believe Thailand should prioritise helping Myanmar refugees.\nHowever, most Thais support Thailand's deepening economic ties with Myanmar, Cambodia, and Laos, and 20% want the government to assist migrants from these neighbouring countries.\nNotably, Thai respondents view Cambodia, Myanmar, and Russia negatively. Cambodia and Myanmar have significant net negative gaps of 23 and 21 percentage points, respectively, regarding being seen as exploitative rather than friendly.\nRussia has a smaller 4-point net negative gap, with 45% of Thais viewing it as neutral. The rest of Asean countries and dialogue partners are seen as friendly.\nThe survey also asked the respondents about the new government's highest priorities for Thai foreign policy. Most identified economic growth and national security, followed by the air/haze situation and climate change.\nThe survey found that a slight majority of 54% are dissatisfied with the state of Thai democracy, particularly among younger citizens at 59%. Yet Thais overwhelmingly see democracy as the best form of governance, with 90% of youth and 84% overall believing it is \"always the best way\".\nWhen asked if Western countries like the US and Europe can do more to promote democracy and human rights in Thailand, most respondents agreed, with 71% of young people and 66% overall in favour. It is also important to note that older Thais were slightly less likely to agree, at 63%.\nWhile older Thais are more sceptical about external influences on Thai democracy, a plurality, though not a majority, believe such influences can be beneficial. In contrast, younger Thais tend to view external democratic support more positively.\nThe survey also observed that changes in Thailand's foreign policy and regional leadership would be highly consequential for mainland Southeast Asia, Asean, and geopolitics more broadly.\nAs the region's second-largest economy and the geographic centre of the Mekong subregion, Thailand routinely influences the security, migration, energy, and economic integration of neighbouring countries.\nThis 54-page survey report provides invaluable insights for policymakers and other stakeholders seeking to understand Thai public sentiment on foreign policy and regional cooperation issues. It should be on their reading lists.\nKavi Chongkittavorn\nA veteran journalist on regional affairs\nKavi Chongkittavorn is a veteran journalist on regional affairs\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat is your preferred house size (in terms of number of bedrooms)?\n1 bedroom\n2\u20133 bedrooms\n4+ bedrooms\nNo preference\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nDo you like the content of this article?\n7\n37\nCOMMENT\n(14)",

(Photo: Reuters)\nSINGAPORE - As Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese Premier Li Qiang wrapped up separate meetings in Southeast Asia this week, the two partners in the Brics economic bloc encountered a region keen to join a group seen as a hedge against Western-led institutions.\nDuring an interview with Chinese media ahead of Li's visit to Malaysia, Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim declared his intention to apply to the bloc after it doubled in size this year by luring Global South nations \u2014 partly by offering access to financing but also by providing a political venue independent of Washington's influence.&nbsp;\nThailand \u2014 a US treaty ally \u2014 last month announced its own bid to join Brics, named after members Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa. The bloc \"represents a south-south cooperative framework which Thailand has long desired to be a part of,\" Foreign Affairs Minister Maris Sangiampongsa told reporters last week.\nOpinion:&nbsp;\nThailand's Brics move is misguided\nADVERTISEMENT\nAds powered by\nFor countries seeking to mitigate the economic risks of intensifying US-China competition, joining Brics is an attempt to straddle some of those tensions. In Southeast Asia, many nations depend economically on trade with China while also simultaneously welcoming the security presence and investment Washington provides.\nRELATED\nopinion\nRebel win to reshape Syria's fragile future\nproperty\nForeigners drive Phuket condo segment\nBut Brics membership is also a way of signalling increasing frustration with the US-led international order and key institutions that remain firmly in the control of Western powers, like the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF).\n\"Some of us, including people like myself, think that we need to find solutions to the unfair international financial and economic architecture,\" former Malaysian Foreign Minister Saifuddin Abdullah said in an interview. \"So, Brics would probably be one of the ways to balance some things.\"\nUkraine summit\nFor Putin and Chinese leader Xi Jinping, the interest in Brics also shows their success at pushing back at attempts by the United States and its allies to isolate them more broadly over the war in Ukraine and military threats to Taiwan, the Philippines, South Korea and Japan.&nbsp;\nUkraine leader Volodymyr Zelenskiy struggled to convince Asian nations to back his peace summit in Switzerland earlier this month, and\nPutin this week signed a defence pact with North Korea\nwhile warning he had the right to arm US adversaries around the world.\nIn this pool photograph distributed by the Russian state agency Sputnik, two guards stand underneath portraits of Russian President Vladimir Putin, left, and North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un during a welcome ceremony at Kim Il Sung Square in Pyongyang on Wednesday.\nA club that for years consisted of just five members expanded with the inclusion of Iran, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Ethiopia and Egypt this January. That was a push largely driven by China as it tries to increase its clout on the global stage.\nAnother Southeast Asian nation, Indonesia, was considered an early favourite to join last year before President Joko Widodo indicated he would not be rushed into the decision.\nStill, the momentum to add new members has continued. Despite US and European efforts to prevent countries from dealing with Moscow, representatives from 12 non-member nations appeared at a Brics Dialogue in Russia this month. They included longtime US foes like Cuba and Venezuela, but also nations such as Turkey, Laos, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Kazakhstan.\nAlso present was Vietnam, which last year upgraded ties with Washington in a move seen as pushback on Beijing's rising influence in the region. Hanoi has been following the grouping\u2019s progress with \u201ckeen interest,\u201d as state broadcaster\nVoice of Vietnam\nput it last month.&nbsp;\n\"Vietnam is always ready to participate in and contribute actively to global and regional multilateral mechanisms,\" Foreign Ministry spokesperson Pham Thu Hang said at the time.\nVietnam welcomed Russia\u2019s leader this week despite strong objections from the US on the grounds that \u201cno country should give Putin a platform to promote his war of aggression\u201d in Ukraine. Vietnam and Russia have ties going back to the Cold War and Soviet era.\nIn their joint statement issued at the conclusion of their talks, Russia welcomed Vietnam's participation in the dialogue earlier this month and said they would \"continue to strengthen ties between the Brics countries and developing countries, including Vietnam.\"\nIt was not clear how much Brics was part of Putin's closed-door talks in Vietnam, though the two nations pledged to boost defence and energy cooperation. China's Li used his trip to Malaysia deepen trade and economic ties and advance construction of major projects.&nbsp;\nUnwieldy group\nAfter this year\u2019s expansion, Brics plans to invite non-member countries to take part in its next summit in the Russian city of Kazan in October. Just hosting the event gives Moscow a chance to showcase to the world that it is not totally isolated by Western opposition to the war in Ukraine.&nbsp;\n\"It's no secret that Washington doesn't love the Brics, particularly with Iran and Russia\u2019s membership,\" said Scot Marciel, a former US ambassador to Indonesia, Myanmar and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean).&nbsp;\nAt the same time, the larger the bloc grows, the less likely it is to find consensus on key issues, he said. \"My sense is, Washington is probably not applauding the move by Thailand and Malaysia to join it, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to cause massive heartburn.\"\nOfficials at the US State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&nbsp;\nThe potential benefits for joining Brics go beyond geopolitics.&nbsp;\nUS$33 billion\nThe bloc\u2019s members have agreed to pool $100 billion of foreign-currency reserves, which they can lend to each other during emergencies. The group also founded the New Development Bank \u2014 a World Bank-modelled institution that has approved almost $33 billion of loans mainly for water, transport and other infrastructure projects since it began operations in 2015.\nThat investment pool would be useful in Southeast Asia, where official development finance dwindled to a low of $26 billion in 2022, according to a report this month by the Sydney-based Lowy Institute.\nAnother draw to membership, Malaysia's Saifuddin said, is the residual negative sentiment toward institutions like the IMF, which pushed austerity measures sometimes blamed in the region for worsening the economic hardship caused by the Asian financial crisis in the late 1990s.\nWashington is not sitting still. It has deepened security links in the region on matters like counter-terrorism, and with countries like Vietnam and the Philippines who are increasingly worried about their disputes with Beijing in the South China Sea. But as the great power competition intensifies across the board, there is also a recognition the region needs to hedge its bets.\n\"There is increasingly less space for smaller countries to manoeuvre,\" Ong Keng Yong, the former secretary general of Asean said in an interview. \"By joining organisations like Brics, countries are signalling that they want to be friendly to all sides, not just to the US and its allies.\"\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat type of building do you prefer for a condominium?\nHigh-rise (more than 10 floors)\nMid-rise (5-10 floors)\nLow-rise (less than 5 floors)\nNo preference\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nRussia\nChina\nBrics\nPutin\nXi jinping\nAsia\nDo you like the content of this article?\n36\n45\nCOMMENT\n(54)",

The index peaked at 1,389 points before pulling back below 1,370. Among the key factors expected to influence trading going forward:\nChinese economic recovery: A potential rally in global equities is anticipated due to Chinese economic stimulus measures, including property market support and the establishment of the China Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund (ICF).\nSecond-quarter earnings speculation: Speculative bets on second-quarter earnings are nearing their end. We expect the SET index to see a quarter-on-quarter decline in aggregate net profit to 270 billion baht attributed to longer holidays and potential headwinds from high US interest rates, domestic economic factors and the Middle East situation.\nFed meeting: While investors are still hoping for a Federal Reserve rate cut in September, high US inflation (above the 2% target) and geopolitical tensions create uncertainty. Next week's Fed meeting might offers some clues to the direction.\nThai politics: The government's \"Ignite Thailand\" initiative aims to attract foreign investment and position the country as an agriculture and food hub, among others. However, potential political overhang exists related to court cases against the prime minister as well as former PM Thaksin Shinawatra.\nJUNE OUTLOOK\nThe market's earlier failure to close the gap at 1,394 points could trigger a sharp decline below 1,330, potentially leading to a steeper decline towards 1,320 and 1,308. Conversely, if support at 1,330 holds, the index might experience sideways movement within a range bounded by resistance at 1,380 and 1,400.\nConsider a short-term trading approach to master market volatility. However,  certain stocks remain attractive, particularly those with strong growth potential, robust second-quarter outlooks or exposure to ESG themes and the Chinese economic recovery. Our stock picks for June include:\nBBL (Buy, target 175 baht): Our target for the bank is based on a 2024 price-to-book value (PBV) of 0.6 times, 1.0 standard deviation (SD) below the 10-year average. The stock also has a compelling valuation at 0.5 times PBV (1.25 SD below the 10-year average). Strong risk management, with a sector-leading 292% coverage ratio, provides a buffer.\nCKP (Buy, target 4.50 baht): Our discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis, using a 5.5% weighted average cost of capital (WACC) with no terminal growth value, justifies a buy rating for the power producer. Key catalysts include the receding El Ni\u00f1o effect and the upcoming high season in the third quarter.\nCPALL (Buy, target 84 baht): Our target for the 7-Eleven operator is based on a 2024 price/earnings (PE) ratio of 34 times (0.3 SD below the five-year average). Currently trading at 23 times PE, the stock is undervalued considering the strong growth potential in the second quarter during the high season.\nNER (Buy, target 6.80 baht): Our target for the rubber manufacturer is based on a 2024 PE of 7 times (0.5 SD above the five-year average). Key catalysts include an upcoming overseas investment project, expected to be finalised in the second half of this year, and further development related to its new plant.\nPRM (Buy, target 9.70 baht): Our target for the offshore oilfield services firm is based on a 2024 core PE of 11 times (1.0 SD below the five-year average). A planned capital reduction for repurchased shares through a buyback programme is expected to further boost earnings per share (EPS) by an estimated 7.5%.\nSAPPE (Buy, target 106 baht): Our target price is based on a 2024 PE of 25 times (2.25 SD above the five-year average). Key strengths include a position as a leading global beverage producer, consistent capacity expansion (25-30% annually), and attractive valuation (2024 PE of 24.5 times) relative to impressive EPS growth (41% compound annual growth rate from 2022-24).\nTOP (Buy, target 65 baht): While we project a 22% year-on-year decline in the oil refiner's net profit to 15.2 billion baht in 2024 due to crack spreads returning to normal, overall performance is expected to remain strong. Gross refining margin is still estimated to be high at $7.70 a barrel, and refinery run rates are forecast to stay elevated at 104%. Our target is based on a 2024 PBV of 0.84 times (1.0 SD below the five-year average).\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat type of house are you most interested in?\nSingle-family home\nTownhouse\nSemi-detached house\nVilla\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nStocks\nShares\nInvestment\nDo you like the content of this article?\n0\n1\nCOMMENT",

With such a clear-eyed vision, nobody expected a thunderbolt from the potential member from Southeast Asia announcing the desire to join Brics.\nADVERTISEMENT\nA senior veteran Thai diplomat described the Thai hedging strategy by referencing a hypothetical Hollywood movie with the working title of: \"OECD and Brics: Everything all at once\".\nOfficials at Saranrom Palace probably had a stressful time last week as they had to explain the rationale behind the country's rebarbative move to the Bangkok-based Western diplomatic community who are dumbfounded as to why the country wanted to join Brics at this particular moment, given the bloc's strong \"anti-West\" rhetoric, its stances on the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, the currency war, and the struggle for a new world order.\nRELATED\nopinion\nKorea martial law lessons for Thailand\nopinion\nTrump redux and US-Thai-Asean ties\nHowever, according to government spokesperson Chai Wacharonke, it is Thailand's opportunity to join Brics, which is trying to enlarge its membership base. He added that the current Brics chair, Russia, has invited Thailand to attend the 16th Brics summit in the Russian city of Kazan in October. At the summit, Thailand can accelerate its accession to Brics, enhance its role as a leader among developing countries, and increase its opportunity to shape international economic policymaking.\nThe letter of intent, signed by Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin, stated that Thailand places importance on multilateralism and the increased representation of developing countries in the international system. As such, Thailand, as a Brics member, would benefit the country by elevating its international role and augmenting its leverage to shape a new world order.\nThe decision to join Brics is more than meets the eye. The bid is the decision from the top echelons of the Pheu Thai-led cabinet. It must be noted that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommended that Thailand focus on OECD membership first and then expressed the intention to join Brics later.\nAt the very least, it should be after the OECD Council had decided to consider the Thai bid for accession on June 19 in Paris. So far, Thailand has received positive feedback and support from OECD members, but now the ministry is concerned that Western friends and allies will see Thailand's Brics bid as a reason why it won't end up joining the OECD.\nMeanwhile, Mr Chai is confident that the decision to admit Thailand into Brics could be made by October. The kingdom has good relations with all 10 Brics members, and Thailand and Brics are on the same page when it comes to vision, principles and objectives. Most importantly, both place importance on multilateralism and the increased representation of developing countries in the international system.\nNotably, the current Brics chair, President Vladimir Putin, has maintained a good personal relationship with Thaksin, who was Thai prime minister from 2001-2006. Having Thailand as a Brics member under Mr Putin's watch would be a manifestation of Thaksin's political clout and their good personal ties.\nNext week, Foreign Minister Maris Sangiampongsa is scheduled to attend a special ministerial session on the sidelines of the Brics foreign ministerial meeting in Nizhny Novgorod. He will meet with his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov and deliver the letter of intent to join Brics. This also comes as Pheu Thai chief Paetongtarn Shinawatra prepares to travel to Vladivostok to attend a Brics meeting of the leading government parties in mid-June at Moscow's invitation.\nBrics has been on the Thai diplomatic radar since its inception in 2006. Thai foreign policymakers have often looked for counterbalancing forces, both economic and security, in the international system to maintain the country's strategic equilibrium and autonomy. Closer partnership with Brics is in line with the country's diplomatic objectives of strengthening ties with the developing countries in the Global South, raising international profile, and expanding exports.\nBrics represents 45% of the world's population and 28% of global GDP. It is a huge marketplace for Thailand. Strategically speaking, as a potential Brics member, Thailand could serve as a moderating force as it has good ties with all countries in both East and West. Being the first Asean nation to join Brics, it would be a breakthrough for Southeast Asia, which can also increase the bloc's regional appeal and influence to promote a more balanced geopolitical environment.\nThailand's relations with Brics can be traced back to the summer of 2016 when the leaders of Asean and Russia met in the Black Sea city of Sochi to commemorate 20 years of Russia being an Asean dialogue partner. On the sidelines, former deputy prime minister and foreign affairs minister Don Pramudwinai discussed strengthening ties with Russia bilaterally and under various regional frameworks, including Brics, the Shanghai Organization Cooperation, and the Eurasia Economic Union.\nIn 2022, when China chaired the Brics summit, Thailand was invited to join in a virtual format. Beijing has made it clear that it welcomes Bangkok to join the Brics family. Mr Don attended the latest summit in Johannesburg last August as an observer under the South African chair.\nAt one point, Indonesia was expected to be the first Asean member to join Brics as the bloc decided to enlarge its membership to include five new members -- Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates -- selected from a total of 23 applicants. President Joko Widodo later revealed that Indonesia did not submit the letter of intent as it wanted more time to study the pros and cons of joining the bloc.\nBrics was first comprised of Brazil, China, India, and Russia. It was later joined by South Africa in 2010, which formed the current name. Its main purpose is to promote economic and political cooperation among developing countries. Lately, the bloc has attracted a lot of attention due to its growing economic and political power, which is driven by China and India. Russia has now become an anomaly because of the Ukraine war.\nFor Thailand, the OECD membership is an effort to improve its economic standards and competitiveness. The Pheu Thai government wants to increase foreign direct investment and views the OECD as a vital tool to attract more investors -- it is about economic efficiency and governance.\nHowever, the desire to join Brics carries more strategic significance, given its growing global appeal amid current geopolitical uncertainty. For Pheu Thai, it serves Thailand's interest to be associated with both OECD and Brics.\nNow the ball is in their court -- to accelerate or delay Thailand's dual ambitions. Ultimately, it will depend on the candidate's economic and strategic value-added to these organisations.\nEither way, Thailand will continue to play out its diplomatic balancing act.\nKavi Chongkittavorn\nA veteran journalist on regional affairs\nKavi Chongkittavorn is a veteran journalist on regional affairs\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhich app or platform do you usually use to book accommodations?\nBooking.com\nAgoda\nAirbnb\nTrip.com\nTraveloka\nExpedia\nSkyscanner\nDirectly with the accommodation\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nKavi Chongkittavorn\nGeopolitics\nDo you like the content of this article?\n16\n76\nCOMMENT\n(9)",

Given the unpredictable geopolitical situation, the region will certainly maintain its strategic autonomy in ways that mitigate the ripple effects of the emerging new international order. The multipolar world will be a new ballgame that Southeast Asia has to grapple with. Interestingly, the region's countries also realise that the competition between the US and China is not likely to subside given the tit-for-tat measures they have been conducting with each other. Under such circumstances, what role or leadership can Southeast Asia provide under the Asean roof to ensure that the region will not be marginalised or weaponised? To be precise, how can Asean avoid becoming a pawn in the US-China whirlpool?\nTruth be told, Asean does not have a common strategic plan or playbook to respond to the most consequential US-China tit-for-tats. Since its inception in 1967, the bloc has been able to weather geopolitical pressure. During the the Cold War, the nascent Asean at that time could withstand the geopolitical maelstrom without compromising the bloc's or individual members' interests.\nHowever, in recent years, the geopolitical landscape has completely turned upside down as the US and China have intensified their rivalry and their bilateral relationship has spiralled downwards. Now, Washington and Beijing are wooing friends and allies from around the world to back up their respective strategies.\nADVERTISEMENT\nTo understand Asean's response to the looming rivalry, it is essential to examine the soon-to-be-unveiled Asean Vision 2045. The draft will undergo final vetting by Asean leaders next year under the Malaysian chair.\nRELATED\nbusiness\nMinor seeks to double hotel portfolio\nopinion\nIs Southeast Asia AI's next hub?\nSo far, the draft reflects how 20 members of the committee tasked to draft foresee the geopolitical situation and understand the far-reaching repercussions emanating from the persistent US-China competition. As such, the trajectory of the 2045 vision on the security pillar will be more focused on external relations than ever before. The current Asean vision (2015-2025) emphasises integrating and consolidating the Asean community under the political/security, economic, social/cultural pillars and its well-being.\nFor the next 20 years, Asean must adopt a tangible pathway -- both within the region and at the international level, to fortify its centrality ethos. The launch of its Outlook on Indo-Pacific in 2019 demonstrated that Asean wish and attempt to play a central role in shaping regional architecture. Yet, Asean must be bolder in taking stands on pivotal issues impacting human and global security, not to mention the four priorities under the AOIP guidelines.\nThe bloc will continue to follow its traditional pathway of non-interference, consensus-based decision making and neutrality. Obviously, due to the nature of geopolitical trends in the future, Asean's decision-making process must be speedier in responding to the crisis at hand. In the coming years, Asean's visibility will zero in on issues that are impactful beyond the purview of the US-China conflict, leveraging the bloc's diversity and national interests.\nCurrently, Asean's code of conduct, known as the Asean Treaty of Amity and Cooperation (TAC), could be a useful framework without power politics. The TAC is a peace treaty among Southeast Asian countries established by its 10 members in the 1970s. As the number of signatories has increased annually and has now reached 51 countries -- about a quarter of the UN members -- the TAC should be further promoted. Its main objectives are for peace-loving countries to promote peace and prosperity. Other useful Asean tools include the Southeast Asia Nuclear Weapons Free Zone Treaty as well as the Zone of Peace, Freedom and Neutrality.\nTo be relevant, Asean must put a premium on international rule of law, speaking with one voice on global issues to augment the bloc's international profile and centrality. Its nimbleness and agility must not be found wanting. Asean can display its centrality and global influence during the year-end Asean-related summits. Nearly all the great powers that shape the world's peace and stability descend on the Asean rotational chair's capital. However, with the current growing tension in US-China ties, Asean cannot sit idly by; it must find ways, using the Asean-initiated platforms, for the two superpowers to reconnect and reconcile with one another.\nAt present, Asean has used Asean-led mechanisms such as the Asean Regional Forum, East Asia Summit, and the Asean Defence Ministerial Meeting Plus to express Asean's frameworks and ethos. However, these platforms are still insufficient to make the US and China forge the regional bloc to engage and deepen cooperation to promote peace and stability in Southeast Asia. Asean, which has prided itself on its convening and convincing powers, should now be in a favourable position to initiate US-China dialogue under the auspices of Asean.\nAdditional Asean platforms can help. For example, the so-called Asean Plus Two Forum, which was first brought up at the Asean-China Dialogue in June 2021 by Thailand, could start small without fixing agendas at the working level. As mutual confidence and trust increases, specific topics with senior-level participants could further engage with Asean as a neutral observer.\nAt the end of January, the US National Security Advisor, Jake Sullivan, made a surprise visit to Bangkok and met with Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi to discuss their bilateral issues and cross-border challenges. The meeting helped to highlight the role an Asean member can play in providing a non-hostile venue and promoting understanding between the two superpowers.\nThailand, given its central geographical location and diplomatic profile, has served as a good host. In a broader sense, the Asean region can act as a fulcrum for the two superpowers to engage in new dialogue to reduce tension and increase cooperation. The year-end Asean summits offer unique opportunities for the two powers to do so.\nIn the next 20 years, in more ways than one, the future of Asean stability and prosperity will still depend on the state of US-China relations. The bloc must do everything it can to promote dialogue and cooperation between them. Asean has the platform and the trust of both superpowers. The bloc must get the ball rolling now.\nKavi Chongkittavorn\nA veteran journalist on regional affairs\nKavi Chongkittavorn is a veteran journalist on regional affairs\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat type of accommodation do you usually prefer when traveling in Thailand?\nLuxury hotels (5-star)\nMid-range hotels (3-4 star)\nHostels and guesthouses\nPrivate rentals (Airbnb or villas)\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nSouth east asia\nDo you like the content of this article?\n6\n14\nCOMMENT\n(3)",

Cambodia is one such case.\nLast July, after nearly 40 years in power, then-prime minister Hun Sen announced that he would transfer power to his eldest son, Hun Manet. The hereditary succession was preceded by national elections that Hun Sen's ruling Cambodian People's Party (CPP) claimed to have won by a landslide; but the United States declared the vote as \"neither free nor fair\", while European Union officials said it was \"conducted in a restricted political and civic space\". Since then, however, the international community has more or less accepted Cambodia's dynastic autocracy.\nLike his father before him, Hun Manet has sought to assert control over Cambodians by interfering in their daily lives. In March, for example, the new prime minister banned musical vehicle horns, which, as videos on social media have shown, encourage people to dance on the streets. Authorities fear that such public displays of joy could cause civil unrest.\nADVERTISEMENT\nCambodians have suffered under iron-fisted rule for decades, a trajectory that began with Hun Sen's ascent to power in 1985. After serving as a middle-ranking officer in the Khmer Rouge, he defected to Vietnam, which installed a new government after invading Cambodia in 1979. First as foreign minister and then as prime minister, Hun Sen worked to strengthen his grip on a country exhausted by war and decimated by the Khmer Rouge's genocidal rule, which murdered up to 2 million people (including my parents).\nWhen the first democratic elections were held in May 1993, under the watch of the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia, Hun Sen refused to cede power, even though the CPP finished second, and became one of two prime ministers under a power-sharing agreement. In a violent coup in 1997, Hun Sen deposed his co-prime minister and eliminated others who posed a threat to his rule. He went on to reintegrate hundreds of Khmer Rouge soldiers into Cambodian society, with many swapping their guerrilla garb for military uniforms as part of his \"win-win\" strategy.\nRELATED\nworld\nCambodia breaks up protest over alleged China military base\nthailand\nHunt on for Rainsy supporters\nUnder the pretext of maintaining stability, Hun Sen's government jailed opposition activists, journalists and trade unionists while aligning with China to extend its hold on power. Last year, Chinese President Xi Jinping personally congratulated Hun Sen on \"winning\" the rigged elections. Moreover, Cambodia's constitutional monarch, Norodom Sihamoni, refused to defy Hun Sen. The king often strategically absents himself from the country to avoid signing controversial legislation, allowing the president of the Senate to sign on his behalf.\nThe family dynasty and its supporters left nothing to chance ahead of Hun Manet's accession in August 2023. In addition to selecting Hun family loyalists as parliamentary candidates, the regime barred the opposition Candlelight Party from contesting last year's elections and viciously attacked its members. The government thus continued its systematic repression of the political opposition: those who stay in the country are routinely jailed, often on trumped-up technicalities and accusations of fraud, while those living abroad have been sentenced in absentia to decades of imprisonment.\nSince taking office, Hun Manet has strengthened the stranglehold on independent media that his father initiated by surveilling journalists and threatening to close outlets that criticise the regime. Most worryingly, he has continued to court China, meeting with Mr Xi in September. This suggests that his government, with the support of a powerful ally, will clamp down harder on democratic rights. The deployment of mass surveillance in major cities, including Phnom Penh, and internet shutdowns further underscore Hun Manet's determination to maintain control.\nThe large influx of Chinese money and manpower into Cambodia also threatens to stoke tensions with Vietnam. Hun Manet's government dances to all tunes. He congratulated Russian President Vladimir Putin on his \"landslide\" re-election, and he has finalised plans for the controversial, Chinese-financed Funan Techo canal, which would allow Cambodia to bypass Vietnam for its international trade and thus reduce its reliance on its neighbour. The project, together with the recent Chinese-funded upgrade of Cambodia's Ream Naval Base, highlights China's growing military and economic influence.\nMeanwhile, Hun Manet has attempted to curry favour with the international community. In a speech at the most recent UN General Assembly, he claimed that Cambodia's \"democratic building process has steadily advanced\". So far, the West has given Hun Manet the benefit of the doubt. But US and European policymakers must wake up. For all their talk of countering a rising China, their passive acceptance of the Cambodian prime minister has given his government carte blanche to bulldoze what remains of the country's fledgling democracy while allowing China to expand its reach in Southeast Asia.\nThe US government, in particular, has numerous tools -- including the Cambodia Democracy Act, the Global Magnitsky Act and, if it passes, the proposed Transnational Repression Policy Act -- that it could use to apply pressure on Hun Manet's regime and hold it accountable for its abuses. These targeted sanctions should be coordinated with countries with similar legislation. American officials can and should bring the Hun family dynasty to heel by imposing sanctions on those who are undermining democracy and engaging in corruption.

Amidst intensifying geopolitics, Asean is in a position where this could either be a blessing or a curse.\nThese three factors will determine the 57-year-old bloc's diplomacy. It still has the ability to help mitigate -- or exacerbate -- tensions between the trio.\nFirst of all, side-taking is not a favourable strategy. Any member of Asean perceived as tilting towards one direction could rock the Asean modus operandi.\nADVERTISEMENT\nWhile each country in Southeast Asia has its own diplomacy, this should not undermine Asean's main stance.\nFor the immediate future, three scenarios can be discerned for Asean.\nRELATED\nopinion\nLike bamboo swaying in the wind\nbusiness\nFinnomena touts US, India and Vietnam for investment\nThe most ideal situation is balanced ties among the three powers -- the US, China, and Japan. Fortunately, two are located in Asia. When Beijing and Tokyo work together, their efforts can ease anxiety and tension among the broader international community, both East and West.\nBut when this balance is disrupted, all possible scenarios can rear their ugly heads.\nSo far, Asean has been able to navigate delicate relations by using Asean-led mechanisms, ie dialogue and cooperative frameworks.\nSince 2005, the leaders of the three powers have met at the East Asia Summit (EAS), which Asean has chaired. This platform has been a space for leaders to exchange views.\nHowever, the other non-Asean EAS members are shaping the agenda through the Asean envoys based in Jakarta. This will impact the EAS discussion on regional issues.\nIt must be said that Washington, regardless of its declining influence in the Southeast Asian region, has now framed the EAS as a broader strategic Indo-Pacific area and is using it to counter China and its growing influence.\nThat may explain why Japan, as the most trusted regional partner of Asean, has now come to the fore. Since 2017, Japan has been constantly beefing up strategic relations with Asean, especially the Philippines and Vietnam, who share some menacing strategic challenges concerning Beijing.\nTo prove that Tokyo is serious, its new Official Security Assistance Program has already two recipients from Asean, the Philippines and Malaysia.\nFor Washington, burden-sharing and using allies as bridges to execute broad strategies are not new. Under the late Abe and current Kishida administrations, Japan has linked the US with key Asean members in both economic and strategic matters.\nA glaring example is Japan's role in reviving the defunct Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade agreement that former US President Donald Trump withdrew America from in 2017.&nbsp;To maintain TPP's gist, Japan launched an alternative called the Comprehensive and Progressive Tran Pacific Partnership (CPTPP ).\nAnother example is the Indo-Pacific&nbsp;Economic Framework, which was launched in Tokyo two years ago. It was based on Japan's recommendations to reach out to larger Asean economies after the US pulled out of the TPP. In response, Asean strongly supported Japan's Free and Open Indo-Pacific framework.\nJapan has been able to take this role mainly due to the high level of trust among the Asean members. According to the latest survey on the State of Southeast Asia by the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute, Japan has remained the most trusted partner of Asean since the survey was initiated 15 years ago.\nToday, Japan continues to have consistent and close consultations with Asean as equal partners. Last December, Japan and Asean adopted a strategic plan and joint vision -- testaments that marked the 50th anniversary of Japan-Asean ties.\nAs long as Japan continues to deepen cooperation and ties with Asean, its relations with China have the potential to improve. This is partly due to the nature of Asean's engagement with the 'Plus Three' countries, which include China and South Korea.\nOne caveat is in place: Japan has to maintain its longstanding independent policy when it engages with Asean. The bloc does not want to see Japan acting on behalf of the US.\nAsean fully supports Japan's vision and action plans, including its Free and Open Indo-Pacific (FOIP), as they are not construed as being born of US strategies to contain China.\nBut the trilateral summit this week hosted by US President Joe Biden, which will include the leaders of two Asian allies -- Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Junior -- could be a new red line for Asean-Japan relations. A mini-multilateral arrangement with a strong US-Japan strategic thrust, including an Asean member, could polarise the bloc.\nThe ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute survey also showed the rise of China's influence in the region. The study, which was released last week, showed 50.5% of Asean members' willingness to align with China if it had to choose sides, against 38.9% last year. For the US, the percentage is 49.5%, down from 61.1% a year earlier.\nNevertheless, the level of mistrust in China stood at 50.1%, owing to concerns that China could use its economic and political powers to threaten their countries' sovereignty and interests. Granted China's dominant economic and security role in the region, the love/fear dichotomy would be an important issue for Beijing to contemplate and manage.\nTo improve the current situation, better communications and messaging of China's actions and policies in the age of digitalisation and social media's echo chambers are necessary.\nJapan, China and South Korea are now working together to hold the next trilateral summit in May, if possible. The summit will allow the three Asian economic powerhouses to fine-tune differences and force collaboration and dialogue. This will help reduce tension and increase security in the region.\nFinally, the most unpredictable factor is the November US presidential election. It remains to be seen how both China and Japan will respond to a new president in the White House and broader strategies. Some recognised patterns or nuances of diplomatic overtures are expected to necessitate level-headed adjustments in their cooperation.\nHowever, for the time being, if both can improve ties and cooperation, especially on programmes and activities that involve increasing the Asean community's integration, green economic development and bridging digital divides, that will be a boon for the region.\nOtherwise, it could have negative impacts on their economies and existing supply chains.\nAsean will continue to respond to the new geopolitical landscape, especially the shifting ties between the US and the two Asian powers. Other tiers of powers that Asean has to tackle on the list include the EU, India, South Korea, Australia, and Russia.\nThe bloc foresees and expects tougher times and unpredictable circumstances ahead. As a group or as an individual member, Asean knows how to walk the tightrope to keep great powers engaged.\nKavi Chongkittavorn\nA veteran journalist on regional affairs\nKavi Chongkittavorn is a veteran journalist on regional affairs\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat type of accommodation do you usually prefer when traveling in Thailand?\nLuxury hotels (5-star)\nMid-range hotels (3-4 star)\nHostels and guesthouses\nPrivate rentals (Airbnb or villas)\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nGeopolitics\nAsean\nDo you like the content of this article?\n2\n20\nCOMMENT\n(4)",

They have said they want to wait for the official results before conceding defeat, even though Prabowo has declared victory.\nIt is crucial for him to start thinking about the challenges ahead, both domestically, but also, importantly, on the global stage. The 72-year-old defence minister is inheriting Indonesia at a time of complex geopolitical issues. Gaza and Israel, the US and China, an assertive Russia, and an unpredictable North Korea. Although the archipelago has always maintained an independent foreign policy, Mr Prabowo will need to tread carefully -- and that's not something he's good at.\nADVERTISEMENT\nHe has remade his image as a cute and cuddly grandpa from the once forceful general, but some of that temper was evident on the campaign trail. In 2019, when he last contested the election, he told an unsuspecting foreign correspondent that he was \"not somebody who is afraid of white people\", and that he wasn't going to be lectured on democracy.\nNone of that vitriol or fury was apparent at his victory parade in central Jakarta on Wednesday. Beaming as he entered the packed Istora Senayan sports complex, it was obvious this historical moment wasn't lost on the man who tried to be Indonesia's president several times before. Many of the people I spoke to at the event were thrilled that Mr Prabowo was set to be their next president. \"He is a strong man,\" one woman to me. \"He will make Indonesia strong again.\"\nIt is a remarkable image makeover for a man with a checkered history. He was accused of the abduction and disappearance of student activists during the pro-democracy protests that eventually led to Suharto's resignation in 1998 amid street protests fuelled by economic turmoil. Mr Prabowo also headed the army's special forces unit, Kopassus, and was incriminated in alleged human rights violations in the former province of East Timor. He has consistently denied all allegations and, in this campaign, has appeared to shake off the past. We must focus on the future, he thundered to the crowd at his victory parade. It seems millions of Indonesians agree with him.\nCentral to that is a sense of pride and nationalism and a desire to have their place in the world. Joshua Kurlantzick of the Council of Foreign Relations notes: \"Prabowo definitely wants Indonesia to be seen as a bigger power in Asia and on the world stage -- to take back real leadership of Asean, play a bigger role in global institutions.\"\nAnd it will be on the international front that he may face the biggest challenges. The first order of business will be the relationship with the US -- which has been awkward, to say the least. He was banned from going there for two decades, ostensibly because of his alleged human-rights record, but Washington allowed him back in after he was selected defence minister in Jokowi's cabinet. Indonesia under Jokowi has been building close ties with both the US and China, and for the most part, Mr Prabowo is expected to continue with that, particularly in terms of courting Chinese investment, which has been a strong feature of this administration.\nThe superpowers' jostle for influence will no doubt be a key theme of Indonesia's future. The country, which is the largest economy in Southeast Asia, should, in theory, be a natural partner for Washington. It is a large, vibrant democracy with historically strong military ties to the US. Its economic prospects are relatively strong, and the archipelago no longer needs to kowtow to either Beijing or Washington to ensure its relevance.\nWhich is why Mr Prabowo's relationship with the US will be closely monitored by other regional partners, especially in an election year for both countries. It looks increasingly likely that Donald Trump could well be back in the White House. Asian governments are beginning to calculate what a Trump presidency might mean for them, and Jakarta should do the same. The combination of a Prabowo-Trump duo could be explosive. The two men, in some ways have some striking similarities. In 2019, after losing to Jokowi, Mr Prabowo refused to concede defeat, saying instead that he had won the election. Oftentimes, Mr Prabowo has echoed the American politician's campaign slogans, saying it was time to \"make Indonesia great again\".\nLike Mr Trump, Mr Prabowo is an unpredictable leader. He has yet to display Jokowi's ability for compromise and political manoeuvring. But Mr Prabowo will no doubt have his predecessor in the background, if not by his side. His vice president, Gibran Rakabuming Raka, is the current president's eldest son, and Jokowi's image has been plastered on Prabowo-Gibran posters. Indonesians voted for two politicians on their ballots on Wednesday to lead them into the future: In reality, they're getting three.\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg\nKarishma Vaswani is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering Asia politics with a special focus on China.

Her grandfather, Prapas, was Thailand\u2019s deputy minister of foreign affairs, and her father, Prapitwet, was a successful businessman.\nThis background gave her a global perspective that she now applies to her leadership roles, Ms Phanavika told the Bangkok Post.\nUpon graduating high school, her mother recognised her linguistic aptitude and sent her to study in China.\nShe recalled her time at Shanghai International Studies University as a transformative experience, immersing her in the intricacies of Chinese society and culture.\nAfter returning to Thailand for further education, Ms Phanavika enrolled in the Faculty of Economics at Kasetsart University, then later decided to pursue international marketing communication at Assumption University (ABAC), where she honed both Chinese and English skills.\nHer career journey led her through various roles, culminating in the founding of her own agency, The Fifth Haus.\nDigiLink Thailand stemmed from a chance reconnection with her Hong Kong friend, the managing director of DigiLink Asia, a Hong Kong-based firm providing online marketing services to brands targeting Chinese consumers.\nRecognising a shared vision, they joined forces to establish DigiLink Thailand as a subsidiary of DigiLink Asia.\nMs Phanavika holds 90% of the shares in DigiLink Thailand, while DigiLink Asia holds 10%.\nGIANT PARTNERS\nThe group secured a valuable official partnership with Mafengwo, a leading travel platform boasting more than 130 million downloads, she said.\nMafengwo\u2019s platform offers a comprehensive suite of travel services, including booking accommodation, flights and tours, catering to independent travellers.\nThe partnership with Mafengwo provides a crucial bridge for Thai businesses, connecting them with Chinese travellers and promoting their restaurants, attractions and services.\nA collaboration with WeChat further expands the company\u2019s services, propelling DigiLink Thailand to prominence among Thai and Chinese businesses, said Ms Phanavika.\n\u201cEven during the pandemic, we remained a trusted intermediary, serving clients who sought to position their businesses for future growth. We collaborated with the Tourism Authority of Thailand\u2019s Chengdu office, becoming the sole Asean tourism organisation to execute a successful, high-impact campaign,\u201d she said.\nThe Chinese New Year campaign via Xiaohongshu, a leading lifestyle platform, generated hashtags from users on more than 114 million posts, said Ms Phanavika.\nSOCIAL ENGAGEMENT\nShe said DigiLink Thailand has secured partnerships with key Chinese platforms such as Xiaohongshu (Red Little Book), which has 300 million users, and Douyin, a China-exclusive platform similar to TikTok, which has 600 million users.\nOther partners include WeChat, with 1.36 billion daily active users, Mafengwo, and Weibo social media platform with 260 million users.\nRecognising the growing complexity, Ms Phanavika restructured DigiLink Thailand, clearly defining operations for existing and newly acquired companies.\nEMPOWERING THAI FIRMS\nDigiLink Thailand has empowered more than 30 Thai companies to expand their reach into the lucrative Chinese market.\n\u201cWe provide in-depth recommendations, matching products with the most suitable platforms,\u201d she said.\n\u201cFor instance, if you\u2019re looking to sell cosmetics to Chinese consumers, we\u2019d recommend Xiaohongshu. We guide clients to the most effective platforms for their specific products, conducting thorough analyses of product strengths and weaknesses, identifying areas for improvement and optimisation to ensure success in the Chinese market. Our goal is to establish \u2018a true partnership\u2019 with our clients, where their success is our success.\u201d\nThe company\u2019s Chinese team takes the lead in crafting detailed media plans, outlining the strategies and platforms to be utilised. The Thai team contributes fresh ideas and coordinates the overall execution.\nThis dual-pronged approach, grounded in the principle of \u201cChinese content for Chinese audiences\u201d, sets DigiLink Thailand apart from other agencies that simply translate Thai materials for the Chinese market, said Ms Phanavika.\n\u201cWe believe in immersing ourselves in the Chinese mindset, understanding the nuances of their preferences and behaviours,\u201d she said.\nWOOING TRAVELLERS\nChina is a market with immense purchasing power and Chinese can travel to Thailand conveniently, without hassles.\n\u201cWhile the perception of Thailand as a tourist destination among Chinese visitors and investors is positive, we need to enhance their understanding of our unique offerings,\u201d Ms Phanavika said.\n\u201cIn my view, Thailand\u2019s future lies in developing every province to accommodate new travellers, not just from China, but around the globe. This presents an opportunity for them to spend their money in our country.\n\u201cWe must showcase our standout products and highlight the best of each province, emphasising cuisine and hospitality. We should plan for travellers to stay with us for four to five days, creating a mutually beneficial tourism ecosystem.\u201d\nShe said tourism opens doors, commerce promotes products, and a circular economy emerges.\n\u201cAs our products gain recognition, we must consider Thailand\u2019s future direction,\u201d said Ms Phanavika.\n\u201cThis chain reaction can have ripple effects throughout society.\u201d\nDespite China\u2019s economic slowdown, she said there is a lot of untapped opportunities in large and mid-sized cities with high purchasing power.\nAccording to Statista, China is the world\u2019s largest outbound travel market in terms of spending at US$262 billion.\nMs Phanavika said independent Chinese travellers spend 40,000-100,000 baht each per trip. If Thailand can attract 10% of this group, she said the income boost to the nation would be massive.\nAccording to Alipay data for Chinese tourists on Labour Day, Thailand was the No.6 destination, following Hong Kong, Japan, Macau, South Korea and the US.\nAccording to WeChat Pay, Thailand was the No.3 tourist destination on Labour Day, following Hong Kong and Macau.\n\u201cOverseas Chinese spending through Alipay has increased in 2024 by 77%. We need to use digital marketing channels to target independent travellers, persuading them to fly to our country,\u201d she said.\nLIVE COMMERCE\nIn the first quarter this year, online retail sales in China reached 3.3 trillion yuan, a year-on-year increase of 12.4%, said Ms Phanavika.\nService consumption continued to lead the growth, with online service consumption gaining 28.5%, including a 95% increase in online travel and a 27.8% uptick in online dining.\nIn China, there are special department stores where merchants live-stream products.\nRegarding Chinese products flooding the Thai market, she said if they are quality, affordable and benefit local buyers, the market should determine whether the goods are accepted.\nDigiLink Thailand brings Chinese brands to the Thai market, said Ms Phanavika.\nMost of the Thai brands with sales potential in China are fast-moving consumer goods, she said.\nFor Thai brands to succeed in China, Ms Phanavika said they need to have inventory, channel partners, and digital marketing strategies to address target markets and leverage live commerce to attract users.\nChinese buyers are now considering products with higher quality, indicating they have conducted research before purchasing, she said.\nThe insight of targeted customers and communication on effective social media platforms to potential buyers determines whether Thai brands can successfully sell in China or attract Chinese tourists to Thailand, said Ms Phanavika.\nBy the end of this year, she said DigiLink Thailand will launch a new platform called \u201cWei Tai Qua\u201d, meaning Hello Thailand, as a venue where Chinese tourists can book wellness, spa and food services in Thailand.\nCHINESE EXPERTISE\nAs the local digital agency landscape becomes increasingly crowded, DigiLink Thailand differentiates itself by acting as a trusted partner with strong alliances in China, Ms Phanavika said.\n\u201cWe believe our expertise in the Chinese market makes us an option for Thai brands seeking to expand their reach,\u201d she said.\n\u201cI spend two weeks each month in China to maintain close ties with our partners and clients.\u201d\nMs Phanavika said this commitment underscores her dedication to delivering results and upholding the company\u2019s reputation.\n\u201cDigiLink Asia Group plans to launch an initial public offering on the Singapore Stock Exchange within five years,\u201d she said.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nIf you were to buy real estate in Thailand outside of Bangkok, which area would be your top choice?\nChiang Mai\nPhuket\nPattaya\nKhao Yai\nKoh Samui\nHua Hin\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nDigiLink Thailand\nPhanavika Limpabandhu\nDo you like the content of this article?\n8\n11\nCOMMENT\n(2)",

06:39\nNEWSPAPER SECTION:\nBusiness\nWRITER:\nKomsan Tortermvasana, Wichit Chantanusornsiri, Phusadee Arunmas, Lamonphet Apisitniran and Kanana Katharangsiporn\n&nbsp; Small\n&nbsp; Medium\n&nbsp; Large\n8\n26\nAn aerial view of the Map Ta Phut deep-sea port in Rayong, one of three provinces included in the EEC.\nThe proposed Land Bridge project in southern Thailand is viewed by the current administration as a marker of its success in drawing foreign investment, similar to how previous governments regarded the Eastern Economic Corridor (EEC).\nWhile some officials discuss the two projects in the same manner, the EEC is operational and continues to be developed, while the Land Bridge is still a proposal.\nThe Srettha Thavisin government needs to balance supporting the EEC as it promotes investment in the Land Bridge proposal, as companies continue to invest in the corridor billed as a high-tech industrial hub.\nCOMPLEMENTARY RELATIONSHIP\nADVERTISEMENT\nKanit Sangsubhan, former secretary-general of the EEC Office, said the  government is prioritising the Land Bridge megaproject, similar to policy advocacy for the EEC by the former government.\nHe said both the Land Bridge and EEC are important projects for Thailand and can complement one another, attracting investment from both local and foreign investors.\nRELATED\nproperty\nCPN allots B1bn to enlarge Phuket mall\nbusiness\nFinance Ministry pegs growth goal at 3.5%\nIf the Land Bridge project is successful it will attract more investment to the EEC, making it a gateway to the global market through air transport at U-tapao airport and sea transport at Laem Chabang deep-sea port to the Pacific Ocean, said Mr Kanit.\nIf a deep-sea port is built in Ranong, products from the EEC can be transported to the Andaman Sea and the Indian Ocean.\nThe megaproject would forge a new link between the Pacific and Indian oceans through the construction of deep-sea ports in Chumphon and Ranong, linking them with a 100-kilometre expressway and rail network to transport goods between them.\nThe Land Bridge would cut shipping time by at least two days, with some ships diverting through the Thai bypass to avoid the crowded Strait of Malacca, he said.\nThe new route would facilitate the shipment of goods from Thailand to markets in India, Southeast Asia, the Middle East and Europe, said Mr Kanit.\nThe construction of a deep-sea port in Ranong will create a comparative advantage for investors who make products in the EEC, offering an alternative route to the Indian Ocean, he said.\n\"The Land Bridge will play a key role in driving the Thai economy in the long term,\" said Mr Kanit, adding the project is expected to link to the Southern Economic Corridor.\nThe project, which involves building two deep-sea ports, a motorway, rail lines, and gas and oil pipelines, should improve connectivity and trade along the Southern Economic Corridor, he said.\nWAREHOUSES\nApart from reducing logistics costs by an average of 15% by bypassing the congested Strait of Malacca, the Land Bridge offers an opportunity for related businesses, such as international warehouses, said Mr Kanit.\nFor example, Japanese companies that want to send products to Europe can store their goods in an international warehouse at the Ranong deep-sea port, with a similar warehouse in Chumphon for goods sent to Asean and Asia.\nThe most likely possibility is the establishment of an agricultural warehouse in Ranong to accommodate agricultural products from southern China, Laos, Cambodia, Myanmar, Thailand, Japan, Taiwan and South Korea to be exported to the Middle East and India, the world's leading importers of such products, he said.\nWhile the Land Bridge is expected to boost trade and investment in Thailand, the project routinely sparks concerns among local communities over its impact on their way of life and the environment.\nMr Kanit said the EEC can serve as a development model for the southern corridor, which includes an education system, community-based environmental protection led by women, private-sector investment in public health, and industrial promotion.\nNEW INVESTMENT TARGET\nChula Sukmanop, secretary-general of the EEC Office, recently said the office aims to increase the value of foreign investment to 100 billion baht per year, up from 70 billion annually, in an effort to upgrade the country's competitiveness via the digital sector.\nLast month the EEC signed a three-year memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission on collaboration to promote investment in the EEC, attract investment from innovation-driven sectors, and knowledge exchange.\nMr Chula said cumulative investment in the EEC totalled 2 trillion baht for the past six years based on Board of Investment promotion certificates.\nActual investment was around 70 billion baht per year.\nMINOR IMPACT\nDevelopment was slower than expected for some key infrastructure in the EEC, potentially having an impact on the property sector in the three eastern provinces that comprise the corridor.\nInvestments in industrial sectors have already been made, and new industries have entered to replace those moving out.\nPhattarachai Taweewong, research and communication director at property consultant Colliers Thailand, said while the slow development is a negative factor, the EEC projects will eventually proceed.\n\"The delay was caused by the pandemic, but everyone including investors believe it will still happen,\" he said.\nProperty developers that entered the eastern market are not waiting for the EEC infrastructure as demand exists, mainly from workers in several industrial estates where many residential projects posted healthy sales, said Mr Phattarachai.\n\"Driven by the China Plus One policy, the industrial estate market has experienced significant growth in the post-pandemic period, increasing by 2-3 times after the country reopened, compared with earlier,\" he said.\nLast year Colliers had many clients, mostly Japanese, interested in investing in warehouses and factories through joint ventures with Thai partners, said Mr Phattarachai.\nMeesak Chunharuckchot, chief executive of Chon Buri-based developer Life and Living Co, said the property market in Chon Buri, Rayong and Chachoengsao is active.\n\"If there is any slowdown, it is because of too much supply launched in the market,\" he said.\n\"If there is a delay in the EEC, it will have a minor impact on the market.\"\nDespite the departure of many industries from the eastern industrial estates, such as manufacturing of internal combustion engine automobiles, new industries, particularly electric vehicle (EV) manufacturers, are entering from China.\n\"Existing drivers like the China Plus One policy will continue to propel the industrial sector in the eastern provinces, but with new incentives the property market could experience even more growth,\" said Mr Meesak.\nFOREIGN OUTLAYS ESSENTIAL\nSanan Angubolkul, chairman of the Thai Chamber of Commerce, said the government has in the recent past consistently prioritised the EEC development project to attract foreign direct investment.\nThis effort was evident as Mr Srettha travelled abroad to persuade major companies such as Tesla and Google to invest in the EEC area.\nIf significant investors from any group invest in the corridor, the region is expected to thrive, creating momentum that will attract more foreign companies to consider the EEC area, said Mr Sanan.\nHe said businesses in the corridor informed the chamber there is ongoing progress on various plans within the EEC.\nOne trend observed by the chamber is an increasing number of Chinese investors in the EV industry from leading companies, in addition to a significant number of supply chain outlays, said Mr Sanan.\nInvestments are also occurring in the digital industry and sectors related to clean energy.\nInvestors from Japan and other countries are consistently expanding their commitments to the EEC area, he said.\nThese developments indicate foreign investors' readiness and confidence in the EEC development projects and global economic prospects as the world gradually recovers from the impact of the pandemic, said Mr Sanan.\nThese positive outcomes are the result of the government's sincere and continuous efforts to drive the EEC forward, he said.\n\"Some people may perceive the EEC project as quiet during this period, but the bidding is already open for various infrastructure projects, including ports, airports, roads, or high-speed railways connecting three airports,\" Mr Sanan said.\n\"Everything has moved as planned, leaving nothing to speculation. I suggest the government communicate more, especially about the progress of various public infrastructure investments to stimulate greater awareness.\"\nIn terms of the Land Bridge, he said it is a significant project the government is working to promote and develop, aiming to upgrade Thailand's competitiveness and economic growth.\nThe government is building understanding of the project with relevant stakeholders, while encouraging foreign investor participation in the investment, said Mr Sanan.\n\"Whether this project will materialise depends on foreign investor interest and their perception of the benefits and value of the project,\" he said.\n\"We need to monitor the progress of this project.\"\nEEC IN ACTION\nDevelopments in the EEC, including plans to build key infrastructure and invest in high-tech industries, remain active, which is expected to generate new economic value for the country in the future, said Kriengkrai Thiennukul, chairman of the Federation of Thai Industries (FTI).\n\"The EEC is not ignored or forgotten,\" said Mr Kriengkrai, also the board director of the EEC Office, commenting on the suggestion the government may be more focused on the Land Bridge project.\nThe FTI plans to sign an MoU with the EEC Office today to drive more investment in targeted industries, develop industrial clusters and upskill workers to match Thai manufacturing sector demand, he said.\nThese tasks can serve as a \"total solution\" for EEC development, said Mr Kriengkrai.\nThe government wants to develop the EEC, which covers parts of Chon Buri, Rayong and Chachoengsao, into Thailand's high-tech industrial hub hosting 12 targeted S-curve industries.\nThe industries comprise: new-generation cars; smart electronics; affluent, medical and wellness tourism; agriculture and biotechnology; food; robotics for industry; logistics and aviation; biofuels and biochemicals; digital; medical services; defence; and education development.\nAuthorities are pushing ahead with the development of key infrastructure under a public-private partnership.\nFive key infrastructure development projects comprise a high-speed rail system linking three airports; the third-phase development of Map Ta Phut deep-sea port; U-tapao aviation city; a maintenance, repair and overhaul centre at U-tapao airport; and the third-phase development of Laem Chabang deep-sea port.\nInvestment in some projects has been delayed&nbsp;because various economic factors changed, he said.\nMr Kriengkrai said factors such as the global economic slowdown and the impact of the pandemic affected the decisions of some prospective foreign investors.\nEVS LEAD THE WAY\nHowever, many businesses continue to invest in the EEC area, especially in the EV and EV battery industries, which are being promoted by the government.\nChinese EV maker Changan Automobile announced earlier it plans to start producing sport utility vehicles in Thailand in the first quarter of 2025 after buying 250 rai of land to build a factory in an industrial estate in Rayong.\nThe Chongqing-based firm wants to increase its investment budget to 10 billion baht, up from 8.86 billion, for expansion from 2023-25.\nThe higher budget is to support land purchases of 300 rai to build production facilities.\nMr Kriengkrai said he believes the EEC has the potential to draw more investors.\n\"The government is supporting both the EEC and the Land Bridge, though the effort to promote the latter is newer, which may make it seem this scheme is under the spotlight,\" he said.\nA man walks past a signboard promoting projects at U-tapao airport.

(File Photo)\nSAN FRANCISCO - Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin is pitching the government\u2019s trillion-baht southern land bridge project to US investors as a way to significantly cut shipping times between the Indian and Pacific oceans by bypassing the Strait of Malacca.\nMr Srettha told investors in San Francisco on Monday that the project could cut travel time by an average of four days and lower shipping costs by 15%. With traffic volumes projected to exceed the Strait of Malacca\u2019s capacity by 2030, the new project will ensure seamless flow of goods, he said.\nThe land bridge project is expected to cost about 1 trillion baht, with seaports to be built in Ranong on the Andaman Sea and Chumphon on the Gulf of Thailand and linked by road-rail and pipeline network. The 100-kilometre connection would replace a centuries-old proposal to dredge a canal through the Isthmus of Kra.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe Ranong-Chumphon project is the latest in a decades-long parade of proposals to create a link between the Andaman and the Gulf of Thailand and reduce the need for shipping via the Strait of Malacca.\nPrevious proposals have failed to catch on, with opposition from communities and environmentalists a key obstacle.\nRELATED\nthailand\nPhatthalung to push airport plan\nthailand\nGovt drawing up bill&nbsp;to get southern Thailand's Land Bridge going\nThe Strait of Malacca&nbsp;\u2014 a narrow sea lane between Malaysia and Indonesia&nbsp;\u2014 is the shortest sea route linking the Asia-Pacific region to India and the Middle East.

(Photo: Chanat Katanyu)\nThe Pheu Thai-led government's decision to acquire a Chinese-made frigate instead of a submarine in the wake of problems and delays with the original purchase came as no surprise following Pheu Thai's intense scrutiny of the scheme.\nThe submarine deal remained in limbo for months after it was revealed that China had failed to procure a German-made MTU 396 engine for the submarine on order and offered the Chinese-made CHD620 engine instead.\nAccording to the original agreement signed in 2017, Thailand was to use the German-made engine in an S26T Yuan-class Chinese submarine it ordered from China. However, Germany now forbids engines made domestically from being used in Chinese military hardware, so China proposed that a Chinese-made engine be used in the submarine.\nADVERTISEMENT\nAfter several rounds of negotiations and assurances that the Chinese engine would be up to the task, former navy chief Adm Choengchai Chomchoengpaet said before his retirement, the navy was prepared to recommend the Chinese-made engine.\nAs it turned out, the government decided not to proceed with the submarine procurement and proposed to buy a Chinese-made frigate as an alternative.\nConsidering Pheu Thai's criticism of the purchase when it was in opposition, it was foreseeable that the project would not see the light of day upon coming to power.\n\"There has been no order from the government or the Pheu Thai Party. It is a solution worked out by the Defence Ministry and the navy,\" Defence Minister Sutin Klungsang said.\nHowever, a naval source said the frigate proposal was drawn up following the meeting between Mr Sutin and the navy. To avoid being associated directly with the party, Mr Sutin reportedly instructed the navy to explore alternatives if the submarine deal could not go ahead, the navy source said, which was confirmed by a source in the Defence Ministry.\nAccording to the naval source, the navy, therefore, came up with two proposals -- one was to buy a Type 054A Jiangkai II frigate, and the other was to purchase a Corvette Type 056 Jiangdao offshore patrol vessel (OPV).\nHowever, the navy already has seven frigates in its fleet, with the Prayut Chan-o-cha cabinet approving its plan to acquire a new one with an estimated cost of 17 billion baht in the 2024 fiscal year.\nWhile the new frigate project is not yet finalised, South Korea is said to be high on the tentative list of suppliers. The navy's seventh frigate -- HTMS Bhumibol Adulyadej -- was built by South Korea under a budget of 14.9 billion baht and commissioned in January 2019.\nAccording to the source, the submarine is essential to the navy's strategic and defence capabilities plan, although the number is reduced to one from originally three. China is obliged to take responsibility and compensation for its failure to fulfil the contractual requirement.\nThe navy had held talks with China Shipbuilding &amp; Offshore International Co (CSOC), which is contracted to build the submarine under a government-to-government agreement, but the firm could offer only free spare parts for eight years and free training.\nIf the government agreed with the change from the German-made engine to the Chinese-made engine, it would have been expected to lobby China to hand over two second-hand submarines to Thailand for training as it awaited the purchased submarine's completion and delivery in about three years.\n\"CSOC never responded to the second-hand submarine request, so that issue would have needed to be handled by the government. The second-hand submarines are part of the Chinese navy fleet, not owned by the firm,\" said the naval source.\nIt is possible that the Pheu Thai-led government will consider a new submarine acquisition scheme after Mr Sutin expressed his interest in a German-made submarine under a barter trade agreement, the source said.\nMr Sutin's decisive role in scrapping the Chinese-made submarine deal has several political analysts reassessing the defence minister and his role in military affairs, particularly military reforms.\nThe S26T Yuan-class submarine was originally due to be delivered to Thailand this year, but the pandemic had postponed its delivery to next April.\nBANGKOK POST POLL\nWhat type of house are you most interested in?\nSingle-family home\nTownhouse\nSemi-detached house\nVilla\nThe collected data is used for marketing activities, adhering to the guidelines of our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nKEYWORDS\nSubmarine\nDo you like the content of this article?\n60\n31\nCOMMENT\n(24)",
