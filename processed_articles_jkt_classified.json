The most significant outcome of the meeting was the adoption of the resolution on further deepening comprehensive reform to advance Chinese modernization.\nAs President Xi Jinping pointed out, reform and opening up are an ongoing endeavor rather than a task to be completed. The resolution laid out more than 300 important reform tasks across the board and overall arrangements for both economic structural reform and reforms in other areas, which shall be completed by the time the People\u2019s Republic of China celebrates its 80th anniversary in 2029.\nThe resolution sends a strong message to both domestic and international audiences that Chinese modernization has been advanced continuously through reform and opening up, and it will surely embrace broader horizons through this process.\nAs Chinese ambassador to ASEAN, I would emphasize that the resolution not only has a profound impact on the future of China, but also pools of vast opportunities for the development of ASEAN countries. It thus will open broader prospects for the China-ASEAN community\u2019s shared future.\nFirst, China\u2019s reform will help China and ASEAN achieve common development. During the past 33 years, the two parties have joined hands to pursue modernization.\nChina has been ASEAN\u2019s largest trading partner for 15 consecutive years, while ASEAN has been China\u2019s biggest trading partner for the last four years. Two-way trade increased by 10.5 percent year-on-year (yoy) in the first half of 2024. In 2023, China\u2019s investment in ASEAN increased by 44.6 percent and two-way investment has accumulated to over US$380 billion.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nThe Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) projects such as the China-Laos Railway and the Whoosh Jakarta-Bandung High-Speed Railway have helped promote regional connectivity and economic development along the line. The successful and vibrant China-ASEAN relationship has brought tremendous tangible benefits to the 2 billion people in the region.\nLooking into the future, China will leverage the strengths of its enormous market to enhance its capacity for opening up while expanding international cooperation and developing new institutions for a higher-standard open economy. This will inject more positive momentum into the development of our region and beyond.\nAccording to an International Monetary Fund study, a 1 percent increase in China\u2019s gross domestic product growth would result in an average of 0.3 percent increase in growth for other economies. ASEAN, as China\u2019s closest neighbor and major partner, could benefit even more.\nCurrently, China and ASEAN are negotiating the upgraded Free Trade Agreement 3.0. With the new trade arrangement, more and more products from ASEAN countries are to enter the Chinese market. This will also contribute to the development and prosperity of ASEAN and the well-being of its people.\nSecond, China\u2019s further reform and opening up will inject new impetus to China-ASEAN relations. The resolution outlines plans for fostering new quality productive forces, nurturing new areas for international cooperation, including next-generation information technology, artificial intelligence, aviation and aerospace, new energy, new materials, high-end equipment, biomedicine and quantum technology.\nASEAN is drafting the ASEAN Community Vision 2045 and its strategic plans, and making great efforts in developing the digital economy, green economy and blue economy, as well as other emerging industries. With more and more confluence of interests, China and ASEAN can align their strategies to explore more potential cooperation in the future.\nChina-ASEAN cooperation on clean energy has continued to expand in recent years. Chinese brands account for 67 percent of electric vehicles sold in ASEAN, contributing to the energy transition in our region.\nAs China and ASEAN forge closer economic, trade and investment relations, more local communities in ASEAN countries will enjoy bigger development opportunities. These multiple economic and social effects will further consolidate the base of China-ASEAN relations. China stands ready to explore more cutting-edge growth drivers and mutually beneficial cooperation with ASEAN countries.\nThird, China\u2019s further reform and opening up will make more contributions to regional peace, stability and prosperity. The resolution emphasizes that China remains firm in pursuing an independent foreign policy of peace and is dedicated to promoting a community with a shared future for mankind.\nChina stays committed to fully implementing the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative and the Global Civilization Initiative, and calls for an equal and orderly multipolar world and universally beneficial and inclusive economic globalization. China will continue to implement the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) in a high-quality manner and promote regional economic integration. China will continue to unleash the opportunities of BRI cooperation to further enhance regional connectivity.\nChinese modernization means peaceful development. China strives for openness, inclusiveness and win-win cooperation in promoting its relations with other countries.\nChina will continue to firmly support ASEAN centrality and contribute to ASEAN-centered regional cooperation and work hand in hand with ASEAN countries to build a closer China-ASEAN community with a shared future to realize the Asian dream of lasting peace and common modernization.\n***\nThe writer is Chinese ambassador to ASEAN\n.\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nRelated Articles\nAssad's fall in Syria exposes limits of China's Middle East diplomacy\nXi says trade war with US will have 'no winners'\nIndonesia women's team reaches first-ever AFF Cup final\nUnraveling the complexities of human security in Papua\nThe future of primary and secondary education under new minister\nRelated Article\nAssad's fall in Syria exposes limits of China's Middle East diplomacy\nXi says trade war with US will have 'no winners'\nIndonesia women's team reaches first-ever AFF Cup final\nUnraveling the complexities of human security in Papua\nThe future of primary and secondary education under new minister\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nMore in Opinion\nView more\nAcademia\nThe bottom-up wave of democratic rejuvenation\nAcademia\nPolice brutality: Fundamental problems in the institution\nAcademia\nFree trade deals increase Indonesian imports more than exports\nHighlight\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEditorial\nNarrow margin\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nThe Latest\nView more\nEconomy\nRI identifies 29 potential nuclear power plant sites\nEconomy\nChinese authorities are considering a weaker yuan as Trump trade risks loom, sources say\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia commences evacuation of 37 citizens in Damascus\nTech\nUS finalizes $6.1 billion Micron chip-making subsidy\nArchipelago\nTwo foreign visitors killed in tree collapse in Monkey Forest\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEconomy\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources\nRegulations\nBullion bank to launch in first half of next year, Airlangga says",

(AFP/Nhac Nguyen)\nC\nhina-ASEAN dialogue relations were established in 1991. The past 30 years, though a short stretch of history, have been a glorious chapter highlighted by mutual friendship and cooperation.\nEvolving from a dialogue partnership to a strategic partnership, China and ASEAN are about to embrace a comprehensive strategic partnership that is already the most dynamic, substantive and influential in the entire region.\nOver the past three decades, China and ASEAN have deepened strategic mutual trust and enhanced good neighborliness. Leaders of the two sides have maintained close communication through multiple means. In recent years, Chinese President Xi Jinping has visited the 10 ASEAN member states and has met with leaders of ASEAN countries many times, steering the course of China-ASEAN relations.\nStrategic communication on major issues between the two sides has been conducted in a timely manner through the multi-level dialogue mechanism, including between top leaders, ministers and senior officials.\nWith our shared commitment to multilateralism, China and ASEAN jointly uphold the ASEAN-centered regional architecture that is open and inclusive. Together, we have safeguarded regional peace and stability and properly managed our differences on the South China Sea issue through dialogue and consultation.\nOver the past 30 years, China and ASEAN have offered each other much-needed support in trying times. The two have worked in concert to tide over one crisis after another, such as the 1997 Asian financial crisis, the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome outbreak, the 2004 bird flu epidemic and the 2008 global financial crisis.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nSince the COVID-19 pandemic struck, we have done our utmost to render assistance to each other.

How to make the world a better place? We need to, first and foremost, understand where we are right now.\nPresident Xi Jinping once quoted Charles Dickens as saying, \"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.\"\nIncreasing wealth and advancing technology take human civilization to a historic high. But the harsh reality is that humanity is also in the midst of daunting challenges and risks.\nGlobal growth is sluggish. Geopolitical conflicts are flaring up. A Cold War mentality and power politics still haunts us. Climate change, food insecurity, refugee crises, major infectious diseases \u2013 these are all serious challenges that we must face together.\nWe also see tragedies in Gaza and Ukraine. What is wrong with this world? What kind of world should we build? How to build such a world?\nAs a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council and a responsible major country, China's answer is to build a community with a shared future for mankind.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nIt was pointed out at the Central Conference on Work Relating to Foreign Affairs at the end of 2023 in Beijing that building a community with a shared future for mankind was a noble goal of our major-country diplomacy with Chinese characteristics for the new era.\nChina calls for a community with a shared future for mankind. We aim to build an open, inclusive, clean and beautiful world of lasting peace, universal security and shared prosperity.\nThe pathway is through promoting global governance that features extensive consultation and joint contribution for shared benefits, for a new form of international relations. This is neither the old thinking of confrontation and alliance, nor the old path of colonization and hegemony.\nEven less, the dead end of compromise under oppression. On the contrary, this is the gateway to peaceful development.\nWe the Chinese people always support world peace for all. This is also in line with the spirit of the Asia-Africa Conference 60 years ago in Bandung, West Java. China never pursues development at the cost of others. A zero-sum game is never our choice.\nWe have never resorted to invasion or colonization to become the second-largest economy. The Belt and Road Initiative (OBOR), the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative and the Global Civilization Initiative proposed by President Xi resonate well with the international community.\nChina welcomes all to join the cause toward a community with a shared future for mankind.\nChina calls for an equal and orderly multipolar world. As President Joko \u201cJokowi\u201d Widodo stated at the Group of 20 Summit in Bali in November 2022, peace and stability are important for regional and global development.\nAs major developing countries, China and Indonesia share common goals. How to maintain peace and stability and protect every individual, every company and every country?\nChina's solution is to build an equal and orderly multipolar world, in which all countries, regardless of size, are treated as equals. Hegemonism and power politics are rejected and democracy is truly promoted in international relations.\nThe purposes and principles of the UN Charter must be observed by all, the generally universally recognized, basic norms governing international relations must be upheld by all, and true multilateralism must be practiced by all.\nChina calls for a universally beneficial and inclusive economic globalization. This is especially important for the Asia-Pacific, the most dynamic place full of economic potential.\nA universally beneficial and inclusive economic globalization is one that opposes all forms of unilateralism, protectionism and decoupling, firmly promotes trade and investment liberalization and facilitation and makes economic globalization more open, inclusive, balanced and beneficial to all.\nFor China, Indonesia and other regional countries, the implementation of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) and mutually beneficial cooperation in supply chains are all part of our efforts for a universally beneficial and inclusive economic globalization.\nAn equal and orderly multipolar world, a universally beneficial and inclusive economic globalization, and greater democracy in international relations are the features of a better world.\nCurrently, China, together with Indonesia and an increasing number of friendly countries, are building a community-shared future. The Jakarta-Bandung high-speed train (Whoosh), the Suramadu Bridge, timely vaccine assistance from China, popular electric vehicles and Mobile Legends, are all real images of the China-Indonesia community of a shared future.\nPresident Xi quoted an Indonesian proverb during the G20 Bali Summit, \"Sugarcane and lemongrass grow in dense clumps.\" China is ready to work with Indonesia to implement the important consensus reached by our two presidents to build the China-Indonesia community with a shared future, strengthen exchanges and cooperation in all fields, promote peace, stability, development and prosperity for China, Indonesia, the region and the world and deliver a community with a shared future for mankind.\n***\nThe writer is Chinese ambassador to Indonesia.\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nRelated Articles\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nMore than 100 Rohingya refugees rescued off Indonesia: UN\nBeyond BRICS rhetoric\nRevisiting Indonesia\u2019s surprising BRICS plan\nThe main economic challenges for Prabowo\u2019s government\nRelated Article\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nMore than 100 Rohingya refugees rescued off Indonesia: UN\nBeyond BRICS rhetoric\nRevisiting Indonesia\u2019s surprising BRICS plan\nThe main economic challenges for Prabowo\u2019s government\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nMore in Opinion\nView more\nAcademia\nThe bottom-up wave of democratic rejuvenation\nAcademia\nPolice brutality: Fundamental problems in the institution\nAcademia\nFree trade deals increase Indonesian imports more than exports\nHighlight\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEditorial\nNarrow margin\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nThe Latest\nView more\nEconomy\nRI identifies 29 potential nuclear power plant sites\nEconomy\nChinese authorities are considering a weaker yuan as Trump trade risks loom, sources say\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia commences evacuation of 37 citizens in Damascus\nTech\nUS finalizes $6.1 billion Micron chip-making subsidy\nArchipelago\nTwo foreign visitors killed in tree collapse in Monkey Forest\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEconomy\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources\nRegulations\nBullion bank to launch in first half of next year, Airlangga says",

On Feb. 22, 2022, I came to the \u201cnation of archipelago\u201d as the Chinese ambassador to Indonesia on a glorious mission entrusted by my government. In the blink of an eye, the time has come for me to bid farewell.\nIn the past two years, I traveled around Java, and set foot on the islands of Sumatra, Kalimantan, Sulawesi, Bali and West and East Nusa Tenggara. From the sapphire-blue sky and sea of Bali to the emerald-green mountain and water of Lake Toba, from the Komodo dragon to the orangutan, from the Mahayana reliefs of Borobudur to the statue of Zheng He in Semarang, I have been deeply impressed by Indonesia\u2019s wonderful scenery, diverse and inclusive culture, kind-hearted and hospitable people and vibrant society.\nThe past two years have been rewarding. Together with Indonesian friends from all walks of life, I have made efforts to implement the important consensus reached by Chinese and Indonesian leaders to deepen cooperation in development strategy, promote practical cooperation and expand exchanges and mutual learning.\nChina-Indonesia relations have made great strides forward, delivering fruitful outcomes from this cooperation. Both important developing countries and emerging economies, our two countries share similar goals, uphold mutual respect and strive for mutual benefit from each other\u2019s comparative strengths.\nWe work hand in hand on the path toward modernization and bring tangible benefits to our two peoples.

In the past two years, President Xi Jinping made the first overseas visit to Indonesia after the 20th Communist Party of China (CPC) National Congress. President Joko \u201cJokowi\u201d Widodo visited China three times. President-elect\nPrabowo Subianto\nmade his first visit to China soon after the election.\nI am pleased to see that our two presidents have charted the course of jointly building the China-Indonesia community with a shared future, and reached a new important consensus on turning the vision into a reality. Our two sides make full use of high-level dialogue and cooperation mechanism to promote practical cooperation in all areas. The 2+2 ministerial dialogue mechanism is in place and will set to inject new momentum into our Comprehensive Strategic Partnership.\nI am pleased to see that our two countries have become the pacesetters of successful Belt and Road cooperation based on the principle of designing together, building together and benefiting together. The Jakarta-Bandung High-Speed Rail (Whoosh) makes Indonesia the only country besides China to have a 350-kilometer/hour railway.\nWhoosh not only shortens the&nbsp;travel time, but also helps upgrade the industrial structure and empower economic development along the route. The Regional Comprehensive Economic Corridor and the \u201cTwo Countries, Twin Parks\u201d move forward steadily and are expected to become new flagship projects of our Belt and Road cooperation.\nI am pleased to see that our two-way trade is over US$100 billion every year. China has been Indonesia\u2019s largest trading partner for 11 consecutive years and among Indonesia\u2019s top three sources of foreign investment for eight years in a row. Our industrial and supply chain cooperation develops by leaps and bounds, a success for both sides.\nI am pleased to see the increasing number of flights and people-to-people exchanges between the two countries in the post-COVID era. Indonesian students return to campus in China. The performance of the folk music ensemble and Xinjiang art troupe from China amazed Indonesian friends. Delegations of Indonesian religious communities paid visits to China. Chinese language training courses are now open in Istiqlal Mosque.\nThe China-Indonesia joint scientific expedition set Indonesia\u2019s deepest dive record. Indonesia is one of the first destinations for China to resume outbound group tours after the pandemic. In 2023, 707,000 Chinese tourists came to Indonesia to enjoy sea views, volcano trekking and delicious food.\nI am pleased to see that our two countries work together closely on international and regional issues with similar positions. In the past two years, Indonesia successfully hosted the Group of 20 Bali Summit and Leaders\u2019 Meetings on East Asia Cooperation as the chair of the G20 and ASEAN. China fully supported Indonesia in fulfilling its duties. China appreciates Indonesia\u2019s support for the Global Development Initiative and its positive response to the Global Security Initiative and Global Civilization Initiative, and is ready to work with Indonesia to take the initiatives forward.\nChanges in the world, of our times and of historical significance are unfolding like never before, and the world has entered a new period of turbulence and transformation. Yet the overall direction of human development and progress will not change, the overall dynamics of world history moving forward amid twists and turns will not change and the overall trend toward a shared future for the international community will not change.\nAs long as China and Indonesia focus on building the community with a shared future, continue to promote high-quality Belt and Road cooperation, call for an equal and orderly multi-polar world and universally beneficial and inclusive economic globalization, respond to global challenges together and strive to achieve common prosperity, the bilateral relations will surely get better day by day. Our respective development goals will surely be achieved and we will surely have an even brighter future.\nAs an Indonesian proverb goes, \u201cMoney is easy to get, but friends are hard to find.\u201d I am glad that in the past two years, I have had the opportunity to get to know friends from the Indonesian government, political parties, parliament, business, religious and overseas Chinese communities, think tanks and media, other diplomatic missions in Indonesia and Chinese entrepreneurs, press and teachers. Thank you all for your valuable contributions to China-Indonesia relations and strong support for the work of the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia, and myself in particular.\nWords are never enough for bidding farewell. I will start a new journey with beautiful memories and deep friendships from Indonesia. And I will continue to follow the development of China-Indonesia relations and be an envoy of friendship between our two countries.\nMay China and Indonesia enjoy prosperity and the people\u2019s happiness. May China-Indonesia relations reach greater heights. May all our Indonesian friends enjoy good health.\n***\nThe writer is Chinese ambassador to Indonesia.\n&nbsp;\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nRelated Articles\nIndonesia\u2019s tourist sector: A new era of innovation and growth\nPhilippines agrees to transfer proposal for prisoner Mary Jane Veloso\nIndonesia should think twice about joining BRICS and OECD\nChina to curbs exports of key chipmaking components to US\nSemarang police shoot student allegedly involved in gang brawl\nRelated Article\nIndonesia\u2019s tourist sector: A new era of innovation and growth\nPhilippines agrees to transfer proposal for prisoner Mary Jane Veloso\nIndonesia should think twice about joining BRICS and OECD\nChina to curbs exports of key chipmaking components to US\nSemarang police shoot student allegedly involved in gang brawl\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nMore in Opinion\nView more\nAcademia\nThe bottom-up wave of democratic rejuvenation\nAcademia\nPolice brutality: Fundamental problems in the institution\nAcademia\nFree trade deals increase Indonesian imports more than exports\nHighlight\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEditorial\nNarrow margin\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nThe Latest\nView more\nTech\nUS finalizes $6.1 billion Micron chip-making subsidy\nArchipelago\nTwo foreign visitors killed in tree collapse in Monkey Forest\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEconomy\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources\nRegulations\nBullion bank to launch in first half of next year, Airlangga says\nMiddle East and Africa\nAirline pilots, crews voice concerns about Middle East routes\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nRegulations\nEY worker's death spotlights India's unprotected white-collar labor",

The past 30 years, though a short stretch of history, have been a glorious chapter highlighted by mutual friendship and cooperation.\nEvolving from a dialogue partnership to a strategic partnership, China and ASEAN are about to embrace a comprehensive strategic partnership that is already the most dynamic, substantive and influential in the entire region.\nOver the past three decades, China and ASEAN have deepened strategic mutual trust and enhanced good neighborliness. Leaders of the two sides have maintained close communication through multiple means. In recent years, Chinese President Xi Jinping has visited the 10 ASEAN member states and has met with leaders of ASEAN countries many times, steering the course of China-ASEAN relations.\nStrategic communication on major issues between the two sides has been conducted in a timely manner through the multi-level dialogue mechanism, including between top leaders, ministers and senior officials.\nWith our shared commitment to multilateralism, China and ASEAN jointly uphold the ASEAN-centered regional architecture that is open and inclusive. Together, we have safeguarded regional peace and stability and properly managed our differences on the South China Sea issue through dialogue and consultation.\nOver the past 30 years, China and ASEAN have offered each other much-needed support in trying times. The two have worked in concert to tide over one crisis after another, such as the 1997 Asian financial crisis, the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome outbreak, the 2004 bird flu epidemic and the 2008 global financial crisis.\nSince the COVID-19 pandemic struck, we have done our utmost to render assistance to each other. Urgently needed anti-COVID materials have been supplied in an uninterrupted manner, experience in prevention and control has been shared, and cooperation has been enhanced in vaccine research and development, supply and production. China and ASEAN are proud to represent an exemplary model of international anti-COVID cooperation.\nOver the past 30 years, China and ASEAN have promoted development-oriented cooperation for our mutual benefit. Our two-way trade grew from US$8.36 billion in 1991 to $685.28 billion in 2020, and it totaled $630.5 billion in the first three quarters of this year. Last year, China and ASEAN became each other\u2019s largest trading partner for the first time in history.\nThe 2-billion-strong combined population of China and ASEAN countries represent a huge consumer market and the largest free trade zone among developing countries. The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), among other trade arrangements, opens broad, new prospects for China-ASEAN economic and trade engagement.\nOver the past 30 years, China and ASEAN have drawn our peoples closer together. In 2019, 65 million people made mutual visits and nearly 4,500 weekly flights traveled between China and ASEAN countries. Exchange mechanisms have continued to expand in the fields of education, culture, tourism, youth, research and journalism. Despite the adverse impacts of the pandemic, our people-to-people exchanges on the cloud have been ever more robust.\nThe special summit to commemorate the 30th anniversary of ASEAN-China dialogue relations is to take place in a few days. It will be an important milestone in our relations to build on the past and plan for the future. Our top leaders are expected to further deepen political mutual trust, enhance cooperation and map our the way forward.\nIt is critical for China and ASEAN to seize the momentum, tap the full potential of our relations and build a closer China-ASEAN community with a shared future for the benefit of our 2 billion people in 11 countries. I believe priority could be given to the following four areas:\nFirst, jointly defeat the pandemic and boost the regional economy. Vaccine cooperation is of special significance, including accelerated efforts to build regional vaccine production and distribution centers in Southeast Asia. The COVID-19 pandemic will not be the last on the planet. To be well prepared in the future, efforts need to be made to enhance emergency response capacities through public health cooperation.\nIn the meantime, China and ASEAN need to go all in to promote comprehensive, regionwide post-COVID recovery and steer our region back onto a solid growth track, especially by keeping the industrial supply chains unclogged.\nSecond, foster new areas of growth in pursuit of common development. It is key for the two sides to improve regional connectivity by better synergizing development policies and advancing high-quality Belt and Road cooperation. China and ASEAN need to ensure the sound implementation of the upgraded China-ASEAN Free Trade Agreement and fully leverage RCEP, which will enter into force next year to shape an Asia-Pacific free trade area.\nInnovation-driven growth also deserves our increased endeavors, and new areas of cooperation might be explored in smart cities, e-commerce, artificial intelligence, new energy and technologies for environmental protection.\nThird, nurture closer people-to-people ties. Exchanges await expansion in culture, education, sports, women and youth, as well as exchanges for our media and think tanks. Mutual understanding between our younger generations is to be deepened further through flagship projects such as the ASEAN-China Young Leaders Scholarship, the ASEAN-China Short Video Contest, the ASEAN-China Media and Think Tank Forum. More could be done also to enhance mutual learning and nurture our shared\nEast Asian\nvalues.\nFourth, safeguard international justice through solidarity and coordination. It is of paramount importance for China and ASEAN to jointly safeguard the United Nations-centered international system and the basic norms governing international relations based on the principles and purposes of the UN Charter. We must join hands to champion the spirit of cooperation in\nEast Asia\nand multilateralism with Asian characteristics, oppose zero-sum games and hegemonic bullying and maintain a regional cooperation framework that is open and inclusive.\nAs friendly neighbors, China and ASEAN need to maintain communication at all levels and continue to support each other on issues concerning each other\u2019s core interests. Differences shall continue to be managed through dialogue and consultation, which is an important way of deepening strategic mutual trust.\nAs an old Chinese poem goes, \u201cThe river is wide at full tide; a strong wind sends the sail surging forward.\u201d I have full confidence that with our concerted efforts, the giant ship of China-ASEAN friendship and cooperation will sail ahead steadily and make greater contributions to peace, stability, development and prosperity of Asia.\nI look forward to another exciting 30 years of China-ASEAN relations.\n***\nThe writer is Chinese Ambassador to ASEAN.\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nRelated Articles\nAssad's fall in Syria exposes limits of China's Middle East diplomacy\nVietnam's soaring US trade surplus stokes new fears of tariffs\nIndonesia to attend ASEAN ministers\u2019 meeting on Myanmar\nIndonesia should think twice about joining BRICS and OECD\nConfronting the climate crisis: Water as a lever for climate action\nRelated Article\nAssad's fall in Syria exposes limits of China's Middle East diplomacy\nVietnam's soaring US trade surplus stokes new fears of tariffs\nIndonesia to attend ASEAN ministers\u2019 meeting on Myanmar\nIndonesia should think twice about joining BRICS and OECD\nConfronting the climate crisis: Water as a lever for climate action\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nMore in Paper\nView more\nOpinion\nAnalysis: Govt adopts mandatory B35 biodiesel program as CPO prices tumble\nBusiness\nGlobal chip crunch stunts Indonesia car sales recovery\nBusiness\nXL profit falls in Q3 as tower sale income dries\nHighlight\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEditorial\nNarrow margin\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nThe Latest\nView more\nTech\nUS finalizes $6.1 billion Micron chip-making subsidy\nArchipelago\nTwo foreign visitors killed in tree collapse in Monkey Forest\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEconomy\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources\nRegulations\nBullion bank to launch in first half of next year, Airlangga says\nMiddle East and Africa\nAirline pilots, crews voice concerns about Middle East routes\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nRegulations\nEY worker's death spotlights India's unprotected white-collar labor",

President Xi Jinping, President Joko \u201cJokowi\u201d Widodo and other leaders of ASEAN countries delivered speeches at the opening ceremony, saying they looked forward to the bright future of China-ASEAN relations.\nChina and ASEAN countries, connected by the same mountains and rivers, are inseparable neighbors. In recent years, China and ASEAN enjoy deepening mutual trust, growing connectivity, robust business ties and closer people-to-people exchanges.\nThe China-ASEAN relationship has grown into the most successful and vibrant model for cooperation in the Asia-Pacific and an exemplary effort in building a community with a shared future for mankind.\nSince the start of COVID-19, China and ASEAN countries have taken the lead in conducting regional antiepidemic cooperation. We have actively shared our experience in COVID-19 response, ensured medical supplies, conducted joint research and development of vaccines, and kept the regional industrial and supply chains stable. We are at the forefront of global cooperation on pandemic response and economic recovery.\nDespite the severe global economic recession and sharp decline in trade, bilateral trade and investment between China and ASEAN continue to rise this year. In the first three quarters, China-ASEAN trade reached US$481.81 billion, up by 5 percent year-on-year, making ASEAN China\u2019s largest trading partner.\nChina\u2019s industry-wide foreign direct investment in ASEAN topped $10.72 billion, jumping 76.6 percent year-on-year. These figures speak volumes about the strong foundation and potential of our cooperation.\nIndonesia is the largest country in ASEAN. The development of China-Indonesia relations has played an important leading role in China-ASEAN relations. Since the start of the COVID-19, our two countries have worked together to overcome difficulties and achieved growth in bilateral relations despite the pandemic.\nPresident Xi and President Jokowi exchanged three phone calls, charting the course for bilateral cooperation on pandemic response and economic recovery. Signature cooperation projects such as the Jakarta-Bandung high-speed railway and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Corridors are making steady progress. Our two governments and peoples have supported each other to fight the pandemic.\nAs of now, enterprises from both countries are pushing ahead with cooperation on vaccine research and development, production and technological transfer, which will make Indonesia among the first countries to gain access to a COVID-19 vaccine and become a regional vaccine production center.\nFrom January to September this year, China remained Indonesia\u2019s largest trading partner and second-largest investor. China\u2019s imports from Indonesia has increased by 6.3 percent and investment to Indonesia grew by 79 percent.\nAt the end of last month, our two countries successfully held the China-Indonesia Coal Procurement Matchmaking Meeting where companies of both countries reached procurement agreements worth $1.467 billion. These fully demonstrate the great vitality and huge potential of China-Indonesia relations.\nThis year marks the 70\nth\nanniversary of diplomatic relations between China and Indonesia, and next year marks the 30\nth\nanniversary of China-ASEAN dialogue relations.\nLooking back, the development of China-Indonesia relations and China-ASEAN relations have made positive contribution to peace, stability and prosperity in the region and beyond. Looking to the future, our relations stand at a new historical starting point, ushering in the bright prospect of building a community with a shared future.\nTogether we should cherish the hard-won achievements and seize the historical opportunities in front of us. We welcome friendly exchanges and cooperation between respective countries and others.\nYet we should also be vigilant against any attempt to disrupt China\u2019s ties with Indonesia and other ASEAN countries. China stands ready to continue working with Indonesia and other ASEAN countries to advance cooperation on pandemic response and economic recovery, resist any external interference, jointly maintain regional peace and stability, and work together to build a closer China-ASEAN community with a shared future.\n&nbsp;***\nThe writer is Chinese ambassador to Indonesia.\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nRelated Articles\nFree trade deals increase Indonesian imports more than exports\nAssad's fall in Syria exposes limits of China's Middle East diplomacy\nOECD warns of protectionism weeks before Trump return\nMalaysia urges Chinese firms to avoid using it to dodge US tariffs\nThe visible and the marginalized: Examining our rule of law\nRelated Article\nFree trade deals increase Indonesian imports more than exports\nAssad's fall in Syria exposes limits of China's Middle East diplomacy\nOECD warns of protectionism weeks before Trump return\nMalaysia urges Chinese firms to avoid using it to dodge US tariffs\nThe visible and the marginalized: Examining our rule of law\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nMore in Paper\nView more\nOpinion\nAnalysis: Govt adopts mandatory B35 biodiesel program as CPO prices tumble\nBusiness\nGlobal chip crunch stunts Indonesia car sales recovery\nBusiness\nXL profit falls in Q3 as tower sale income dries\nHighlight\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEditorial\nNarrow margin\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nThe Latest\nView more\nTech\nUS finalizes $6.1 billion Micron chip-making subsidy\nArchipelago\nTwo foreign visitors killed in tree collapse in Monkey Forest\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEconomy\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources\nRegulations\nBullion bank to launch in first half of next year, Airlangga says\nMiddle East and Africa\nAirline pilots, crews voice concerns about Middle East routes\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nRegulations\nEY worker's death spotlights India's unprotected white-collar labor",

(JP/Dhoni Setiawan)\nT\nhe beginning of the new decade was met with the outbreak of COVID-19. The battle against it has now come to a critical moment when negative and positive elements coexist and the window of containment is getting narrower. The future of mankind is, once again, tightly interlocked in the face of an epidemic.\nChina and ASEAN, as close neighbors, have been going through the test for two months. The even closer friendly bonds between our peoples will further energize the building of a closer China-ASEAN community with a shared future.\nChina and ASEAN have been leading the fight against COVID-19. As Chinese President Xi Jinping has said, China always puts people's lives and health first. Under the strong leadership of the Communist Party of China\u2019s Central Committee with Comrade Xi at its core, comprehensive epidemic prevention and control deployment has been carried out immediately after the outbreak, including many unprecedented, creative measures.\nNotable progress has been brought about so far. The number of new confirmed cases in provinces other than Hubei has by and large stayed below 10 now, and the emergency response measures in many provinces have been cut from Level I to Level III. In Hubei, the number of new confirmed cases in cities other than Wuhan has now dropped to less than 10.\nWuhan is now at the most crucial stage of the battle. The number of its confirmed cases has plunged from over 1,000 in the first half of February to above 100 in recent days and is expected to continue its way straight downward to zero in the near future.\nChina has accumulated much experience in this fight that other countries may find helpful. China\u2019s performance, greatly encouraging indeed, will significantly boost the confidence of other countries to fight and win. China\u2019s efforts have not only safeguarded the health and safety of the Chinese people, but also contributed greatly to global public health security.\nThe Chinese government is taking coordinated measures to contain the epidemic and advance economic and social development. President Xi Jinping has stressed that the negative impact of the epidemic on China\u2019s economy will be temporary and short-lived. The fundamentals sustaining sound economic growth have not changed and will not change.\nWith the country\u2019s great resilience, robust domestic demand and strong industrial base, we have full confidence and capability in meeting this year\u2019s targets for economic and social development and moving closer to our goals in the longer term.\nEpidemic prevention and control in ASEAN member states have also been remarkable. The situation in Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia and Indonesia has been put under effective control, and no more new cases were reported in Cambodia and the Philippines for more than two consecutive weeks.\nThe World Health Organization has highly commended the efforts of ASEAN countries. Some ASEAN members have adopted economic stimulus policies to minimize the negative impact of the epidemic.\nChina has provided ASEAN and the rest of the international community with timely updates on the epidemic in a spirit of openness and transparency. The special video conference of the ASEAN Plus Three (China, Japan and Republic of Korea) Senior Officials Meeting on Health Development was held on Feb. 3 to share information and good practices.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\nAs close neighbors, ASEAN member states rendered China timely and strong material and moral support. The heads of state or government or the foreign ministers of all ASEAN members extended to the Chinese government and people their sympathy, support and solidarity through phone calls, messages and visits. The Chairman\u2019s\nStatement on ASEAN Collective Response to the Outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019\n, released on Feb. 15, expressed ASEAN\u2019s firm support of China and emphasized the spirit of a cohesive and responsive ASEAN community in facing the challenge.\nOn Feb. 20, the Special ASEAN-China Foreign Ministers\u2019 Meeting was held in Vientiane. As the first multilateral meeting on COVID-19, the event highlighted the tradition between China and ASEAN of standing side by side and helping each other in difficult times as well as our deep friendship formed in sharing weal and woe. The ministers reached an important consensus on the China-ASEAN joint response to the epidemic. They agreed to work together in this critical moment and set an example for global cooperation in combating the epidemic.\nIn 2013, President Xi proposed to build a closely-knit China-ASEAN community with a shared future during his visit to Indonesia. Over the years, China and ASEAN have never stopped working toward this goal.\nWe foster good neighborliness and strengthen political and strategic mutual trust. We pursue win-win cooperation for common development and shared prosperity. We firmly stand by the other\u2019s side to prevail over risks and challenges.\nWe nurture close people-to-people ties based on our time-honored friendship. We champion openness and inclusiveness to build more diverse and harmonious societies, to name but a few. These unremitting efforts have ushered China-ASEAN relations into a new stage of all-round development.\nThe joint fight against COVID-19 has made China and ASEAN more aware of the importance and urgency of building a community with a shared future. The awareness itself will be a strong push to the growth of the ever-promising China-ASEAN relations.\nUnder the current circumstances, China and ASEAN still need to continue close cooperation in epidemic containment and public health, in order to defeat the epidemic as soon as possible and safeguard people\u2019s health and well-being. In the meantime, it\u2019s important for us to seize the opportunity and substantiate our major cooperation agenda with concrete initiatives for more visible benefits to the people.\nSuch progress will further materialize and expand our relations, foster enabling conditions for the upgrading of our relations at the much-expected 30th anniversary of our dialogue process in 2021 and inject fresh impetus to a closer China-ASEAN community with a shared future.\n***\nAmbassador of the People\u2019s Republic of China to ASEAN\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nRelated Articles\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources\nAsa Ren, Health Ministry continue work on collecting biological samples\nXi says trade war with US will have 'no winners'\nIndonesia to attend ASEAN ministers\u2019 meeting on Myanmar\nVietnam to build $67 billion high-speed railway\nRelated Article\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources\nAsa Ren, Health Ministry continue work on collecting biological samples\nXi says trade war with US will have 'no winners'\nIndonesia to attend ASEAN ministers\u2019 meeting on Myanmar\nVietnam to build $67 billion high-speed railway\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nMore in Academia\nView more\nAcademia\nThe bottom-up wave of democratic rejuvenation\nAcademia\nPolice brutality: Fundamental problems in the institution\nAcademia\nFree trade deals increase Indonesian imports more than exports\nHighlight\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEditorial\nNarrow margin\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nThe Latest\nView more\nTech\nUS finalizes $6.1 billion Micron chip-making subsidy\nArchipelago\nTwo foreign visitors killed in tree collapse in Monkey Forest\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEconomy\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources\nRegulations\nBullion bank to launch in first half of next year, Airlangga says\nMiddle East and Africa\nAirline pilots, crews voice concerns about Middle East routes\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nRegulations\nEY worker's death spotlights India's unprotected white-collar labor",

(Reuters/Willy Kurniawan)\nAt the invitation of President Xi Jinping, Indonesian President\nPrabowo Subianto\nwill begin a state visit to China tomorrow. Following his first overseas visit to China last April after the election, President Prabowo also chose China as the destination for his first visit after inauguration.\nThese two \"firsts\" reflect President Prabowo's friendship with China, and fully demonstrate the depth of the China-Indonesia Comprehensive Strategic Partnership. We hope and believe that this visit will further accelerate the fast-growing bilateral relations, upgrade practical cooperation in all fields and start a new journey toward the China-Indonesia community with a shared future.\nOver the past decade, our two presidents exchanged visits multiple times, having more than 10 meetings and phone calls. During President Prabowo\u2019s visit to China last April, President Xi and President Prabowo reached important consensus on deepening all-round strategic cooperation and building a China-Indonesia community with a shared future with regional and global influence.\nThe Chinese Embassy in Indonesia and the Indonesian team are working hard to implement the consensus. During this upcoming visit, President Xi will meet with President Prabowo to exchange views on significant issues regarding China-Indonesia relations.\nWe will work with the Indonesian side to implement the important consensus, continue to support each other firmly on issues related to our core interests and major concerns, elevate our comprehensive strategic partnership to new heights and make the building the China-Indonesia community with a shared future more substantive.\nIndonesia, where the \u201c21st Century Maritime Silk Road\u201d was raised, has left a distinctive \"Indonesian mark\" on the Belt and Road Initiative. Whoosh, as a flagship project of high-quality Belt and Road cooperation, has become a landmark of China-Indonesia mutually beneficial cooperation.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nSince its commencing over a year ago, Whoosh has carried more than 6 million passengers, with an average daily ridership of about 15,800 and a maximum daily seat occupancy rate of 99.6 percent.&nbsp; The name of the train, the high-speed \u201cWhoosh\u201d sound, is a testimony to Indonesian friends\u2019 recognition of the speed, efficiency and safety it offers.\nFor 11 consecutive years, China has been Indonesia's largest trading partner, with bilateral trade reaching US$139.42 billion in 2023. Both sides have made continuous progress in cooperation in minerals, industrial parks, digital economy, photovoltaic and electric vehicles (EVs).\nPeople-to-people exchanges are also a highlight. In 2023, nearly 790,000 Chinese tourists visited Indonesia, exploring volcanoes, islands and local cuisines. In the first half of 2024, the number reached around 570,000, making China one of Indonesia\u2019s most significant tourist source countries.\nWe look forward to reaching new important consensus on practical cooperation across various fields, creating more highlights out of win-win cooperation and contributing to Indonesia\u2019s economic and social development and the well-being of its people, thus enhancing the sense of gaining of both peoples in the China-Indonesia community with a shared future.\nAs key members of the Global South and emerging economies, China and Indonesia firmly uphold the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and promote the Bandung Spirit of unity, friendship and cooperation set forth in the 1955 Asia-Africa Conference.\nWe work closely together in international and regional affairs, advancing China-ASEAN cooperation, maintaining peace and stability in the South China Sea, supporting the Palestinian national liberation cause and defending the common interests of the Global South. Such cooperation highlights the nature of the pursuit of peace, development, fairness and justice in our bilateral relations.\nWe look forward to reaching new consensus on closer multilateral coordination, maintaining ASEAN centrality and strengthening coordination and cooperation in the United Nations, BRICS, the Group of 20, Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) and other multilateral fora, so as to jointly advance global governance reforms, showcase the responsibility of major developing nations and highlight the global significance of the China-Indonesia community with a shared future.\nOver the years, China\u2019s growth rate has been among the top in major economies, contributing about 30 percent global growth. In the first three quarters of 2024, China\u2019s economy grew by 4.8 percent.\nWe continue to expand high-level opening-up, being the world\u2019s second-largest recipient of foreign investment for three consecutive years. We are shortening the negative list for foreign investment and have eliminated all restrictions on foreign investment in the manufacturing sector.\nChina is accelerating technological innovation and green transformation, ranking 11th in the 2024 global innovation index. Its wind and solar energy products help reduce global emissions by 2.83 billion tonnes.\nChina is also actively expanding its network of high-standard free trade areas globally, signing 22 free trade agreements with 29 countries and regions. Trade with over 160 countries and regions, including Indonesia, keeps growing.\nChina's economy is scaling new heights and is full of potential.

(AFP/Andry Denisah)\nI\nn 2013, President Xi Jinping, in a speech to Indonesia's parliament, announced an initiative for China to work with ASEAN countries for a 21st Century Maritime Silk Road to build together a closer China-ASEAN community with a shared future.\nFor a decade, China and ASEAN have enjoyed growing connectivity, deepening economic integration and robust business ties.\nSince 2020, ASEAN has surpassed the European Union to become China's largest trading partner, marking the official formation of a new regional economic and trade cooperation pattern in which China and ASEAN are each other's largest trading partners. Furthermore, China is the second highest contributor of foreign direct investment (FDI) to Indonesia.\nIn 2022, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) came into effect, which presented China a year-on-year trade increase of 15 percent with ASEAN.\nAs the two economies partnership continues to deepen, beyond trade, we expect to see China\u2019s growing footprint in ASEAN through FDI, planting seeds for growth in China and ASEAN\u2019s share future.\nChina and ASEAN, as two of the world\u2019s fastest growing regions, are highly complementary of industrial structures.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nSoutheast Asia enjoys strong manufacturing and production capacity, rising and young domestic consumer population, as well as increasing urbanization. The region\u2019s growing trade and capital flows, continuing digital transformation, and greater focus on sustainability are creating tremendous opportunities.\nChina\u2019s modern economy was built on the strength of a solid and often low-tech manufacturing sector, making it the world\u2019s single largest manufacturer today. As China continues to develop and move up the value chain \u2013 toward producing more high-tech manufactures and services and investing in more R&amp;D \u2013 it is likely that some of the country\u2019s lower-tech, labor intensive manufacturing will be \u2018up for grabs.\nIt is expected that ASEAN will emerge as the third pillar of Asian growth alongside China and India. The changing landscape of China\u2019s manufacturing sector will present significant opportunities for ASEAN to capture some of China\u2019s manufacturing, and to become a major source of consumption for the world.\nThe garment and textile industry is the most obvious candidate for moving production out of China to other Asian countries. There are also examples of intermediate-input and other tech manufacturing leaving China with countries like Vietnam, Thailand and Indonesia picking up electronics work.\nAnd as more companies seek geographic diversification and adopt the \u201cChina+1\u201d strategy, Southeast Asia will continue to gain market share \u2013 as well as a greater slice of global foreign direct investment as the center of gravity of global manufacturing continues to shift.\nFDI flows into ASEAN as a percentage of total world flows rose to a record high of 11 percent in 2021, almost on par with China (12 percent). And China has become the joint largest source country for FDI into ASEAN (not counting intra-ASEAN) in 2021, on par with Japan. While the process was partially disrupted by the pandemic, after the re-opening, China\u2019s investment push into ASEAN will continue to thrive.\nMost of mainland China\u2019s FDI projects in ASEAN in 2022 fall into sectors where recipient countries have a competitive advantage. Over the years, China has been investing heavily in ASEAN\u2019s booming manufacturing sector, ranging from the EV supply chain in Indonesia and Thailand, to consumer electronics in Vietnam, as well as Singapore\u2019s promising pharmaceuticals.\nFor example, Chinese investment has been key in facilitating Indonesia\u2019s nickel smelter boom, a key input for producing EV batteries. China-based CATL signed an agreement with Indonesia\u2019s state-owned enterprises PT Antam and PT Industri Baterai Indonesia (IBI) to jointly develop an almost US$6 billion mining-to-batteries ecosystem (Bloomberg, April 2022).\nIndonesia is not the only candidate for China\u2019s FID along the EV supply chain. BYD, China\u2019s top EV producer, is planning to build a production center in Thailand, with a capacity of production of 150,000 EVs per annum. This will make Thailand its first production hub in ASEAN, partly thanks to the country\u2019s generous subsidy which is as much as 150,000 bahts ($4,340) per EV (Nikkei Asia, September 2022).\nElsewhere, China\u2019s investment in Malaysia is equally important. Risen Energy, China\u2019s solar energy firm, announced its first facility investment in Southeast Asia, worth $10 billion+ over 15 years, to manufacture high-efficiency photovoltaic modules.\nChinese firms have also made a move in Singapore. In late 2022, two Chinese firms, WuXi Biologics and WuXi AppTec, have announced a S$4 billion (US$2.98 billion) investment into the country\u2019s pharmaceutical manufacturing, the second-largest sub-sector after electronics.\nThe spreading supply chain across Asia is already resulting in increased capability and production quality in the countries closest to China. Continued investment, the right partnerships and new trade agreements such as the RCEP, will likely bring to the wider Southeast Asia region a degree of the economic advancement China has already been enjoying.\nASEAN has the potential to become one of the world\u2019s key manufacturing hubs. The region has favorable demographics, comparatively lower wages, is strategically located, and boasts production synergies. The opportunity for Southeast Asia countries to \u201cgrab\u201d some of China\u2019s manufacturing advantage is ripe. Yet to attract more global production and remain competitive with China, deeper efficiency improvements will need to be implemented in the region.\nDespite the shadows cast by the global pandemic in the last few years and other market uncertainties, we see the coming years as a period of great promise for Southeast Asia, brimming with potentials ranging from sustainability and digital technology to trade and wealth. This also creates unprecedented opportunities for Chinese companies that are seeking continuous growth and global presence in the post-covid era.\nThe key to unlocking opportunities is not just to understand the dynamics of each market, but to understand how to help businesses across markets connect and work together - from the automotive sector in Thailand and electronic manufacturing in Malaysia to natural resources in Indonesia and pharmaceutical and financial services in Singapore.\n&nbsp;***\nFrancois de Maricourt is president director of PT Bank HSBC Indonesia, and Mark Wang is president and CEO of HSBC China.\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nRelated Articles\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources\nIs Southeast Asia the next frontier for AI?\nASEAN ministers to discuss Myanmar at Thailand meeting, Indonesia says\nRI manufacturing activity sees slight uptick amid underwhelming sales\nMalaysia urges Chinese firms to avoid using it to dodge US tariffs\nRelated Article\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources\nIs Southeast Asia the next frontier for AI?\nASEAN ministers to discuss Myanmar at Thailand meeting, Indonesia says\nRI manufacturing activity sees slight uptick amid underwhelming sales\nMalaysia urges Chinese firms to avoid using it to dodge US tariffs\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nMore in Opinion\nView more\nAcademia\nThe bottom-up wave of democratic rejuvenation\nAcademia\nPolice brutality: Fundamental problems in the institution\nAcademia\nFree trade deals increase Indonesian imports more than exports\nHighlight\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEditorial\nNarrow margin\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nThe Latest\nView more\nTech\nUS finalizes $6.1 billion Micron chip-making subsidy\nArchipelago\nTwo foreign visitors killed in tree collapse in Monkey Forest\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEconomy\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources\nRegulations\nBullion bank to launch in first half of next year, Airlangga says\nMiddle East and Africa\nAirline pilots, crews voice concerns about Middle East routes\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nRegulations\nEY worker's death spotlights India's unprotected white-collar labor",

(Reuters/Jason Lee)\nT\noday marks the 96th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People\u2019s Liberation Army (CPLA). Over the past 96 years, the CPLA has made indelible contributions to the independence of the Chinese nation and the liberation of the Chinese people, to national sovereignty, security and development interests, and to world peace and human progress.\nIn the new era, the CPLA, under the guidance of President Xi Jinping\u2019s Thought on Strengthening the Military, focuses on its centenary goal, marching toward world-class armed forces at a faster pace and makes new progress in the modernization of national defense and the military.\nFacing the future, the CPLA will actively fulfill its international responsibilities as the armed forces of a major country and strive to make greater contributions to a world of lasting peace and universal security.\nFirst, we will unswervingly pursue a defensive national defense policy. President Xi emphasized that China has always been the builder of world peace, the contributor to global development and the defender of international order.\nIt is not in the genes of the Chinese nation to invade and dominate others. The Chinese people love and cherish peace. We take it as a sacred duty to maintain world peace and oppose hegemonism and power politics.\nChina will continue to pursue an independent foreign policy of peace, stay on the path of peaceful development, and work for a new type of international relations. History has proven and will always prove that China as a major country will never follow the old path of seeking hegemony. No matter how China develops in the future, China will never seek domination, expansion or spheres of influence.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nSecond, we will staunchly pursue a community with a shared future for mankind. On the way forward, China will resolutely practice the new vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security, practice true multilateralism, uphold the common values of all mankind, and actively participate in the reform and building of the global governance system.\nWe will also promote an open world economy, and implement the Global Development Initiative, Global Security Initiative and Global Civilization Initiative, injecting more stability and positive energy into world peace and development.\nThe CPLA will faithfully implement the vision of the community with a shared future for mankind, actively fulfill the responsibilities of the armed forces of a major country, vigorously strengthen international military-security exchanges and dialogues, develop defense relations that are non-aligned, non-confrontational and non-targeting of third parties, and promote the establishment of a fair, effective and collective security mechanism and military mutual trust mechanism, actively expand the space for military security cooperation and create a security environment conducive to peaceful development.\nThird, we will unwaveringly maintain world peace and stability. The security of one country cannot be built on the instability and insecurity of other countries. China will, as always, uphold peace, development and win-win cooperation, and work for a new type of international relations featuring mutual benefits.\nThe CPLA is providing the international community with more and more public security goods, including international peacekeeping, antiterrorism cooperation, antipiracy escorts and humanitarian assistance. China sends more peacekeepers than any other permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. It is the second-largest contributor to the UN regular budget and peacekeeping assessments.\nSince 2008, the CPLA has carried out escort missions to the Gulf of Aden and waters off Somalia. China has dispatched 44 escort fleets for the protection of more than 7,100 Chinese and foreign ships, and rescued more than 70 ships in distress.\nFacts have proven that China not only creates favorable conditions for its own development by maintaining world peace, but also preserves world peace better through its own development. The stronger the CPLA is, the stronger the force for peace and against wars will be, and the better world peace and development will be guaranteed.\nFourth, China will unswervingly be a good neighbor, good friend and good partner of Indonesia. Under the strategic guidance of President Xi and President Joko \u201cJokowi\u201d Widodo, the comprehensive strategic partnership between China and Indonesia keeps growing.\nThe two countries have entered a new era of China-Indonesia community with a shared future. Exchanges and cooperation between the two countries in various fields are increasingly frequent and fruitful, delivering benefits to the two peoples and positive contributions to global and regional peace, stability, development and cooperation.\nThe relationship between the two armed forces is an important part of the bilateral relations. Cooperation in joint exercises, personnel training, equipment technology and other fields has become increasingly effective.\nLast November, the hospital ship Peace Ark of the Chinese Navy paid a friendly visit to Jakarta and provided free medical services to the local people. Last June, two warships of the Chinese Navy came to Indonesia to participate in the \u201cKomodo-2023\u201d Multinational Naval Exercise.\nMost recently the Chinese National Defense University Field Teaching delegation composed of more than 50 senior officers visited Indonesia last month. These exchanges and cooperation have injected impetus into the in-depth development of the relationship between the armed forces of the two nations.\nThe world today is undergoing major changes unseen in a century. Peace and development are still the themes of the times. However, we are facing increasingly severe risks and challenges. China and Indonesia should work together to future strengthen communication and cooperation in regional and international forums, and firmly support each other on issues concerning each other\u2019s core interests.\nWe believe that through our joint efforts, the relationship between our two countries and two armed forces will surely move up to a new level, and will definitely make new and greater contributions to global and regional peace and promoting common prosperity!\n&nbsp;***\nThe writer is defense attach\u00e9, Embassy of the People\u2019s Republic of China in the Republic of Indonesia.\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nRelated Articles\nPutin\u2019s India visit aims to shape global multipolarity\n20 years of the Aceh tsunami: From \u2018megathrust\u2019 threat to disaster mitigation\nChina to curbs exports of key chipmaking components to US\nTaiwan's Lai kicks off Marshall Islands visit as China fumes\nPrabowo\u2019s balancing act\nRelated Article\nPutin\u2019s India visit aims to shape global multipolarity\n20 years of the Aceh tsunami: From \u2018megathrust\u2019 threat to disaster mitigation\nChina to curbs exports of key chipmaking components to US\nTaiwan's Lai kicks off Marshall Islands visit as China fumes\nPrabowo\u2019s balancing act\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nMore in Opinion\nView more\nAcademia\nThe bottom-up wave of democratic rejuvenation\nAcademia\nPolice brutality: Fundamental problems in the institution\nAcademia\nFree trade deals increase Indonesian imports more than exports\nHighlight\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEditorial\nNarrow margin\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nThe Latest\nView more\nTech\nUS finalizes $6.1 billion Micron chip-making subsidy\nArchipelago\nTwo foreign visitors killed in tree collapse in Monkey Forest\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEconomy\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources\nRegulations\nBullion bank to launch in first half of next year, Airlangga says\nMiddle East and Africa\nAirline pilots, crews voice concerns about Middle East routes\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nRegulations\nEY worker's death spotlights India's unprotected white-collar labor",

(Antara/KCIC)\nC\nhina on Tuesday unveiled its blueprint for a better world, raised by President Xi Jinping in 2013, through a policy paper on building a global community of shared future.\nChina also said it will continue to push for green development in Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) projects, rejecting accusations that it has outsourced its environmental pollution, a senior official from China\u2019s top economic planner said at a press conference on the wide-ranging policy paper about China\u2019s global vision.\nThe White Paper titled \u201cA Global Community of Shared Future: China\u2019s Proposals and Actions\u201d comes a decade after the vision was first proposed by Xi, and has been presented as his alternative to the current Western-led world order, with an emphasis on what it calls Chinese-style diplomacy and various global initiatives.\nThis year also marks the 10th anniversary of the BRI, and China will host the third Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation in October, with leaders and representatives from some 130 countries set to attend, including Russian President Vladimir Putin.\nBy July 2023, more than three-quarters of countries in the world and over 30 international organizations had signed agreements on Belt and Road cooperation with China, the White Paper said.\nIssued by the State Council Information Office, the White Paper said the vision rises above the exclusive rules of bloc politics, the notion of \u201cmight makes right\u201d and the \u201cuniversal values\u201d defined by a handful of Western countries.\nChina has contributed to building a global community of shared future with actions including promoting high-quality Belt and Road cooperation, state news agency Xinhua said on Tuesday.\nAt the press conference, in a rare appearance beyond his usual annual press conference in March, Foreign Minister Wang Yi said that by putting forward the creative idea, President Xi has shown \u201cthe correct path for the world\u201d, building a strong consensus for international cooperation.\nChina has also proposed solutions to major global challenges in fields such as health, climate change and cyber security, Wang added.\nHe said Beijing was willing to play a \u201cconstructive\u201d role in the success of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in November in San Francisco, US.\nIt paves the way for a possible meeting between Xi and US President Joe Biden \u2013 both presidents last met on the sidelines of the Group of 20 (G20) leaders\u2019 summit in November 2022 in Bali.\nXi did not attend the G20 summit in India earlier this month, missing an opportunity to meet Biden, and prompting the US to say China was \u201cgiving up\u201d on the G20 and building an alternative world order.\n\u201cOf course, we and all parties also hope that the United States will realize its responsibilities as a host, show due openness, fairness, tolerance and responsibility, and create better conditions for the smooth holding of the meeting,\u201d Wang said, referring to the APEC&nbsp;summit.\nEarlier on Tuesday, Hong Kong Chief Executive John Lee said he had yet to receive any invitation to the November meeting. It follows US media reports in July that he had been barred from the meetings after being sanctioned by Washington for what it calls his role in cracking down on civil liberties in the Asian financial hub.\nWang repeated a frequent Chinese warning that China opposes \u201cwanton expansion of military alliances\u201d and the squeezing of the security space of other countries.\nBeijing has been critical of Washington\u2019s continued attempts to increase military cooperation in the Indo-Pacific region, including the Quad and the AUKUS&nbsp;groupings. It particularly disagrees with bases that are being built by the US in the north of the Philippines.\nDialogue between China and the US has been gradually resuming despite continued tensions, with several high-level visits to Beijing in recent months by top US officials, including Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo.\nMeanwhile, not all is rosy with China\u2019s BRI, which has come under widespread criticism for causing environmental destruction in project areas, including building coal-fired power plants overseas despite a national commitment domestically to reach peak carbon output by 2030, and to be carbon-neutral by 2060.\nEarlier this year,\na report\nin\nThe Jakarta Post\nsaid the Batang Toru hydropower project, which is 70 percent owned by Chinese-owned State Development and Investment Corporation\u2019s subsidiary SDIC Power, encroached on the habitat of the endangered Tapanuli orangutan, forcing them to intrude on nearby farms and villages.\nRead also:\nChina\u2019s big firms put reputation at risk in Batang Toru power plant\n\u201cThe joint construction of the \u2018Belt and Road\u2019 projects are carried out based on the principle of extensive consultation, joint construction and shared benefits,\u201d Cong Liang, deputy director of the National Development and Reform Commission said in response to a question from\nThe Straits Times\nat the press conference.\n\u201cWhether the development is green or not, I think the [partner country]&nbsp;knows best, the local people have the most say, and facts are always more convincing than words.\u201d\nIt is \u201cnot worth refuting\u201d the voices that slander the Green Silk Road \u2013 an initiative to make BRI projects more ecologically sustainable \u2013 and those who attempt to smear and interfere with joint projects will not succeed, he added.\nTouting the success of the BRI, officials said projects such as\nthe high-speed rail between Jakarta and Bandung\n, the Phnom Penh-Sihanoukville Expressway, and the Greek port of Piraeus have increased connectivity, rejuvenating the local economy with jobs and trade.\n\u201cIn the next step, the NDRC will work with relevant departments\u2026 (and) continue to build high-quality landmark projects, promote \u2018small but beautiful\u2019 projects, deepen cooperation in key areas such as infrastructure and people\u2019s livelihood projects to achieve complementary advantages, mutual benefits and win-win results,\u201d Cong said.\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nRelated Articles\nAssad's fall in Syria exposes limits of China's Middle East diplomacy\nChina lifts final bans on Australian red meat as trade row nears end\nBiden out of the picture as world leaders meet\nXi, Biden attend APEC summit, prepare to meet\nPeru's Chancay: China's megaport of entry to South America\nRelated Article\nAssad's fall in Syria exposes limits of China's Middle East diplomacy\nChina lifts final bans on Australian red meat as trade row nears end\nBiden out of the picture as world leaders meet\nXi, Biden attend APEC summit, prepare to meet\nPeru's Chancay: China's megaport of entry to South America\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nMore in World\nView more\nMiddle East and Africa\nAirline pilots, crews voice concerns about Middle East routes\nAmericas\nLula 'stable' after emergency surgery\nAsia &amp; Pacific\nSouth Korea police raid president's office\nHighlight\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEditorial\nNarrow margin\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nThe Latest\nView more\nTech\nUS finalizes $6.1 billion Micron chip-making subsidy\nArchipelago\nTwo foreign visitors killed in tree collapse in Monkey Forest\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEconomy\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources\nRegulations\nBullion bank to launch in first half of next year, Airlangga says\nMiddle East and Africa\nAirline pilots, crews voice concerns about Middle East routes\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nRegulations\nEY worker's death spotlights India's unprotected white-collar labor",

Over the past 96 years, the CPLA has made indelible contributions to the independence of the Chinese nation and the liberation of the Chinese people, to national sovereignty, security and development interests, and to world peace and human progress.\nIn the new era, the CPLA, under the guidance of President Xi Jinping\u2019s Thought on Strengthening the Military, focuses on its centenary goal, marching toward world-class armed forces at a faster pace and makes new progress in the modernization of national defense and the military.\nFacing the future, the CPLA will actively fulfill its international responsibilities as the armed forces of a major country and strive to make greater contributions to a world of lasting peace and universal security.\nFirst, we will unswervingly pursue a defensive national defense policy. President Xi emphasized that China has always been the builder of world peace, the contributor to global development and the defender of international order.\nIt is not in the genes of the Chinese nation to invade and dominate others. The Chinese people love and cherish peace. We take it as a sacred duty to maintain world peace and oppose hegemonism and power politics.\nChina will continue to pursue an independent foreign policy of peace, stay on the path of peaceful development, and work for a new type of international relations. History has proven and will always prove that China as a major country will never follow the old path of seeking hegemony. No matter how China develops in the future, China will never seek domination, expansion or spheres of influence.\nSecond, we will staunchly pursue a community with a shared future for mankind. On the way forward, China will resolutely practice the new vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security, practice true multilateralism, uphold the common values of all mankind, and actively participate in the reform and building of the global governance system.\nWe will also promote an open world economy, and implement the Global Development Initiative, Global Security Initiative and Global Civilization Initiative, injecting more stability and positive energy into world peace and development.\nThe CPLA will faithfully implement the vision of the community with a shared future for mankind, actively fulfill the responsibilities of the armed forces of a major country, vigorously strengthen international military-security exchanges and dialogues, develop defense relations that are non-aligned, non-confrontational and non-targeting of third parties, and promote the establishment of a fair, effective and collective security mechanism and military mutual trust mechanism, actively expand the space for military security cooperation and create a security environment conducive to peaceful development.\nThird, we will unwaveringly maintain world peace and stability. The security of one country cannot be built on the instability and insecurity of other countries. China will, as always, uphold peace, development and win-win cooperation, and work for a new type of international relations featuring mutual benefits.\nThe CPLA is providing the international community with more and more public security goods, including international peacekeeping, antiterrorism cooperation, antipiracy escorts and humanitarian assistance. China sends more peacekeepers than any other permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. It is the second-largest contributor to the UN regular budget and peacekeeping assessments.\nSince 2008, the CPLA has carried out escort missions to the Gulf of Aden and waters off Somalia. China has dispatched 44 escort fleets for the protection of more than 7,100 Chinese and foreign ships, and rescued more than 70 ships in distress.\nFacts have proven that China not only creates favorable conditions for its own development by maintaining world peace, but also preserves world peace better through its own development. The stronger the CPLA is, the stronger the force for peace and against wars will be, and the better world peace and development will be guaranteed.\nFourth, China will unswervingly be a good neighbor, good friend and good partner of Indonesia. Under the strategic guidance of President Xi and President Joko \u201cJokowi\u201d Widodo, the comprehensive strategic partnership between China and Indonesia keeps growing.\nThe two countries have entered a new era of China-Indonesia community with a shared future. Exchanges and cooperation between the two countries in various fields are increasingly frequent and fruitful, delivering benefits to the two peoples and positive contributions to global and regional peace, stability, development and cooperation.\nThe relationship between the two armed forces is an important part of the bilateral relations. Cooperation in joint exercises, personnel training, equipment technology and other fields has become increasingly effective.\nLast November, the hospital ship Peace Ark of the Chinese Navy paid a friendly visit to Jakarta and provided free medical services to the local people. Last June, two warships of the Chinese Navy came to Indonesia to participate in the \u201cKomodo-2023\u201d Multinational Naval Exercise.\nMost recently the Chinese National Defense University Field Teaching delegation composed of more than 50 senior officers visited Indonesia last month. These exchanges and cooperation have injected impetus into the in-depth development of the relationship between the armed forces of the two nations.\nThe world today is undergoing major changes unseen in a century. Peace and development are still the themes of the times. However, we are facing increasingly severe risks and challenges. China and Indonesia should work together to future strengthen communication and cooperation in regional and international forums, and firmly support each other on issues concerning each other\u2019s core interests.\nWe believe that through our joint efforts, the relationship between our two countries and two armed forces will surely move up to a new level, and will definitely make new and greater contributions to global and regional peace and promoting common prosperity!\n&nbsp;***\nThe writer is defense attach\u00e9, Embassy of the People\u2019s Republic of China in the Republic of Indonesia.\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nRelated Articles\nPutin\u2019s India visit aims to shape global multipolarity\n20 years of the Aceh tsunami: From \u2018megathrust\u2019 threat to disaster mitigation\nChina to curbs exports of key chipmaking components to US\nTaiwan's Lai kicks off Marshall Islands visit as China fumes\nPrabowo\u2019s balancing act\nRelated Article\nPutin\u2019s India visit aims to shape global multipolarity\n20 years of the Aceh tsunami: From \u2018megathrust\u2019 threat to disaster mitigation\nChina to curbs exports of key chipmaking components to US\nTaiwan's Lai kicks off Marshall Islands visit as China fumes\nPrabowo\u2019s balancing act\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nMore in Paper\nView more\nOpinion\nAnalysis: Govt adopts mandatory B35 biodiesel program as CPO prices tumble\nBusiness\nGlobal chip crunch stunts Indonesia car sales recovery\nBusiness\nXL profit falls in Q3 as tower sale income dries\nHighlight\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEditorial\nNarrow margin\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nThe Latest\nView more\nEconomy\nRI identifies 29 potential nuclear power plant sites\nEconomy\nChinese authorities are considering a weaker yuan as Trump trade risks loom, sources say\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia commences evacuation of 37 citizens in Damascus\nTech\nUS finalizes $6.1 billion Micron chip-making subsidy\nArchipelago\nTwo foreign visitors killed in tree collapse in Monkey Forest\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEconomy\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources\nRegulations\nBullion bank to launch in first half of next year, Airlangga says",

China and regional countries including ASEAN, have made Asian voices heard and contributed Asian wisdom to regional and global governance, together bringing a wonderful \"Asian moment.\"\nAmid accelerated global changes and a lingering pandemic and with the world economy on a downward trajectory, global development is now beset by new challenges.\nThe G20, as the main forum for international economic cooperation, shoulders a great responsibility. President Xi called on all countries to embrace the vision of a community with a shared future for mankind, make global development more inclusive, beneficial to all and more resilient, so as to jointly address questions of the time, tide over difficulties and create a better future together.\nPresident Xi stated that prosperity and stability could not be possible in a world where the rich become richer while the poor are made poorer. Modernization is not a privilege reserved for any single country. Frontrunners in development should sincerely help others develop.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nPresident Xi also proposed building a global partnership for economic recovery and the International Cooperation Initiative on Global Food Security and explicitly supported the African Union (AU) in joining the G20.\nAt this major forum for international economic cooperation, President Xi focused on the major theme of development, reflecting the common aspirations of the international community including ASEAN countries as well as peoples of all nations and demonstrating China's role as a great power in leading global cooperation in the right direction.\nChina proposed the Global Development Initiative (GDI) to join hands with other countries to focus on the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. We are pleased to see ASEAN countries respond positively to this initiative and support the synergy between the GDI and relevant ASEAN initiatives. In the future, China and ASEAN will certainly lead and set an example of common global development.\nAPEC is the most important platform for economic cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region. President Xi emphasized at the APEC forum that over the past decades, robust economic cooperation in the region has created the \u201cAsia-Pacific miracle\u201d admired across the world. Asia-Pacific cooperation has taken deep roots in the hearts of the people.\nToday, the world has come to another historical crossroads and this has made the Asia-Pacific region even more important and prominent in its standing and role.\nPresident Xi took stock of the experience and inspiration of the \u201cAsia-Pacific miracle\u201d and put forward the important idea of building an Asia-Pacific community with a shared future that enjoys peace, stability and prosperity for all, that is clean and beautiful and where all are ready to help each other, pointing out the direction and path for the future development of the region.\nChina has worked with ASEAN to promote the signing and entry into force of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) and applied to join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) and the Digital Economy Partnership Agreement (DEPA). China and ASEAN, both in the Asia-Pacific region, are all practitioners and promoters of economic integration in the region.\nWe believe that with the joint efforts of both sides, the Asia-Pacific region will continue to be the fastest growing and most vibrant region in the world, further driving the world economy forward.\nPresident Xi stressed that ASEAN is a priority in China's neighborhood diplomacy and that China is willing to work with Indonesia, Thailand and other ASEAN countries to focus on development and cooperation and promote the building of the \u201cfive homes.\u201d China, together with Indonesia and Thailand respectively, has reaffirmed its commitment to building a community with a shared future and strengthening the synergy between development strategies.\nChina and Indonesia signed the new five-year Plan of Action for Strengthening of the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership. China and Thailand signed a joint action plan for strategic cooperation. A new pattern of high-level cooperation has been built.\nThis will undoubtedly set good examples for the course of building a community with a shared future between China and ASEAN, as well as between China and other countries in the Asia-Pacific region, and gather broader international forces for the building of a community with a shared future for mankind.\nOver the past three years since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, trade between China and ASEAN has grown against the odds. We have become each other's largest trading partner, with two-way trade reaching US$798.4 billion in the first 10 months of 2022, up by 13.8 percent year-on-year. We have jointly announced the official launch of negotiations on a new round of upgrade of the China-ASEAN Free Trade Area, which will further enhance the quality and level of trade and investment cooperation between the two sides.\nThe opening of the Phnom Penh-Sihanoukville Expressway has taken Cambodia into a \u201chigh-speed era.\u201d With the China-Laos Railway, the Laos dream of becoming a land-linked country has come true.\nThe Jakarta-Bandung High-Speed Railway, the first of its kind across ASEAN, has begun its trial operation. The construction of the China-Laos-Thailand Railway and the Malaysia East Coast Rail Link is gaining traction. The China-Malaysia and China-Indonesia \u201cTwo Countries, Twin Parks\u201d have grown bigger and stronger. High-quality Belt and Road cooperation has made more and more iconic achievements.\nLooking ahead, China and ASEAN should continue to enhance friendship, mutual trust and integration of interests, work together to promote sustainable development, move toward modernization, build a peaceful, safe and secure, prosperous, beautiful and amicable home, continue to deepen the comprehensive strategic partnership and continue to draw new chapters in building a China-ASEAN community with a shared future.\n***\nThe author is the Chinese Ambassador to ASEAN.\n&nbsp;\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nRelated Articles\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nIs Southeast Asia the next frontier for AI?\nPhilippines agrees to transfer proposal for prisoner Mary Jane Veloso\nChina lifts final bans on Australian red meat as trade row nears end\nSantika Indonesia partners with Janto Group to open new hotel in Jakarta\nRelated Article\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nIs Southeast Asia the next frontier for AI?\nPhilippines agrees to transfer proposal for prisoner Mary Jane Veloso\nChina lifts final bans on Australian red meat as trade row nears end\nSantika Indonesia partners with Janto Group to open new hotel in Jakarta\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nMore in Opinion\nView more\nAcademia\nThe bottom-up wave of democratic rejuvenation\nAcademia\nPolice brutality: Fundamental problems in the institution\nAcademia\nFree trade deals increase Indonesian imports more than exports\nHighlight\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEditorial\nNarrow margin\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nThe Latest\nView more\nTech\nUS finalizes $6.1 billion Micron chip-making subsidy\nArchipelago\nTwo foreign visitors killed in tree collapse in Monkey Forest\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEconomy\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources\nRegulations\nBullion bank to launch in first half of next year, Airlangga says\nMiddle East and Africa\nAirline pilots, crews voice concerns about Middle East routes\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nRegulations\nEY worker's death spotlights India's unprotected white-collar labor",

China has witnessed remarkable progress on all fronts, called a \u201cChina miracle\u201d by many ASEAN friends. As to how this \u201cChina miracle\u201d has been achieved, I believe there is something worth sharing.\nFirst, China has chosen a development path suited to its own realities. China started from scratch when it was founded in 1949. Today it is the world\u2019s second-largest economy, the largest industrial powerhouse and the biggest trader in goods. Over 700 million Chinese people have been lifted out of extreme poverty, an extraordinary journey and the key to success is socialism with Chinese characteristics.\nSecond, China has followed a development approach in keeping abreast of the times. With continued growth for seven decades, the principle task facing China today has shifted from meeting people\u2019s basic needs for material and cultural pursuits to people\u2019s ever-growing demands for a better-off life. The fine-tuning of major tasks signifies the change of focus with the change of time and a major shift in the development approach, a shift from speed to quality, from \u201cis it fast enough?\u201d to \u201cis it good enough?\u201d\nMore emphasis has been put on a balanced approach and coordinated development across the economic, political, cultural, social and environmental spheres, or what we call the \u201cfive-sphere integrated plan\u201d. It stresses innovative, coordinated, green and open development for all.\nThird, China has adopted the national policy of reform and opening up. China has made the historic decision of reform and opening-up in the late 1970s, which is unprecedented and which allowed the Chinese people \u201cto cross the river by feeling for the stones\u201d. Adventurous reforms were carried out with indomitable will. Difficulties of all kinds were overcome one after another. China\u2019s development kept scaling new heights through ever-deepening reforms.\nFourth, China has followed the development philosophy of win-win cooperation. China remains committed to the path of peaceful development and the strategy of opening up for win-win outcomes. It engages in building world peace, contributes to global development and upholds international order and multilateralism.\nPresident Xi Jinping proposed to build a new type of international relations, a community with a shared future for mankind and the Belt and Road Initiative, contributing Chinese wisdom to how international relations could be handled and how international cooperation for win-win result could be achieved.\nChina\u2019s development has global implications, as it benefits not only the people of China but also the rest of the world. It also has special significance for ASEAN, as ASEAN and China are interconnected and share weal and woe.\nWe are close neighbors that respect each other and enjoy harmonious coexistence. ASEAN and China respect each other\u2019s development path, respect and support each other on issues of core interests and major concerns, and handle differences through dialogue and consultation. China remains committed in supporting ASEAN centrality and ASEAN\u2019s bigger role in regional and international affairs.\nAs partners for common development, ASEAN and China are witnesses of each other\u2019s growth story and supporters of each other\u2019s development. Over the years, China remains a strong and firm supporter of ASEAN community building and ASEAN integration. And our two sides have grown to be closer partners of strategic cooperation. We support each other in times of difficulty. We came to each other\u2019s help in fighting the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome epidemic and in carrying out disaster-relief when a tsunami hit Indian Ocean countries. We stood side by side to tide over the Asian financial crisis and the international financial crisis. These hard moments have made us brothers and partners.\nWe are champions for shared values and responsibilities. ASEAN and China jointly uphold the rules-based multilateral trading system and reject unilateralism and protectionism. We work together to formulate rules at sea to safeguard regional peace and stability. We champion the spirit of regional cooperation with East Asia characteristics, such as equality, seeking common ground while reserving differences, openness, inclusiveness and mutual learning, aiming to uphold multilateralism and our Asian values.\nConnected by mountains and seas, ASEAN and China enjoy a long history of amity and cooperation and are already a close-knit community of shared prosperity.

Essentially, it serves as both a decade's report card and a visionary roadmap for the future of Belt and Road collaboration. From its ambitious inception to its execution, the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) has surpassed its early projections in remarkable ways over the past decade.\nIn terms of geographic reach, the BRI has garnered participation from more than 150 countries and over 30 international organizations, accounting for almost 75 percent of the world's population. Across the spectrum of its engagement, the BRI extends its influence into a diverse array of domains, spanning economics, culture, and ecology.\nWhether we're talking about the hard connectivity of land-based roads and sea routes, the soft connectivity entailing collaborative efforts to enhance rules and standards, or the people-to-people connectivity in various arenas like education, culture, sports, tourism, and archaeology, the BRI has woven a sprawling network of cooperation and shared gains across the world.\nThe BRI marked a defining moment in China's global involvement, signifying its ascent to a prominent position on the world platform. Throughout the past decade, it has ushered in a transformative era, leaving an indelible imprint on the global terrain and underscoring its far-reaching influence across the world.\nNumerous flagship projects, such as the Mombasa-Nairobi railway, the China-Laos railway, and the Jakarta-Bandung high-speed railway, are completed and operational. These milestones are poised to give a significant boost to emerging economies.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nAccording to World Bank estimates, by the year 2030, the BRI is expected to generate a staggering US$1.6 trillion in annual global revenue, equivalent to 1.3 percent of the global GDP. As this network of transport corridors and economic hubs continues to expand, there is immense potential for enhancing trade, spurring investment, and improving the quality of life for countless citizens across participating nations.\nSince the initiation of the BRI, the aspiration of forging a community with a shared future has evolved from mere conceptualization to concrete action and from visionary idealism to tangible achievement. An increasing number of nations have come to appreciate China's assertion that development is not the exclusive privilege of a select few Western countries, but rather an inherent right accessible to all nations.\nThe BRI has orchestrated a profound transformation on the world stage for five compelling reasons. First, it has elevated the discourse on development to a pivotal global concern. Second, it has fostered an unprecedented bond between China and developing nations.\nThird, it has paved the path toward a fresh global realignment and, by extension, a novel paradigm of global politics. Fourth, it has disseminated the fundamental tenets of Chinese philosophy on a global scale.\nLastly, it has given rise to a novel breed of international institution, offering a tantalizing glimpse into a world order where the welfare of the majority takes precedence over the interests of the few\u2014a truly remarkable reimagining of global dynamics.\nAlthough the initial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic temporarily slowed its progress, the BRI has since bounced back with renewed vigor as the world slowly returns to a semblance of normalcy. This resilience serves as a testament to the BRI's remarkable adaptability in the face of ever-shifting global conditions. Indeed, the BRI stands as a sturdy and agile force, mirroring the ever-changing contours of the world it engages with.\nA curious phenomenon emerges when we examine the spectrum of countries engaged in the BRI. Developing nations consistently exhibit a favorable stance toward BRI collaboration, whereas the sentiment among developed countries is not uniformly enthusiastic. It is essential to acknowledge that developing countries often bear more significant development burdens.\nNevertheless, it is important to note that the BRI's inclusive ethos extends to all nations, with a desire for the participation of as many countries as possible, including those that are more developed.\nEver since 2013 when China launched its magnanimous BRI, Western capitals have been viewing this monumental developmental project with skepticism; their response is tainted by an unwarranted wave of negativity and misinformation. It is quite evident that certain think tanks and media in the West, particularly within the United States, harbor certain political biases when it comes to their assessments of the BRI.\nIt is common to find these studies riddled with allegations of so-called debt traps, complaints of a lack of transparency and concerns about the environmental impact. It seems as though there is a concerted effort to cast a shadow over this monumental endeavor.\nThe BRI is not merely a vehicle for China's economic growth but a pathway to shared prosperity. It aims to bridge regional divides, boost trade, and foster sustainable development across Asia, Europe, Latin America and Africa.\nFrom 2013 to 2022, China's trade with BRI participant nations has surged to a whopping $19.1 trillion, marked by an annual growth rate averaging 6.4 percent. Impressively, the cumulative two-way investment between China and its partner countries has reached $380 billion, with China contributing $240 billion, as revealed in the white paper.\nThese numbers illuminate the transformative impact of the BRI, both as a catalyst for trade and as a source of significant investment in the participating nations, underscoring its pivotal role in shaping global economic dynamics.\nThe future of BRI cooperation is rich with possibilities. As highlighted in the white paper, the BRI is a profound, long-term, and systematic global endeavor of the 21st century, and it has embarked on an enduring journey. The original framework of BRI, while primarily focusing on partnerships with developing nations, has become the bedrock upon which the Global Development Initiative, Global Security Initiative, and Global Civilization Initiative have flourished.\nThese progressive offshoots represent an intentional expansion of the initial vision, offering a wide array of dynamic approaches to fortify global development and the accomplishments of the BRI.\nAs traditional infrastructure projects persist, the rising prominence of digital connectivity is set to drive substantial demand for digital infrastructure across the region. This digital frontier is poised to assume a central role in the next phase of BRI implementation.\nConcurrently, the green and blue economies are poised to emerge as twin drivers. These multifaceted developments paint a promising picture for growth, collaboration and shared prosperity.\n&nbsp;***\nThe writer is an international affairs observer based in Karachi.\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nRelated Articles\nGovt expects Apple to up investment commitment to $1 billion\nGovt halts big infrastructure in trade-off for food security: Minister\nMeaningful digital transformation for the Asia-Pacific region\nFor Indonesia, Trumponomics will be another headwind\nLiquidity challenges and growth expectations in the new government era\nRelated Article\nGovt expects Apple to up investment commitment to $1 billion\nGovt halts big infrastructure in trade-off for food security: Minister\nMeaningful digital transformation for the Asia-Pacific region\nFor Indonesia, Trumponomics will be another headwind\nLiquidity challenges and growth expectations in the new government era\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nMore in Opinion\nView more\nAcademia\nThe bottom-up wave of democratic rejuvenation\nAcademia\nPolice brutality: Fundamental problems in the institution\nAcademia\nFree trade deals increase Indonesian imports more than exports\nHighlight\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEditorial\nNarrow margin\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nThe Latest\nView more\nTech\nUS finalizes $6.1 billion Micron chip-making subsidy\nArchipelago\nTwo foreign visitors killed in tree collapse in Monkey Forest\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEconomy\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources\nRegulations\nBullion bank to launch in first half of next year, Airlangga says\nMiddle East and Africa\nAirline pilots, crews voice concerns about Middle East routes\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nRegulations\nEY worker's death spotlights India's unprotected white-collar labor",

In a press briefing, Ambassador Hou discussed the progress of China-ASEAN cooperation in various fields, as well as expectations for the upcoming leaders\u2019 meetings on East Asia Cooperation.\nShe opened the meeting by expressing her support for Indonesia as the ASEAN chair this year and stated that she expects continuous cooperation and a deepened relationship between China and member countries, which she hopes will be further discussed at the summit planned for September.\nIn line with the theme chosen by Indonesia, \u201cASEAN Matters: Epicentrum of Growth,\" Hou expects the meetings to focus on dialogue and cooperation to promote development and prosperity and therefore bring more stability and certainty about what the future holds.\nFurthermore, she reiterated President Xi Jinping's proposal of jointly building a peaceful, safe and secure, prosperous, beautiful and amicable environment, evidenced by China\u2019s move to promote the Southeast Asia Nuclear Weapon-Free Zone (SEANWFZ).\nThe ambassador informed the media of the long diplomatic history between China and ASEAN member countries, especially through frequent high-level exchanges. China and ASEAN organized grand commemorative activities to mark the 20\nth\nanniversary of China\u2019s accession to the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation in Southeast Asia (TAC), in order to continue to jointly uphold and promote the TAC spirit and safeguard lasting peace in the region.\nAmbassador Hou also gave a comprehensive introduction to China's support for ASEAN's community building in the three pillars of the ASEAN Socio-Cultural Community (ASCC), the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) and the ASEAN Political-Security Community (APSC) that were first created to ensure more equity and harmony in the region.\nChina has been a partner of several member countries in areas such as growth and has formed partnerships in the fields of new energy, the digital economy and science and technology innovation through both state-owned and local companies in the region. China has vigorously promoted exchanges and cooperation with ASEAN in education, science and technology, culture, youth, poverty reduction and tourism.\nWhile bringing the event to a close, she introduced the Global Development Initiative (GDI), the Global Security Initiative (GSI) and the Global Civilization Initiative (GSI) proposed by President Xi, stressing China's willingness to work with ASEAN countries to build a tighter-knit community with a shared future.\nShe also highlighted the organizations shared between ASEAN and China, such as the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and the ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific (AOIP), reiterating the mutual benefits that are enjoyed by Indonesia and China in both projects.\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nRelated Articles\nTrump names New York Rep.

This was President Xi Jinping\u2019s farsighted initiative for us to revisit these principles and how they are still useful in facing future challenges.\nThe Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence was a seminal proposal by Zhou Enlai and Jawaharlal Nehru, the respective prime ministers of China and India at the time. The fundamental tenet of this proposal is mutual respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all parties involved.\nFurthermore, it calls for a mutual nonaggression, noninterference in each other's internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit. Finally, it advocates for peaceful coexistence.\nThese enlightened principles encapsulated the wisdom of the two world's greatest and most ancient civilizations.\nThis year we also celebrate the 11th anniversary since China introduced the concept of Building a Community with a Shared Future for Mankind, which was first articulated by President Xi in 2013 and represents a modern approach to global governance and cooperation.\nIt emphasizes the interconnection of nations in an increasingly globalized world and advocates mutual respect, mutual benefit and win-win cooperation.

(Presidential Palace Press Bureau/Laily Rachev)\nC\nhina has increasingly become the center of attention on the world stage in recent years. In my decades-long interactions with friends and colleagues from the ASEAN family, I could always find heart-warming friendliness but also uncertainty about China from time to time, which is, unfortunately, exacerbated recently by the misleading smearing of China by a few Western politicians.\nA question of common interest thus emerges: Where is China\u2019s foreign policy heading and what is it aiming for?\nThe Xi Jinping Thought on Diplomacy doctrine would be the most authoritative answer to this question. Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC), the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core has put forward a series of new ideas, new propositions and new initiatives, pointing the direction and providing fundamental guidance for China\u2019s foreign policy.\nChina is committed to building a community with a shared future for mankind, which is the essence of Xi Jinping Thought on Diplomacy.\nPresident Xi points out, \u201cHumankind, by living in the same global village within the same time and space where history and reality meet, has increasingly emerged as an intimate community of shared future. No country could meet the challenges for mankind alone.\u201d\nThe foresight of this vision is once again proved to be true in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.\nTo build a community with a shared future for mankind is the goal of China\u2019s foreign policy. Toward this end, China has been working hard all along, and the most recent effort would be our engagement in international cooperation against COVID-19. As far as ASEAN is concerned, China provided COVID-19-related information in a timely manner, shared experience in control and treatment, and offered a large number of medical supplies.\nThe revival of the regional economy as soon as possible presents another daunting challenge of the day. China has opened or is planning to open \u201cfast-track lanes\u201d for essential personnel exchanges and \u201cgreen channels\u201d for cargo transportation with Singapore, Myanmar, Indonesia and Malaysia. China and ASEAN countries are also jointly working on COVID-19 vaccine research and development, as well as production. It\u2019s good to know that phase III clinical trials of a vaccine developed in China was rolled out in Indonesia days ago.\nChina is committed to the path of peaceful development. There are people in the West who apply the \u201cThucydides Trap\u201d or \u201cKindleberger Trap\u201d to interpret China\u2019s rapid development. Trapped in the belief that \u201ca strong country must seek hegemony\u201d, they demonize China as a potential danger to the world.\nOn the contrary, the Chinese culture holds dear harmony and unity; harmony being the most valuable and harmony without uniformity. Invasion and hegemony-seeking have never been in the Chinese DNA. Facts still speak louder than words. For instance, China\u2019s military expenditure was an average of 1.3 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in the last 10 years, lower than the world average.\nChina has always been dedicated to resolving disputes through negotiations in peace while safeguarding China\u2019s territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests. Guided by the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the spirit of fostering amity and friendship with neighbors, China has properly solved most of the leftover boundary issues step by step with neighboring countries in the past seven decades, and the delineated boundary is about 90 percent of China\u2019s total boundary on land.\nRegarding disputes over the South China Sea, China remains committed to the \u201cdual-track\u201d approach of resolving disputes peacefully through consultation and negotiation between countries directly concerned and of upholding peace and stability in the South China Sea by China and ASEAN countries through joint efforts, including regional rules-making.\nIn 2013, President Xi put forward the major initiatives of the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road, which later turned into the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). It focuses on economic cooperation, rather than geopolitical alliance. It is open and inclusive and rests upon extensive consultation, joint contribution and shared benefits.\nSix years on, the initiative is materializing and has become one of the most popular global public goods. It is exciting to see flourishing BRI cooperation between China and ASEAN countries in infrastructure, energy, manufacturing, industrial parks and more. Such cooperation has already delivered real dividends to local development and people.\nPopulism, protectionism, unilateralism and antiglobalization sentiments are proliferating now. Certain countries attribute their domestic problems to external shocks, claiming that they have been \u201ctaken advantage of \u201d in the existing trading system. They adopt various measures, including trade, to suppress the development of others, even willfully withdrawing from international treaties and organizations and scapegoating others. Their behavior has seriously violated the multilateral trading system.\nYet despite this, as a firm defender of economic globalization and multilateral trading system, China continues to promote trade and investment liberalization and facilitation, a fair, equitable and transparent system of international economic and trading rules, as well as a more open, connected and integrated global economy.\nThe existing international system was established after World War II under the leadership of United States-led Western countries. Despite its deficiencies and drawbacks, it has played an important role in maintaining world peace and development over the past 70 years. The purpose of reforming the current international system is not to overturn it and start anew, but to adjust and improve it within the overall framework and to make it better adapted to the evolved international landscape.\nChina firmly safeguards the core role of the United Nations in global governance and promotes the building of a more just and equitable international governance system. China honors its commitments on global issues such as climate change by staying on course of green, low-carbon and sustainable development.\nChina will do well only when the world does well and vice versa. On our way toward a community with a shared future, China will work together with ASEAN countries and all other countries in the world to eradicate poverty and seek prosperity and development, to end conflicts and uphold peace, and to bridge the gap between civilizations through exchanges and mutual learning. Together we march toward a better world for all!\n---\nAmbassador of the People\u2019s Republic of China to ASEAN\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nRelated Articles\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources\nGive the new FM time\nAnalysis: Jokowi, Prabowo allies dominate key regional races\nRuling coalition outclasses opposition\n'Decisive' victory for ruling coalition\nRelated Article\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources\nGive the new FM time\nAnalysis: Jokowi, Prabowo allies dominate key regional races\nRuling coalition outclasses opposition\n'Decisive' victory for ruling coalition\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nMore in Academia\nView more\nAcademia\nThe bottom-up wave of democratic rejuvenation\nAcademia\nPolice brutality: Fundamental problems in the institution\nAcademia\nFree trade deals increase Indonesian imports more than exports\nHighlight\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEditorial\nNarrow margin\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nThe Latest\nView more\nEconomy\nRI identifies 29 potential nuclear power plant sites\nEconomy\nChinese authorities are considering a weaker yuan as Trump trade risks loom, sources say\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia commences evacuation of 37 citizens in Damascus\nTech\nUS finalizes $6.1 billion Micron chip-making subsidy\nArchipelago\nTwo foreign visitors killed in tree collapse in Monkey Forest\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEconomy\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources\nRegulations\nBullion bank to launch in first half of next year, Airlangga says",

(AFP/Handout)\nL\neaders\u2019 meetings on East Asian Cooperation were successfully held in Phnom Penh recently. During the meetings, China and ASEAN fully displayed their mutually shared spirit of openness and cooperation, sending once again a strong message of East Asian cooperation.\nSince the establishment of the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership in November last year, China and ASEAN have focused on the building of a peaceful, safe and secure, prosperous, beautiful and amicable home proposed by President Xi Jinping, deepened strategic cooperation, promoted connectivity, pursued common development and consolidated people-to-people ties.\nWe have not only opened a brand-new chapter in China-ASEAN relations, but also played strong leading and driving roles in East Asian cooperation.\nDuring the meetings, China and ASEAN reviewed the important progress achieved in implementing the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership, conducted in-depth exchanges on promoting trade and investment liberalization and facilitation, advancing new-type industrialization and agricultural modernization, accelerating digital and green transformation, building a stronger shield for public health security, enhancing coordination on multilateral governance of development and putting forward many concrete initiatives and measures.\nThe two sides once again demonstrated with actions that openness and cooperation are the right way to deal with the complicated situation, and the common choice of China and ASEAN as well.\nTo uphold openness and cooperation, we need to forge a stronger consensus on cooperation. The 20\nth\nNational Congress of the Communist Party of China not long ago reiterated that China will keep to its foreign-policy goals of upholding world peace and promoting common development; remain committed to an independent foreign policy of peace, to peaceful development and to the fundamental national policy of opening-up; and work to grow in friendship and cooperation with all countries.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nASEAN is a high priority in China\u2019s neighborhood diplomacy, and also a comprehensive strategic partner sharing the same future with China. Modernization and achieving a better life for our people is a goal we are both working hard to maintain.\nChina looks forward to working with ASEAN to continuously enhance friendship, deepen mutual trust and expand common interests. We need to stay focused on development and cooperation, embrace opportunities, meet challenges and build a closer China-ASEAN community with a shared future.\nTo uphold openness and cooperation, we need to focus on common development. Global challenges require global responses. All parties need to put development first, synergize development strategies and take collective actions to fully unleash the development and cooperation potential of East Asia and provide a solid foundation for addressing post-pandemic recovery, climate change and other challenges as well as achieving sustainable development.\nChina and ASEAN will continue to promote the implementation of the Global Development Initiative. In pursuing high-quality Belt and Road cooperation, we may promote the mutually beneficial cooperation between the Belt and Road Initiative and the ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific.\nOur cooperation may center on the following lines of efforts, namely trade and investment liberalization and facilitation, new-type industrialization, digitization, low-carbon development, agricultural modernization, etc.\nWe need to further tap the potential of cooperation; upgrade cooperation mechanisms and raise our collective competitiveness so as to realize the common development of 2 billion people in China and ASEAN; and contribute to peace, stability and prosperity of the region and the world.\nTo uphold openness and cooperation, we must have firm confidence in cooperation. In the face of complicated and complex international situations and surging risks and challenges, East Asian cooperation has been able to maintain a good momentum of steady development in general, an important reason of which is the formation of a multi-tiered and inter-connected architecture of regional cooperation.\nAnd the key to the success of this architecture is that it upholds ASEAN centrality, accommodates the interests of all parties and conforms to the regional reality.\nWe believe that as long as all parties sincerely support ASEAN centrality in East Asian cooperation, uphold the ASEAN way that maintains mutual respect and dialogue and consultation, support the ASEAN-led cooperation model that features mutually beneficial and win-win cooperation, and support the expanding and strengthening of the ASEAN-led regional architecture that is open and inclusive, East Asian cooperation will be able to stay strong and sustainable.\nIn the current situation, we should still have such confidence.\n&nbsp;***\nThe writer is Chinese Ambassador to ASEAN.\n&nbsp;\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nRelated Articles\nChina to curbs exports of key chipmaking components to US\nPhilippine president says Russian submarine in South China Sea 'worrisome'\nPrabowo calls for free, fair trade at APEC\nNo more cop-outs\nGermany bets on India to reduce reliance on China\nRelated Article\nChina to curbs exports of key chipmaking components to US\nPhilippine president says Russian submarine in South China Sea 'worrisome'\nPrabowo calls for free, fair trade at APEC\nNo more cop-outs\nGermany bets on India to reduce reliance on China\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nMore in Opinion\nView more\nAcademia\nThe bottom-up wave of democratic rejuvenation\nAcademia\nPolice brutality: Fundamental problems in the institution\nAcademia\nFree trade deals increase Indonesian imports more than exports\nHighlight\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEditorial\nNarrow margin\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nThe Latest\nView more\nEconomy\nRI identifies 29 potential nuclear power plant sites\nEconomy\nChinese authorities are considering a weaker yuan as Trump trade risks loom, sources say\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia commences evacuation of 37 citizens in Damascus\nTech\nUS finalizes $6.1 billion Micron chip-making subsidy\nArchipelago\nTwo foreign visitors killed in tree collapse in Monkey Forest\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEconomy\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources\nRegulations\nBullion bank to launch in first half of next year, Airlangga says",

(Reuters/Florence Lo)\nP\nresident\nPrabowo Subianto\n\u2019s inaugural visit to China underscores a pivot toward great power diplomacy, a strategic approach that may mark a significant departure from Indonesia\u2019s traditional stance more closely resembling what is now referred to and discussed as \u201cmiddle power diplomacy.\u201d\nOver the weekend, Prabowo met with key Chinese leaders, including Zhao Leji, chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Premier Li Qiang, and finally, President Xi Jinping. The visit yielded several notable agreements, such as a US$10 billion investment pledge between the countries and several memorandums of understanding related to water conservation, the blue economy and maritime resources, and mining.\nThe joint statement issued by the leaders, titled \u201cPromoting Comprehensive Strategic Partnership and Building a China-Indonesia Community with a Shared Future\u201d, reflects Prabowo\u2019s strategic framing of China as an essential partner.\nFrom the various statements expressed by Prabowo, we can take a glimpse of how he stressed a multipolar world order, guided by principles like strategic autonomy, mutual trust, fairness and win-win cooperation.\nSuch a worldview indeed reflects the argument of the erosion of moral leadership by the very pole that has led the current global order, the United States, from unilateral protectionist policies, lack of appetite for all things multilateral, all the way to the moral quandary in the conflict in the Middle East.\nYet one aspect of this trip has raised concerns both domestically and internationally.

(AFP/Stringer)\nL\nast December, I arrived in Jakarta as China\u2019s ambassador to ASEAN. Living in this bustling cosmopolitan city allows me to personally witness the vigorous economic development of ASEAN countries, enjoy the practical benefits that China-ASEAN economic and trade cooperation brings to the general public and thus become more convinced that the economic development and cooperation in the region still contain great potential.\nIn the face of the once-in-a-century pandemic that lasted more than three years, China and ASEAN have not only stood together in solidarity to fight COVID-19 but have also driven their respective economies to show resilience and strength.\nASEAN countries have seen rapid trade growth, continued recovery in consumption and burgeoning digital economies, with overall economic growth expected to exceed 5 percent in 2022. China\u2019s economy has grown at an average rate of 4.8 percent over the past three years, and inflation has remained at a low 2 percent.\nChina-ASEAN bilateral trade even bucked the negative trend caused by the pandemic, jumping from US$641.5 billion in 2019 to $975.3 billion in 2022. Our two sides have been each other\u2019s largest trading partner for many years.\nWith countries overcoming the pandemic and adjusting or lifting their pandemic prevention and control measures accordingly, the prospects for China-ASEAN economic and trade cooperation have become more promising.\nAccording to international investment banks, China\u2019s domestic demand is expected to grow by 5 percent this year, driving the growth rate of some Asia-Pacific economies by about 0.4 percentage points. In particular, the accelerated recovery of China\u2019s outbound tourism and other services trade will certainly inject greater momentum for ASEAN countries to boost their economies.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nSeizing development opportunities, releasing cooperation potential, achieving rapid recovery and promoting long-term development are the common aspirations of China and ASEAN countries at present. In this context, the first-round consultations of the Version 3.0 China-ASEAN Free Trade Area (ACFTA) negotiations were officially launched in early February, kicking off a new round of economic and trade cooperation upgrades.\nWe expect ACFTA 3.0 to better benefit the people of both sides. At present, more than 90 percent of commodities (about 7,000 kinds) already enjoy zero tariff treatment between China and ASEAN, enhancing business efficiency, social employment and people\u2019s incomes.\nACFTA 3.0 will further reduce tariffs; regulate measures in fields of customs, inspection and quarantine; and enhance trade and investment liberalization and facilitation. It will also better protect the rights and interests of consumers on both sides, promote the development of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) and create more jobs.\nThe more efficient and smooth flow of economic factors within the region will eventually create a high-quality life that each of us can truly enjoy.\nWe also expect ACFTA 3.0 to give a strong impetus to regional high-quality development. ACFTA 3.0 is committed to achieving more inclusive, modern, comprehensive and win-win development, so as to better respond to the new needs and trends of China and ASEAN countries in pursuing industrial upgrading and high-quality development, especially the digital economy and green transformation.\nThis is conducive to fostering new drivers of economic growth and will also enhance deeper integration of regional industrial and supply chains, optimize the layout of production networks and enhance resilience against risks. In this process, China will actively provide technical and capacity-building support to ASEAN countries to achieve common high-quality development.\nFurther, we expect ACFTA 3.0 to inject momentum and confidence into building an open world economy\n.\nThe launch of ACFTA 3.0 negotiations demonstrates China\u2019s determination to promote high-level opening up and shows that under the current complex regional and international situation, China and ASEAN have jointly opted for openness and freedom rather than a closed-door and exclusive approach, mutually beneficial cooperation rather than a beggar-thy-neighbor approach and deeper integration rather than decoupling or disrupting supply chains.\nACFTA 3.0 will be complementary and mutually reinforcing with the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) Agreement and other intra-regional economic and trade cooperation mechanisms to promote the region as an open and inclusive epicentrum of growth.\nThe 20\nth\nNational Congress of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) pointed out that China was pursuing a mutually beneficial strategy of opening up.\nThe country strives to create new opportunities for the world with its own development and to contribute its share to building an open global economy that delivers greater benefits to all peoples.\nI look forward to witnessing the early conclusion of negotiations and implementation of ACFTA 3.0 and believe it will be an excellent example of building a closer China-ASEAN community with a shared future, providing more opportunities for China and ASEAN, for the region, and for the world.\n&nbsp;***\nThe writer is the Chinese ambassador to ASEAN.\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nRelated Articles\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources\nXi says trade war with US will have 'no winners'\nGovt\u2019s pitch to foreign housing developers no easy sell\nIndonesia's social entrepreneurship deserves Prabowo's attention\nStructured vocational internships: Bridging SMEs and skilled workforce in Indonesia\nRelated Article\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources\nXi says trade war with US will have 'no winners'\nGovt\u2019s pitch to foreign housing developers no easy sell\nIndonesia's social entrepreneurship deserves Prabowo's attention\nStructured vocational internships: Bridging SMEs and skilled workforce in Indonesia\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nMore in Opinion\nView more\nAcademia\nThe bottom-up wave of democratic rejuvenation\nAcademia\nPolice brutality: Fundamental problems in the institution\nAcademia\nFree trade deals increase Indonesian imports more than exports\nHighlight\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEditorial\nNarrow margin\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nThe Latest\nView more\nEconomy\nRI identifies 29 potential nuclear power plant sites\nEconomy\nChinese authorities are considering a weaker yuan as Trump trade risks loom, sources say\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia commences evacuation of 37 citizens in Damascus\nTech\nUS finalizes $6.1 billion Micron chip-making subsidy\nArchipelago\nTwo foreign visitors killed in tree collapse in Monkey Forest\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEconomy\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources\nRegulations\nBullion bank to launch in first half of next year, Airlangga says",

Essentially, it serves as both a decade's report card and a visionary roadmap for the future of Belt and Road collaboration. From its ambitious inception to its execution, the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) has surpassed its early projections in remarkable ways over the past decade.\nIn terms of geographic reach, the BRI has garnered participation from more than 150 countries and over 30 international organizations, accounting for almost 75 percent of the world's population. Across the spectrum of its engagement, the BRI extends its influence into a diverse array of domains, spanning economics, culture, and ecology.\nWhether we're talking about the hard connectivity of land-based roads and sea routes, the soft connectivity entailing collaborative efforts to enhance rules and standards, or the people-to-people connectivity in various arenas like education, culture, sports, tourism, and archaeology, the BRI has woven a sprawling network of cooperation and shared gains across the world.\nThe BRI marked a defining moment in China's global involvement, signifying its ascent to a prominent position on the world platform. Throughout the past decade, it has ushered in a transformative era, leaving an indelible imprint on the global terrain and underscoring its far-reaching influence across the world.\nNumerous flagship projects, such as the Mombasa-Nairobi railway, the China-Laos railway, and the Jakarta-Bandung high-speed railway, are completed and operational. These milestones are poised to give a significant boost to emerging economies.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nAccording to World Bank estimates, by the year 2030, the BRI is expected to generate a staggering US$1.6 trillion in annual global revenue, equivalent to 1.3 percent of the global GDP. As this network of transport corridors and economic hubs continues to expand, there is immense potential for enhancing trade, spurring investment, and improving the quality of life for countless citizens across participating nations.\nSince the initiation of the BRI, the aspiration of forging a community with a shared future has evolved from mere conceptualization to concrete action and from visionary idealism to tangible achievement. An increasing number of nations have come to appreciate China's assertion that development is not the exclusive privilege of a select few Western countries, but rather an inherent right accessible to all nations.\nThe BRI has orchestrated a profound transformation on the world stage for five compelling reasons. First, it has elevated the discourse on development to a pivotal global concern. Second, it has fostered an unprecedented bond between China and developing nations.\nThird, it has paved the path toward a fresh global realignment and, by extension, a novel paradigm of global politics. Fourth, it has disseminated the fundamental tenets of Chinese philosophy on a global scale.\nLastly, it has given rise to a novel breed of international institution, offering a tantalizing glimpse into a world order where the welfare of the majority takes precedence over the interests of the few\u2014a truly remarkable reimagining of global dynamics.\nAlthough the initial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic temporarily slowed its progress, the BRI has since bounced back with renewed vigor as the world slowly returns to a semblance of normalcy. This resilience serves as a testament to the BRI's remarkable adaptability in the face of ever-shifting global conditions. Indeed, the BRI stands as a sturdy and agile force, mirroring the ever-changing contours of the world it engages with.\nA curious phenomenon emerges when we examine the spectrum of countries engaged in the BRI. Developing nations consistently exhibit a favorable stance toward BRI collaboration, whereas the sentiment among developed countries is not uniformly enthusiastic. It is essential to acknowledge that developing countries often bear more significant development burdens.\nNevertheless, it is important to note that the BRI's inclusive ethos extends to all nations, with a desire for the participation of as many countries as possible, including those that are more developed.\nEver since 2013 when China launched its magnanimous BRI, Western capitals have been viewing this monumental developmental project with skepticism; their response is tainted by an unwarranted wave of negativity and misinformation. It is quite evident that certain think tanks and media in the West, particularly within the United States, harbor certain political biases when it comes to their assessments of the BRI.\nIt is common to find these studies riddled with allegations of so-called debt traps, complaints of a lack of transparency and concerns about the environmental impact. It seems as though there is a concerted effort to cast a shadow over this monumental endeavor.\nThe BRI is not merely a vehicle for China's economic growth but a pathway to shared prosperity. It aims to bridge regional divides, boost trade, and foster sustainable development across Asia, Europe, Latin America and Africa.\nFrom 2013 to 2022, China's trade with BRI participant nations has surged to a whopping $19.1 trillion, marked by an annual growth rate averaging 6.4 percent. Impressively, the cumulative two-way investment between China and its partner countries has reached $380 billion, with China contributing $240 billion, as revealed in the white paper.\nThese numbers illuminate the transformative impact of the BRI, both as a catalyst for trade and as a source of significant investment in the participating nations, underscoring its pivotal role in shaping global economic dynamics.\nThe future of BRI cooperation is rich with possibilities. As highlighted in the white paper, the BRI is a profound, long-term, and systematic global endeavor of the 21st century, and it has embarked on an enduring journey. The original framework of BRI, while primarily focusing on partnerships with developing nations, has become the bedrock upon which the Global Development Initiative, Global Security Initiative, and Global Civilization Initiative have flourished.\nThese progressive offshoots represent an intentional expansion of the initial vision, offering a wide array of dynamic approaches to fortify global development and the accomplishments of the BRI.\nAs traditional infrastructure projects persist, the rising prominence of digital connectivity is set to drive substantial demand for digital infrastructure across the region. This digital frontier is poised to assume a central role in the next phase of BRI implementation.\nConcurrently, the green and blue economies are poised to emerge as twin drivers. These multifaceted developments paint a promising picture for growth, collaboration and shared prosperity.\n&nbsp;***\nThe writer is an international affairs observer based in Karachi.\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nRelated Articles\nGovt expects Apple to up investment commitment to $1 billion\nGovt halts big infrastructure in trade-off for food security: Minister\nMeaningful digital transformation for the Asia-Pacific region\nFor Indonesia, Trumponomics will be another headwind\nLiquidity challenges and growth expectations in the new government era\nRelated Article\nGovt expects Apple to up investment commitment to $1 billion\nGovt halts big infrastructure in trade-off for food security: Minister\nMeaningful digital transformation for the Asia-Pacific region\nFor Indonesia, Trumponomics will be another headwind\nLiquidity challenges and growth expectations in the new government era\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nMore in Opinion\nView more\nAcademia\nThe bottom-up wave of democratic rejuvenation\nAcademia\nPolice brutality: Fundamental problems in the institution\nAcademia\nFree trade deals increase Indonesian imports more than exports\nHighlight\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEditorial\nNarrow margin\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nThe Latest\nView more\nEconomy\nRI identifies 29 potential nuclear power plant sites\nEconomy\nChinese authorities are considering a weaker yuan as Trump trade risks loom, sources say\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia commences evacuation of 37 citizens in Damascus\nTech\nUS finalizes $6.1 billion Micron chip-making subsidy\nArchipelago\nTwo foreign visitors killed in tree collapse in Monkey Forest\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEconomy\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources\nRegulations\nBullion bank to launch in first half of next year, Airlangga says",

(asean.org/-)\nT\nhe new year dawns amid changes unseen in a century, including the COVID-19 pandemic in particular. It will be a milestone year for China and ASEAN, as they usher in the 30\nth\nanniversary of China-ASEAN dialogue relations.\nA review of the 30 years shows an extraordinary journey defined by tremendous progress. In 1991, China and ASEAN initiated the dialogue process marked by the attendance of then-foreign minister Qian Qichen at the opening ceremony of the 24\nth\nASEAN Foreign Ministers\u2019 Meeting. In 2003, China acceded to the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation in Southeast Asia, ASEAN\u2019s first dialogue partner to do so, and established the China-ASEAN strategic partnership, which was again a trailblazing endeavor.\nBy 2010, the China-ASEAN Free Trade Area was up and running. In 2013, President Xi Jinping proposed to jointly build a closer China-ASEAN community with a shared future during his visit to ASEAN countries. In 2018, the China-ASEAN Strategic Partnership Vision 2030 was issued, a blueprint eyeing the future. Last year, after COVID-19 hit us all, China and ASEAN stood in firm solidarity to fight the virus, resume growth and protect people\u2019s livelihoods.\nAmong ASEAN\u2019s dialogue partners, China has been number one on many fronts, which enables our relations to be proudly defined as comprehensive, pioneering and creative. Just as President Xi said in the 17\nth\nChina-ASEAN Expo &amp; China-ASEAN Business and Investment Summit late last year, \u201cThe China-ASEAN relationship has grown into the most successful and vibrant model for cooperation in the Asia-Pacific and an exemplary effort in building a community with a shared future for mankind.\u201d\nYet besides the ever-growing momentum, there are things that remain unchanged between China and ASEAN in 30 years. First, the shared commitment to peaceful development and good neighborliness.\nBoth China and ASEAN believe that prosperity is nowhere to be found without peace and stability. As permanent neighbors and close partners, China and ASEAN countries hold dear the tradition of mutual respect and mutual assistance and the wisdom of seeking common ground while shelving differences and resolving disagreements through dialogue and consultation.\nSecond, the shared commitment to common development and win-win cooperation. While China has remained ASEAN\u2019s largest trading partner for 11 consecutive years, ASEAN surpassed the European Union last year as China\u2019 s largest trading partner for the first time in history.\nThird is the shared commitment to multilateralism, openness and inclusiveness. ASEAN is tremendously inclusive as a regional organization that successfully accommodates political systems, religions and cultures that could not be more different. Multilateralism is in the genes of ASEAN. China has been firmly committed to supporting ASEAN centrality in regional cooperation and ASEAN\u2019s greater role in building an open and inclusive regional architecture.\nNo matter what happens to the international and regional landscape, it has been a solid consensus between China and ASEAN to choose solidarity over division, openness over isolation and cooperation over confrontation.\nThe year 2021 means a lot for both China and ASEAN. It is the centenary year for the Communist Party of China, the first year of China\u2019s 14\nth\nFive-Year Plan, and the start of China\u2019s new journey to fully build a modern socialist country. For ASEAN\u2019s part, it is halfway through the ASEAN Community Vision 2025, with significant achievements in the community-building of three pillars. ASEAN is preparing itself in every way for bigger progress. The special juncture coincides with the 30\nth\nanniversary of China-ASEAN relations, a new starting point brimming with new opportunities.\nHere are some highlights of the year that can be expected.\nFirst, China-ASEAN high-level exchanges will continue to guide our way forward. China looks forward to carrying out a number of events with ASEAN to celebrate the 30\nth\nanniversary. Our leaders will, as always, be engaged in close interactions and guide strategically.\nThe most recent engagement is taking place this week, with State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi visiting four ASEAN member states: Myanmar, Indonesia, Brunei and the Philippines. The China-ASEAN relationship is among the top priorities of his agenda. China is committed to doing its utmost to safeguarding the peace and stability of the South China Sea by deepening mutual trust, promoting cooperation and managing differences with relevant ASEAN countries.\nSecond, public health cooperation will be deepened to end the pandemic at an early date. China is actively exploring research and development and production cooperation on vaccines with ASEAN. As a total of 3 million doses of vaccines developed by Sinovac Biotech arrived in Indonesia recently, China will continue to take real action to make COVID-19 vaccines more affordable and accessible for the people of the region.\nChina will work with ASEAN to enhance its joint pandemic response, including setting up reserves of medical supplies and a liaison mechanism for public health emergencies and helping strengthen ASEAN\u2019s public health performance, such as in personnel training, resource allocation and capacity building.\nThird, China and ASEAN need to keep the strong momentum of economic cooperation and accelerate regional economic recovery. We will work for the early entry into force of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), seek greater synergy in our policies for economic recovery, expand the scope of \u201cfast tracks\u201d for travel and \u201cgreen lanes\u201d for cargo transportation in a well thought out way and implement the China-ASEAN Free Trade Agreement and its upgraded protocol.\nWe will also promote high-quality Belt and Road cooperation by ensuring steady progress in key projects, including the China-Laos Railway, the China-Thailand Railway and the Jakarta-Bandung Railway, to enhance local infrastructure connectivity. We will seize the opportunities of the digital economy and cultivate new cooperation areas in e-commerce, big data, 5G and smart cities.\nFourth, creative efforts will be made to boost people-to-people exchanges and sustainable development. Flagship projects such as the China-ASEAN Young Leaders Scholarship and China-ASEAN Short Video Contest will expand new fronts of connections between the people. As 2021 is also the China-ASEAN Year of Sustainable Development, China wishes to increase cooperation with ASEAN in poverty reduction, environmental protection, disaster relief, climate change, among others, and explore the establishment of the blue economic partnership.\nSunshine will eventually dispel the shadows, and spring isn\u2019t far behind. As we usher in the historic year of the 30\nth\nanniversary of China-ASEAN relations, we are ready to ride on the rising tide and build a closer China-ASEAN community with a shared future!\n&nbsp;***\nThe writer is Chinese ambassador to ASEAN.\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nRelated Articles\nAssad's fall in Syria exposes limits of China's Middle East diplomacy\nXi says trade war with US will have 'no winners'\nIs Southeast Asia the next frontier for AI?\nVietnam to build $67 billion high-speed railway\nMultilateral system in crisis\nRelated Article\nAssad's fall in Syria exposes limits of China's Middle East diplomacy\nXi says trade war with US will have 'no winners'\nIs Southeast Asia the next frontier for AI?\nVietnam to build $67 billion high-speed railway\nMultilateral system in crisis\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nMore in Academia\nView more\nAcademia\nThe bottom-up wave of democratic rejuvenation\nAcademia\nPolice brutality: Fundamental problems in the institution\nAcademia\nFree trade deals increase Indonesian imports more than exports\nHighlight\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEditorial\nNarrow margin\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nThe Latest\nView more\nEconomy\nRI identifies 29 potential nuclear power plant sites\nEconomy\nChinese authorities are considering a weaker yuan as Trump trade risks loom, sources say\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia commences evacuation of 37 citizens in Damascus\nTech\nUS finalizes $6.1 billion Micron chip-making subsidy\nArchipelago\nTwo foreign visitors killed in tree collapse in Monkey Forest\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEconomy\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources\nRegulations\nBullion bank to launch in first half of next year, Airlangga says",

Some 8 million bulk vaccines in four envirotainers were directly transported to state-owned pharmaceutical company PT Biofarma\u2019s facilities in Bandung, West Java. (Courtesy of the COVID-19 Response and Economic Recovery Committee/. )\nC\nOVID-19 is still ravaging the world, with its variants creating new waves of infection around the globe. At this critical juncture, we should have united as one to fight the virus. However, attention has been distracted from time to time, as certain countries take advantage of COVID-19 origin-tracing to smear others and serve their political agenda.\nAt the onset of COVID-19, China reported the latest developments to the World Health Organization at the earliest possible time. Since then China has shared its response experience with the international community in a timely manner, assisted over 150 countries and international organizations with medical supplies to the best of its capability, and led the largest-scale global vaccine cooperation, thus making outstanding contributions to global public health security.\nChina has all along taken a scientific approach to the global cooperation in science-based origin-tracing. WHO experts were invited twice to China for research. They went to all the places they wanted to go and met all the people they wanted to meet. Then the report by the WHO-China joint study team was released in March this year, presenting the most authoritative, professional and science-based conclusions on origin-tracing.\nAccording to the report, experts concluded that \u201ca laboratory leak is extremely unlikely\u201d and put forward important recommendations, including \u201csearching for possible early cases on a global scale\u201d and \u201cstudying the possibility of cold-chain transmission of virus\u201d. The report also sets out detailed recommendations for what next steps should be taken to trace the virus. Chinese experts also took the initiative to submit China\u2019s proposal on the second phase of origin-tracing to the WHO\nInternational experts have fully affirmed China\u2019s openness and transparency during the research process, the outcome of which is the scientific and authoritative report that forms the basis for the next stage of tracing.\nYet in the meantime, certain countries are obsessed with politically motivated origin-tracing. They have turned a blind eye to those science-based and authoritative conclusions and spread false information and lies to distort the positions of other countries.\nChina\u2019s position on global origin-tracing is consistent and clear-cut. First, origin-tracing is a matter of science. It should be and can only be left to scientists to identify, through scientific research, the possible zoonotic source and animal-human transmission routes. No country has the right to put its own political interests above people\u2019s lives, nor should a matter of science be politicized for the purpose of slandering and attacking others.\nSecond, the findings and recommendations of the WHO-China joint study report are widely recognized by the international community, especially scientists, and must be respected and implemented by all parties including the WHO. Going forward, global origin-tracing should and must proceed from that basis, instead of reinventing the wheel.\nThird, China has all along supported and will continue to take part in science-based origin-tracing efforts. What China opposes is politicizing origin-tracing, or origin-tracing that goes against the WHA resolutions and disregards the joint study report.\nFourth, the WHO Secretariat should act on the WHA resolutions, conduct thorough consultation with member states on the global origin-tracing work plan, including the follow-up mechanism, and fully respect the views of member states. Very importantly, the plan for origin-tracing involving a particular country must be decided through consultation with the country concerned, as it provides the basis for effective cooperation.\nOrigin-tracing cooperation must be based on science, and politicization must be firmly rejected. Nearly 80 countries, including multiple ASEAN member states, have recently expressed support for the WHO-China joint study report and opposed politicization of origin-tracing by sending letters to the WHO director-general and issuing statements and diplomatic notes.\nOrganizations in the civil society, think tanks and over 300 political parties from more than 100 countries and regions submitted a joint statement to the WHO Secretariat, calling on the WHO to conduct the study on COVID-19 origin-tracing objectively and fairly, and firmly opposing politicization. The legitimate appeal and voice of justice from the international community shall be heard.\nA virus knows no borders and does not distinguish between races. China, like other countries, is a victim of the pandemic and hopes to find out the origin and cut off its transmission as early as possible. Given the ongoing spread and rebound of the virus, the priority remains to be stepping up equitable distribution of COVID-19 vaccines and enhancing solidarity and cooperation.\nChina firmly supports efforts to make COVID-19 vaccines global public goods, opposes \u201cvaccine nationalism\u201d and rejects attempts to create a \u201cvaccine divide\u201d. To help ASEAN put the pandemic under control as quickly as possible, China has been overcoming difficulties to increase vaccine cooperation and aid with ASEAN. To date, China has provided all ASEAN member states with a total of 190 million COVID-19 vaccines and worked on vaccine trials with Indonesia and several other ASEAN countries. China shares with ASEAN technologies and experience and supports ASEAN countries in building regional vaccine production and distribution centers.\nAt the multilateral level, China has pledged to contribute 10 million doses of vaccines to the WHO-led COVAX program. As President Xi Jinping pledged a few days ago in his written message to the International Forum on COVID-19 Vaccine Cooperation, China will strive to provide 2 billion COVID-19 vaccine doses to the world throughout this year and offer US$100 million to COVAX that will be distributed to developing countries, including ASEAN countries.\nIn China\u2019s vaccine cooperation with ASEAN, no geopolitical agenda is pursued, no economic gains are vied for, and no political conditions are attached. It is all about making the vaccines global public goods that are accessible and affordable to the people in ASEAN, so that ASEAN prevails over the pandemic once and for all and as early as possible. Going forward, China-ASEAN anti-pandemic cooperation will inject new impetus into China-ASEAN relations and bring about an even closer China-ASEAN community with a shared future.\nThe pandemic has unveiled shortcomings and loopholes in the global governance system of public health, sounding alarm for the international community. It won\u2019t be the last public health emergency in our global village. Therefore, it is of paramount importance for the international community to be guided by the vision of building a global community with a shared future, reject political manipulation and jointly tackle challenges for the benefit of all.\n&nbsp;***\nThe writer is Chinese ambassador to ASEAN.\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nRelated Articles\nPutin\u2019s India visit aims to shape global multipolarity\nTaiwan's Lai kicks off Marshall Islands visit as China fumes\nCollaboration is strengthening cybersecurity defenses in Indonesia\nInnovative, life-changing tools key to ending TB epidemic\nWong\u2019s ASEAN consolidation\nRelated Article\nPutin\u2019s India visit aims to shape global multipolarity\nTaiwan's Lai kicks off Marshall Islands visit as China fumes\nCollaboration is strengthening cybersecurity defenses in Indonesia\nInnovative, life-changing tools key to ending TB epidemic\nWong\u2019s ASEAN consolidation\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nMore in Academia\nView more\nAcademia\nThe bottom-up wave of democratic rejuvenation\nAcademia\nPolice brutality: Fundamental problems in the institution\nAcademia\nFree trade deals increase Indonesian imports more than exports\nHighlight\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEditorial\nNarrow margin\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nThe Latest\nView more\nEconomy\nRI identifies 29 potential nuclear power plant sites\nEconomy\nChinese authorities are considering a weaker yuan as Trump trade risks loom, sources say\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia commences evacuation of 37 citizens in Damascus\nTech\nUS finalizes $6.1 billion Micron chip-making subsidy\nArchipelago\nTwo foreign visitors killed in tree collapse in Monkey Forest\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEconomy\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources\nRegulations\nBullion bank to launch in first half of next year, Airlangga says",

Built to support the operations of nickel producer PT Vale Indonesia, the power plant generates 110 megawatts, of which 10 MW are distributed to the surrounding community.  (Antara/Jojon)\nA\nSEAN countries are now shifting from traditional energy sources like coal to renewables, a change that will impact the region\u2019s nearly 700 million lives. With most member states aiming for net-zero emissions by 2050, this transition is not only necessary but also an opportunity to create a fairer, greener economy.\nThis shift toward sustainable energy underscores the importance of a just transition that carefully addresses the socioeconomic impacts on communities and workers from traditional sectors. Internationally recognized frameworks and regional directives emphasize the need for robust social dialogue, active stakeholder involvement and the creation of equitable, green job opportunities.\nComprehensive strategies for reskilling and upskilling workers, ensuring social protection and fostering inclusive economic growth are vital. A study by Obviously Sustainable (OS), supported by the Konrad-Adenauer-Stiftung Regional Programme on Energy Security and Climate Change Asia-Pacific (RECAP), examines how Indonesia and Malaysia are navigating these changes.\nThe journey begins with strong social dialogue and active stakeholder participation.\nIndonesia's state electricity company PLN and Malaysia's Petronas have taken significant steps to include workers and community insights in their strategic plans.

In my decades-long interactions with friends and colleagues from the ASEAN family, I could always find heart-warming friendliness but also uncertainty about China from time to time, which is, unfortunately, exacerbated recently by the misleading smearing of China by a few Western politicians.\nA question of common interest thus emerges: Where is China\u2019s foreign policy heading and what is it aiming for?\nThe Xi Jinping Thought on Diplomacy doctrine would be the most authoritative answer to this question. Since the 18\nth\nNational Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC), the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core has put forward a series of new ideas, new propositions and new initiatives, pointing the direction and providing fundamental guidance for China\u2019s foreign policy.\nChina is committed to building a community with a shared future for mankind, which is the essence of Xi Jinping Thought on Diplomacy.\nPresident Xi points out, \u201cHumankind, by living in the same global village within the same time and space where history and reality meet, has increasingly emerged as an intimate community of shared future. No country could meet the challenges for mankind alone.\u201d\nThe foresight of this vision is once again proved to be true in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.\nTo build a community with a shared future for mankind is the goal of China\u2019s foreign policy. Toward this end, China has been working hard all along, and the most recent effort would be our engagement in international cooperation against COVID-19. As far as ASEAN is concerned, China provided COVID-19-related information in a timely manner, shared experience in control and treatment, and offered a large number of medical supplies.\nThe revival of the regional economy as soon as possible presents another daunting challenge of the day. China has opened or is planning to open \u201cfast-track lanes\u201d for essential personnel exchanges and \u201cgreen channels\u201d for cargo transportation with Singapore, Myanmar, Indonesia and Malaysia. China and ASEAN countries are also jointly working on COVID-19 vaccine research and development, as well as production. It\u2019s good to know that phase III clinical trials of a vaccine developed in China was rolled out in Indonesia days ago.\nChina is committed to the path of peaceful development. There are people in the West who apply the \u201cThucydides Trap\u201d or \u201cKindleberger Trap\u201d to interpret China\u2019s rapid development. Trapped in the belief that \u201ca strong country must seek hegemony\u201d, they demonize China as a potential danger to the world.\nOn the contrary, the Chinese culture holds dear harmony and unity; harmony being the most valuable and harmony without uniformity. Invasion and hegemony-seeking have never been in the Chinese DNA. Facts still speak louder than words. For instance, China\u2019s military expenditure was an average of 1.3 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in the last 10 years, lower than the world average.\nChina has always been dedicated to resolving disputes through negotiations in peace while safeguarding China\u2019s territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests. Guided by the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the spirit of fostering amity and friendship with neighbors, China has properly solved most of the leftover boundary issues step by step with neighboring countries in the past seven decades, and the delineated boundary is about 90 percent of China\u2019s total boundary on land.\nRegarding disputes over the South China Sea, China remains committed to the \u201cdual-track\u201d approach of resolving disputes peacefully through consultation and negotiation between countries directly concerned and of upholding peace and stability in the South China Sea by China and ASEAN countries through joint efforts, including regional rules-making.\nIn 2013, President Xi put forward the major initiatives of the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21\nst\nCentury Maritime Silk Road, which later turned into the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). It focuses on economic cooperation, rather than geopolitical alliance. It is open and inclusive and rests upon extensive consultation, joint contribution and shared benefits.\nSix years on, the initiative is materializing and has become one of the most popular global public goods.&nbsp;It is exciting to see flourishing BRI cooperation between China and ASEAN countries in infrastructure, energy, manufacturing, industrial parks and more. Such cooperation has already delivered real dividends to local development and people.\nPopulism, protectionism, unilateralism and antiglobalization sentiments are proliferating now. Certain countries attribute their&nbsp;domestic problems to external shocks, claiming that they have been \u201ctaken advantage of\u201d in the existing trading system.&nbsp;They adopt&nbsp;various measures, including trade,&nbsp;to&nbsp;suppress the development of others, even willfully withdrawing from international treaties and organizations and scapegoating others. Their behavior has seriously violated the multilateral trading system.\nYet despite this, as a firm defender of economic globalization&nbsp;and&nbsp;multilateral trading system, China continues to promote trade and investment liberalization and facilitation, a fair, equitable&nbsp;and transparent system of international economic and trading rules, as well as a more open, connected and integrated global economy.\nThe existing international system was established after World War II under the leadership of United States-led Western countries. Despite its deficiencies and drawbacks, it has played an important role in maintaining world peace and development over the past 70 years. The purpose of reforming the current international system is not to overturn it and start anew, but to adjust and improve it within the overall framework and to make it better adapted&nbsp;to the evolved international landscape.\nChina firmly safeguards&nbsp;the core role of the United Nations in global governance and promotes the building of a more just and equitable&nbsp;international governance system. China honors its commitments on global issues such as climate change&nbsp;by staying on course of green, low-carbon and sustainable development.\nChina will do well only when the world does well and vice versa. On our way toward a community with a shared future, China will work together with ASEAN&nbsp;countries and all&nbsp;other countries in the world to eradicate poverty and seek prosperity and development, to end conflicts and uphold peace,&nbsp;and to bridge the gap between civilizations through exchanges and mutual learning. Together we march toward a better world for all!\n&nbsp;***\nThe writer is ambassador of the People\u2019s Republic of China to ASEAN\n.\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nRelated Articles\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources\nAssad's fall in Syria exposes limits of China's Middle East diplomacy\nWhat Beijing\u2019s new claims over a disputed coral reef mean\nPrabowo's deliverables\nNaval ship acquisition in the face of modern warfare\nRelated Article\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources\nAssad's fall in Syria exposes limits of China's Middle East diplomacy\nWhat Beijing\u2019s new claims over a disputed coral reef mean\nPrabowo's deliverables\nNaval ship acquisition in the face of modern warfare\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nMore in Paper\nView more\nOpinion\nAnalysis: Govt adopts mandatory B35 biodiesel program as CPO prices tumble\nBusiness\nGlobal chip crunch stunts Indonesia car sales recovery\nBusiness\nXL profit falls in Q3 as tower sale income dries\nHighlight\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEditorial\nNarrow margin\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nThe Latest\nView more\nEconomy\nRI identifies 29 potential nuclear power plant sites\nEconomy\nChinese authorities are considering a weaker yuan as Trump trade risks loom, sources say\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia commences evacuation of 37 citizens in Damascus\nTech\nUS finalizes $6.1 billion Micron chip-making subsidy\nArchipelago\nTwo foreign visitors killed in tree collapse in Monkey Forest\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEconomy\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources\nRegulations\nBullion bank to launch in first half of next year, Airlangga says",

(China Daily/File)\nR\necently, the still-raging Omicron variant has led to a sharp surge of infections in East Asia, further distancing us from a future free of COVID-19. Slowed economic growth has made it harder to keep up people\u2019s living standards.\nThe big picture gets gloomier. Traditional security issues are complicated by new ones, giving rise to more uncertainties. Perhaps it has to be admitted that East Asian cooperation has again come to a crossroads in the complex regional and international landscape.\nYet solutions offered by various countries differ. For China, it firmly believes that multilateralism remains the \u201cmaster key\u201d to challenges faced by East Asia as well as the anchor for regional peace and prosperity.\nPeace and security, a must for development and prosperity, remain the shared aspirations of people in the region. Then what shall and could be done?\nWe regional countries need to serve as the builders and guardians of peace in the region. We need to pursue dialogue instead of confrontation, build partnerships instead of alliances and make concerted efforts to address the various negative factors that might threaten or undermine peace.\nMoreover, we need to champion sincere dialogue, practical cooperation, openness and inclusiveness. We need to fend off security risks and actively explore a regional security architecture.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nHaving stood against power politics and hegemony all along, China is as steadfast as always in safeguarding the enduring peace of the region together with our neighbors. China will never seek hegemony or a sphere of influence, less still will it bully other countries.\nAs victory over COVID-19 and economic recovery remain the common priority for the region\u2019s countries, there is much more we can do together.\nFor instance, it is of paramount importance to stand in solidarity, share information and strengthen joint prevention and control. The strategic significance of vaccines cannot be overemphasized. Cooperation in vaccine research and development, production and distribution requires our concerted endeavors, to make vaccines truly accessible and affordable for everyone.\nOpenness is the sure way for sustained East Asia cooperation. Open regionalism and free trade are conducive to the next phase of regional economic integration. True multilateralism means inclusiveness rather than exclusion, integration rather than decoupling. The sheer obsession with high standards and pursuit of dominance in regional economic agendas, in disregard of openness and inclusiveness, will lead the region nowhere. Free trade prevails when it fits the situation on the ground in East Asia.\nDiversity and inclusiveness are embedded in East Asia\u2019s DNA. Be it the political systems, religions, cultures or models of development, East Asia is&nbsp;well known for its immense diversity, even since ancient times. It has been openness that guides the regional economic integration. It has been coordination and consultation on an equal footing that drives the ASEAN-led regional cooperation. And it has been inclusiveness that underpins an open and non-exclusive East Asia family.\nThose who are preoccupied with an ideology-driven and value-oriented mindset risk severely undermining the foundations of cooperation in East Asia and perhaps would find themselves the least wanted by the region\u2019s countries. Unfortunately, the self-claimed \u201cbeacon\u201d would eventually find itself unnecessary and unhelpful in this part of the world, as each and every nation here has its own way of shining.\nWhen it comes to East Asian cooperation, China and ASEAN have been the backbone. China unswervingly supports ASEAN centrality in the regional architecture and unswervingly supports ASEAN in playing a leading role in regional affairs. China is proud to have made significant contributions to East Asian cooperation. The development of China, a major opportunity for the region, is in no way a \u201cchallenge\u201d as painted by some other countries.\nEast Asian cooperation has been inexhaustibly powered by the steady and sound growth of China-ASEAN relations. China will, as always, unswervingly see ASEAN as a high priority in its neighborhood diplomacy and unswervingly support ASEAN unity and community building. Last year, President Xi Jinping and leaders of ASEAN member states jointly announced the establishment of a comprehensive strategic partnership between China and ASEAN, identifying fields and measures of cooperation and thus charting the course forward. The new milestone will inject strong impetus into China-ASEAN ties.\nThe tremendous progress of cooperation between China and ASEAN speaks for itself. For instance, our US$878.2 billion of two-way trade in 2021, with a growth rate of 28.1 percent, enables us to remain each other\u2019s largest trading partner. The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) that came into effect on the very first day of 2022 ushers regional free trade into a new era. Major infrastructure projects under the Belt and Road Initiative are delivering real dividends to local people. The China-Laos railway that started operation at the end of last year is serving as a fresh channel of transport between China and ASEAN.\nYet against the prevailing trend of cooperation regionwide, an updated Indo-Pacific Strategy has caught our attention in recent days. Dominated by the Cold War mentality, the strategy uses an easy excuse of the \u201cChina threat\u201d and is in pursuit of geopolitical rivalry. Be it the five objectives or the action plan, people do not need to make an effort to discover its hidden agenda of containing China and defending hegemony.\nOn paper, the \u201cstrategy\u201d is about a free and open region. In reality, it is busy with building regional blocs such as AUKUS and the Quad.\nOn the one hand, it talks about bolstered regional security. On the other, it is about reinforcing deterrence by helping an ally with nuclear submarines and risking the region with potential nuclear proliferation.\nOn the one hand, it looks to regional prosperity. Yet on the other, it undermines the ASEAN-centered regional cooperation architecture by driving a wedge among countries with its attempt to instigate confrontation, thus seriously threatening the fruits and prospects of regional cooperation.\nAt the crossroad, it is worth pondering, more than ever, the course and direction ahead. One thing is for sure. China will continue to keep up with the trend of the times, remain focused on improving people\u2019s livelihoods and safeguarding regional peace and development, guided by the spirit of building a global community with a shared future, China will remain as steadfast as ever in championing multilateralism and working together with ASEAN toward an even brighter future of East Asian cooperation.\n&nbsp;***\nThe writer is Chinese ambassador to ASEAN.\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nRelated Articles\nMultilateral system in crisis\nRubio pick signals a Trump China policy that could go beyond tariffs\nA new journey in China-Indonesia relationship: Building a shared future\nPrabowo\u2019s \u2018good neighbor\u2019 policy takes Indonesia beyond Southeast Asia\nReclaiming RCEP to elevate ASEAN centrality in trade\nRelated Article\nMultilateral system in crisis\nRubio pick signals a Trump China policy that could go beyond tariffs\nA new journey in China-Indonesia relationship: Building a shared future\nPrabowo\u2019s \u2018good neighbor\u2019 policy takes Indonesia beyond Southeast Asia\nReclaiming RCEP to elevate ASEAN centrality in trade\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nMore in Opinion\nView more\nAcademia\nThe bottom-up wave of democratic rejuvenation\nAcademia\nPolice brutality: Fundamental problems in the institution\nAcademia\nFree trade deals increase Indonesian imports more than exports\nHighlight\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEditorial\nNarrow margin\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nThe Latest\nView more\nEconomy\nRI identifies 29 potential nuclear power plant sites\nEconomy\nChinese authorities are considering a weaker yuan as Trump trade risks loom, sources say\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia commences evacuation of 37 citizens in Damascus\nTech\nUS finalizes $6.1 billion Micron chip-making subsidy\nArchipelago\nTwo foreign visitors killed in tree collapse in Monkey Forest\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEconomy\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources\nRegulations\nBullion bank to launch in first half of next year, Airlangga says",

REUTERS/Adnan Abidi (Reuters/ADNAN ABIDI)\nVersi Bahasa Indonesia\n\u201c\nVasudhaiva Kutumbakam\u201d\n\u2013 these two words capture a deep philosophy. It means \u201cthe world is one family\u201d. This is an all-embracing outlook that encourages us to progress as one universal family, transcending borders, languages, and ideologies.\nDuring India\u2019s Group of 20 presidency, this has translated into a call for human-centric progress. As one Earth, we are coming together to nurture our planet. As one family, we support each other in the pursuit of growth. And we move together towards a shared future \u2013 one future \u2013 which is an undeniable truth in these interconnected times.\nThe post-pandemic world order is very different from the world before it. There are three important changes, among others.\nFirst, there is a growing realization that a shift away from a gross domestic product (GDP)-centric view of the world to a human-centric view is needed.&nbsp;\nSecond, the world is recognizing the importance of resilience and reliability in global supply chains.\nThird, there is a collective call for boosting multilateralism through the reform of global institutions.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nOur G20 presidency has played the role of a catalyst in these shifts.&nbsp;\nIn December 2022, when we took over the presidency from Indonesia, I had written that a mindset shift must be catalyzed by the G20. This was especially needed in the context of mainstreaming the marginalized aspirations of developing countries, the Global South and Africa.\nThe Voice of Global South Summit, which witnessed participation from 125 countries, was one of the foremost initiatives under our presidency. It was an important exercise to gather inputs and ideas from the Global South. Further, our presidency has not only seen the largest-ever participation from African countries but has also pushed for the inclusion of the African Union as a permanent member of the G20.\nAn interconnected world means our challenges across domains are interlinked. This is the midway year of the 2030 Agenda and many are noting with great concern that the progress on Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is off-track. The G20 2023 Action Plan on Accelerating Progress on SDGs will spearhead the future direction of the G20 toward implementing SDGs.\nIn India, living in harmony with nature has been a norm since ancient times and we have been contributing our share towards climate action even in modern times.&nbsp;\nMany countries of the Global South are at various stages of development and climate action must be a complementary pursuit. Ambitions for climate action must be matched with actions on climate finance and the transfer of technology.&nbsp;\nWe believe there is a need to move away from a purely restrictive attitude of what should not be done, to a more constructive attitude focusing on what can be done to fight climate change.\nThe Chennai HLPs for a Sustainable and Resilient Blue Economy focus on keeping our oceans healthy.&nbsp;\nA global ecosystem for clean and green hydrogen will emerge from our presidency, along with a Green Hydrogen Innovation Centre.\nIn 2015, we launched the International Solar Alliance. Now, through the Global Biofuels Alliance, we will support the world to enable energy transitions in tune with the benefits of a circular economy.\nDemocratizing climate action is the best way to impart momentum to the movement. Just as individuals make daily decisions based on their long-term health, they can make lifestyle decisions based on the impact on the planet\u2019s long-term health. Just like yoga became a global mass movement for wellness, we have also nudged the world with Lifestyles for Sustainable Environment (LiFE).\nDue to the impact of climate change, ensuring food and nutritional security will be crucial. Millets, or\nShree Anna\n, can help with this while also boosting climate-smart agriculture. In the International Year of Millets, we have taken millets to global palates. The Deccan High Level Principles on Food Security and Nutrition is also helpful in this direction.\nTechnology is transformative but it also needs to be made inclusive. In the past, the benefits of technological advancements have not benefited all sections of society equally. India, over the last few years, has shown how technology can be leveraged to narrow inequalities, rather than widen them.&nbsp;\nFor instance, the billions across the world that remain unbanked, or lack digital identities, can be financially included through digital public infrastructure (DPI). The solutions we have built using our DPI have now been recognized globally. Now, through the G20, we will help developing countries adapt, build, and scale DPI to unlock the power of inclusive growth.\nThat India is the fastest-growing large economy is no accident. Our simple, scalable and sustainable solutions have empowered the vulnerable and the marginalized to lead our development story. From space to sports, economy to entrepreneurship, Indian women have taken the lead in various sectors. They have shifted the narrative from the development of women to women-led development. Our G20 presidency is working on bridging the gender digital divide, reducing labor force participation gaps and enabling a larger role for women in leadership and decision-making.\nFor India, the G20 presidency is not merely a high-level diplomatic endeavor. As the mother of democracy and a model of diversity, we opened the doors of this experience to the world.\nToday, accomplishing things at scale is a quality that is associated with India. The G20 presidency is no exception. It has become a people-driven movement. Over 200 meetings will have been organized in 60 Indian cities across the length and breadth of our nation, hosting nearly 100,000 delegates from 125 countries by the end of our term. No presidency has ever encompassed such a vast and diverse geographical expanse.\nIt is one thing to hear about India\u2019s demography, democracy, diversity and development from someone else. It is totally different to experience them first-hand. I am sure our G20 delegates would vouch for this.\nOur G20 presidency strives to bridge divides, dismantle barriers, and sow seeds of collaboration that nourish a world where unity prevails over discord, where shared destiny eclipses isolation. As the G20 president, we had pledged to make the global table larger, ensuring that every voice is heard and every country contributes.\nI am positive that we have matched our pledge with actions and outcomes.\n&nbsp;***\nThe writer is Prime Minister of India.\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nRelated Articles\nThe fall and rise of American democracy\nIs the G77 the future of multilateralism?\nHealing our planet is now restoration, not just conservation\nRevolutionizing digitalization: The key to transforming Indonesia into a developed nation\nAfrican leaders in Beijing eyeing big loans and investment\nRelated Article\nThe fall and rise of American democracy\nIs the G77 the future of multilateralism?\nHealing our planet is now restoration, not just conservation\nRevolutionizing digitalization: The key to transforming Indonesia into a developed nation\nAfrican leaders in Beijing eyeing big loans and investment\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nMore in Opinion\nView more\nAcademia\nThe bottom-up wave of democratic rejuvenation\nAcademia\nPolice brutality: Fundamental problems in the institution\nAcademia\nFree trade deals increase Indonesian imports more than exports\nHighlight\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEditorial\nNarrow margin\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nThe Latest\nView more\nEconomy\nRI identifies 29 potential nuclear power plant sites\nEconomy\nChinese authorities are considering a weaker yuan as Trump trade risks loom, sources say\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia commences evacuation of 37 citizens in Damascus\nTech\nUS finalizes $6.1 billion Micron chip-making subsidy\nArchipelago\nTwo foreign visitors killed in tree collapse in Monkey Forest\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEconomy\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources\nRegulations\nBullion bank to launch in first half of next year, Airlangga says",

Many ASEAN products, such as coffee and shrimp chips from Indonesia and durian from Thailand, are hot sellers on China's e-commerce platforms.\nThis year, the \u201cBrand and Quality Online Shopping Festival\u201d held by China has created the \u201cASEAN offerings\u201d activity, which promotes ASEAN\u2019s specialty products on the Chinese market through special online events and live streaming.\nThe digital economy has changed the way people live and represents the future of the global economy. For developing countries, the digital economy is an opportunity to enliven the consumer market, create new growth points, empower industrial transformation and upgrading, give rise to new business models and promote high-quality development.\nChina and ASEAN are both highlands of digital economy development.

By the end of June 2022, half of the world's 10 fastest-growing countries in terms of online retail sales, including the top three, were ASEAN members. ASEAN is expected to be among the world's top five digital economies by 2025.\nChina and ASEAN are natural partners in digital economy development. The ASEAN market has already attracted some leading Chinese digital enterprises, including e-commerce platforms such as Alibaba, Tencent and Jingdong, mobile payment enterprises such as Ant Group, digital information enterprises such as Huawei and ZTE and some courier and logistics enterprises.\nThese Chinese enterprises have cooperated with partners in ASEAN countries to promote advanced technologies and mature business models within ASEAN, and they have assisted Southeast Asia in building digital economic ecosystems that promote the rapid rise of local digital enterprises such as Shopee, Lazada and Tokopedia, which has greatly driven the development of ASEAN's digital industry and the construction of its digital interconnectivity.\nBecause of geographic proximity, people-to-people affinity, integrated economies and highly complementary industries, China and ASEAN members are highly compatible in terms of digital economy development planning and industrial needs. The digital economy will be a new \u201cblue ocean\u201d in China-ASEAN economic and trade cooperation, creating many opportunities.\nAt the ASEAN-China Special Summit to Commemorate the 30\nth\nanniversary of ASEAN-China Dialogue Relations in 2021, China and ASEAN established a comprehensive strategic partnership, and Chinese President Xi Jinping emphasized that China would expand cooperation in the digital economy with ASEAN.\nSince then, the two sides have been accelerating digital cooperation, gradually improving strategic alignment and speeding up the implementation of the Initiative on Building ASEAN-China Partnership on Digital Economy. More than half of ASEAN member states have signed bilateral e-commerce cooperation memorandums with China and established the \"Silk Road E-commerce\" cooperation mechanism.\nNew chapters on the digital economy that are included in the ongoing negotiations on the Version 3.0 China-ASEAN Free Trade Area, and an initiative on deepening e-commerce cooperation will be published at the upcoming China-ASEAN Leaders\u2019 Summit.\nIn addition, China and the Southeast Asian bloc have utilized platforms such as the China-ASEAN Expo and the China-ASEAN Information Port to vigorously promote cooperation on projects in the fields of digital government, digital enterprises, digital industries and new communications.\nThis year marks the 10\nth\nanniversary of President Xi\u2019s proposal to build a closer China-ASEAN community with a shared future through the Belt and Road Initiative. China will use this as an opportunity to plan for cooperation in areas such as the digital economy with ASEAN and other countries involved in the Belt and Road Initiative.\nThis year, Indonesia, as ASEAN's rotating chair, has adopted the theme \"ASEAN Matters: Epicentrum of Growth\" and chosen digital economy cooperation as one of the priority agendas. At this historic juncture linking past achievements with prospects, China and ASEAN should work together to embrace and promote the new era of the digital economy.\nWe need to further strengthen the synergy of digital development strategies, enhance digital connectivity and build an integrated China-ASEAN digital market. We need to promote an exchange of experience and capacity-building training and improve rulemaking by agreeing on high-level digital rules.\nWe should push for lower tariffs, more efficient customs clearance, more connected payment methods and faster logistics and transportation so that more ordinary people and enterprises can enjoy the benefits of digital economy development.\nNext month, Jakarta will host the bloc\u2019s leaders\u2019 meetings on East Asia cooperation. We are ready to work with ASEAN countries at the meetings to promote fruitful results and push China-ASEAN digital economy cooperation to a new level.\n&nbsp;***\nThe author is Chinese Ambassador to ASEAN.\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nRelated Articles\nChina to curbs exports of key chipmaking components to US\nChina lifts final bans on Australian red meat as trade row nears end\nConfronting the climate crisis: Water as a lever for climate action\nASEAN, Canada work together for health security\nNo more cop-outs\nRelated Article\nChina to curbs exports of key chipmaking components to US\nChina lifts final bans on Australian red meat as trade row nears end\nConfronting the climate crisis: Water as a lever for climate action\nASEAN, Canada work together for health security\nNo more cop-outs\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nMore in Opinion\nView more\nAcademia\nThe bottom-up wave of democratic rejuvenation\nAcademia\nPolice brutality: Fundamental problems in the institution\nAcademia\nFree trade deals increase Indonesian imports more than exports\nHighlight\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEditorial\nNarrow margin\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nThe Latest\nView more\nEconomy\nChinese authorities are considering a weaker yuan as Trump trade risks loom, sources say\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia commences evacuation of 37 citizens in Damascus\nTech\nUS finalizes $6.1 billion Micron chip-making subsidy\nArchipelago\nTwo foreign visitors killed in tree collapse in Monkey Forest\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEconomy\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources\nRegulations\nBullion bank to launch in first half of next year, Airlangga says\nMiddle East and Africa\nAirline pilots, crews voice concerns about Middle East routes",

(The Straits Times/ANN/Lianhe Zaobao)\nA\nmong the upcoming annual post-ministerial conferences of the ASEAN Foreign Ministers\u2019 Meeting, the ASEAN-China Foreign Ministers\u2019 Meeting will be one of the most important events.\nAs President Xi Jinping pointed out in his congratulatory letter to the opening ceremony of ASEAN-China Year of Media Exchanges in February, ASEAN-China relations have entered a new stage of all-round development, which I believe can be characterized by the following points.\nFirst, the pathway of the development of ASEAN-China relations is clearer. Leaders of both sides are always in the driver\u2019s seat steering the development of ASEAN-China relations in the right direction. President Xi proposed to build a higher-level ASEAN-China strategic partnership and a closer ASEAN-China community with a shared future, charting the course of long-term development of these relations.\nSecond, strategic mutual trust is deeper. Leaders of China and ASEAN maintain frequent high-level exchanges. Besides intensive bilateral visits, leaders of the 10 ASEAN countries and the deputy secretary-general of the ASEAN Secretariat attended the second Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation last April, demonstrating the deep mutual trust between the two sides. We remain committed to resolving differences through dialogue and consultation and getting rid of external interference to jointly safeguard peace and stability in the South China Sea.\nWe have accelerated Code of Conduct (COC) consultations to jointly explore the formulation of regional rules at sea. We also held the first joint maritime exercise, as part of our efforts to enhance defense and security cooperation. Thanks to these concerted endeavors, the strategic mutual trust between the two sides has risen to an unprecedented new height.\nThird, economic and trade cooperation is growing faster. Against the backdrop of sluggish global growth and rising trade protectionism, ASEAN-China trade volume hit a record high in 2018, reaching US$587.8 billion, with a growth rate of 14.1 percent year-on-year. In the first half of 2019, landmark progress was achieved, with ASEAN overtaking the United States to become China\u2019s second-largest trading partner.\nTrade volume reached $291.85 billion in the first six months and is expected to exceed $600 billion by the end of the year. The industrial sectors in China and ASEAN, which are at difference stages of development, are increasingly complementary to each other.\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nRelated Articles\nDevelopments of Indonesia\u2019s OECD accession journey\nIs Beijing undermining Indonesia\u2019s free and active foreign policy?\nBali airport initiator signs HoA with Chinese company\nPrabowo needs US-model national security council\nPresident Prabowo calls Trump ahead of Biden meeting\nRelated Article\nDevelopments of Indonesia\u2019s OECD accession journey\nIs Beijing undermining Indonesia\u2019s free and active foreign policy?\nBali airport initiator signs HoA with Chinese company\nPrabowo needs US-model national security council\nPresident Prabowo calls Trump ahead of Biden meeting\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nMore in Academia\nView more\nAcademia\nThe bottom-up wave of democratic rejuvenation\nAcademia\nPolice brutality: Fundamental problems in the institution\nAcademia\nFree trade deals increase Indonesian imports more than exports\nHighlight\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEditorial\nNarrow margin\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nThe Latest\nView more\nEconomy\nRI identifies 29 potential nuclear power plant sites\nEconomy\nChinese authorities are considering a weaker yuan as Trump trade risks loom, sources say\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia commences evacuation of 37 citizens in Damascus\nTech\nUS finalizes $6.1 billion Micron chip-making subsidy\nArchipelago\nTwo foreign visitors killed in tree collapse in Monkey Forest\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEconomy\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources\nRegulations\nBullion bank to launch in first half of next year, Airlangga says",

The railway is to stretch about 142 kilometers from Jakarta to Bandung. (The Jakarta Post/Wienda Parwitasari)\nT\nhe 142.3-kilometer Jakarta-Bandung high-speed railway project is expected to become an excellent model of cooperation between China and Indonesia. When Indonesia chose China to carry out the project in September 2014, it was optimistically estimated that the megaproject, which would reportedly cost US$6.07 billion, would be completed by 2019.&nbsp;\nHowever, the project later faced many hurdles and was delayed for more than two years, raising the cost by 23 percent, according to Indonesian officials. This is a sensitive issue for both Indonesia and China. There is no doubt about China\u2019s technology mastery, but in terms of feasibility study and the knowledge about local sensitivity, China needs to pay more attention.\nChinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi assured visiting Maritime and Investment Coordinating Minister Luhut Pandjaitan on June 5 that the high-speed railway project would be completed in 2022 \u2014 a big relief for both sides. Hopefully, the two countries can reach a compromise on how the cost overrun can be shared. The success of the project will be a milestone for the two countries and prove that economic cooperation is indeed mutually beneficial.\nHowever, some tend to view China from a hostile perspective because of past experiences. Jakarta froze diplomatic ties with Beijing in the wake of an aborted coup attempt blamed on the Indonesian Communist Party (PKI) in 1965. Diplomatic relations were normalized on Aug. 8, 1990. China is moving closer to becoming the world\u2019s most powerful economy, and this has raised anxiety globally. It is just a natural phenomenon that has happened to other countries, such as the United States and Japan.\nWith President Joko \u201cJokowi\u201d Widodo already making plans to accompany Chinese President Xi Jinping on a trial run of the railway in 2022, when the latter is set to visit Indonesia to attend a Group of 20 summit, it is a strong show of assurance that there will be no more delays and that the project will be completed as planned \u2014 at any cost.\nThe President reportedly chose China over Japan for the project because he had learned from his experience as a businessman that Japan tended to be stingy in its transferring of technology to Indonesia. In 2014, it was almost certain that Japan would win the railway project because it had finished its feasibility study with a very cheap, long-term loan.\nJapan offered to cover 75 percent of the cost in long-term and soft loans. Its interest rate was just 0.1 percent and the loan term was 40 years. Repayment would start 11 years after the railway started operation. The project was included in Japan\u2019s Official Development Assistance (ODA) program. What bothered Jokowi was Japan\u2019s requirement that the loan be based on a government-to-government agreement, while China offered a business-to-business scheme.\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nRelated Articles\nChina, Indonesia open a new chapter of building a community with a shared future\nAsia\u2019s future in a challenging world\nChina\u2019s diplomacy: Building a community with a shared future for mankind\nWhoosh prices to fluctuate with customer demand\nHow BRI can give impetus to development in Indonesia\nRelated Article\nChina, Indonesia open a new chapter of building a community with a shared future\nAsia\u2019s future in a challenging world\nChina\u2019s diplomacy: Building a community with a shared future for mankind\nWhoosh prices to fluctuate with customer demand\nHow BRI can give impetus to development in Indonesia\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nMore in Academia\nView more\nAcademia\nThe bottom-up wave of democratic rejuvenation\nAcademia\nPolice brutality: Fundamental problems in the institution\nAcademia\nFree trade deals increase Indonesian imports more than exports\nHighlight\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEditorial\nNarrow margin\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nThe Latest\nView more\nEconomy\nRI identifies 29 potential nuclear power plant sites\nEconomy\nChinese authorities are considering a weaker yuan as Trump trade risks loom, sources say\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia commences evacuation of 37 citizens in Damascus\nTech\nUS finalizes $6.1 billion Micron chip-making subsidy\nArchipelago\nTwo foreign visitors killed in tree collapse in Monkey Forest\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEconomy\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources\nRegulations\nBullion bank to launch in first half of next year, Airlangga says",

(REUTERS/Aly Song)\nInstead of being hit by the pandemic, Asian countries are more united than ever before.\nThe novel coronavirus pandemic has cast doubt on the advancement of globalization. Some say that the international community will be further divided. Others predict that globalization is coming to an end. Such suggestions are irrational as we do not really have a choice but to strengthen cooperation, whether dealing with the threat of the virus or the challenges of the economic downturn. It is thus encouraging that Asian countries are strengthening international cooperation in the face of the strong headwinds.\nAsia was the first region to be hit by the pandemic. In addition to China, Thailand reported the first confirmed case as early as Jan. 8, followed by Japan, South Korea, Singapore, Malaysia and some other Asian countries. In general, cases were reported in Asia a week earlier than in European countries and the United States.\nThe responses of Asian countries have amazed the world. By mid-April, infected patients accounted for a much smaller percentage in Asia relative to some countries in other regions, indicating a more effective containment of the virus. While the mortality rate in major East Asian countries has been below 3 percent and even 1 percent in Singapore, other regions have a fatality rate of more than 5 percent or even 10 percent.\nWhy have Asian countries been more successful in containing the virus? For one thing, Asian governments have taken this dynamic situation very seriously and responded with swift, stringent and effective measures. In addition, nurtured by the culture of putting a premium on collective interest, social discipline and public order, people in Asia have done their bit to pull through this trying time, including complying with the prevention and control measures introduced by their governments.&nbsp;\nMost importantly, the fight against this scourge has been bolstered by the time-honored tradition and fine spirit of solidarity between Asian countries, especially in times of crisis. When the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) broke out in 2002-03, members of ASEAN-China, Japan and South Korea (10+3) came together to cooperate closely, sharing information and helping one another. Facing COVID-19, Asian countries have intensified their efforts, not just by sharing experiences and learning from one another but also by maintaining trade, keeping supply chains intact and donating medical and other emergency supplies needed to fight the virus.\nCooperation and coordination within the 10+3 and ASEAN-China (10+1) mechanisms are cases in point. On Feb. 20, the China-ASEAN Special Foreign Ministers' Meeting on fighting COVID-19 exchanged views on strengthening synergy between the health, quarantine, transportation and border control agencies of China and ASEAN, and discussed China's proposal to establish a China-ASEAN liaison mechanism for public health emergencies as well as China-ASEAN reserve centers for epidemic-control provisions.\nIn March, China, Japan and South Korea held special videoconferences on jointly responding to COVID-19 and agreed to, among other things, explore a joint prevention and control mechanism to effectively prevent the cross-border spread of the epidemic, seek mutually acceptable solutions to maintain necessary people-to-people exchanges related to economic cooperation and trade and stabilize the industrial chain and supply chain of the three countries.\nOn April 14, the 10+3 mechanism held a special summit and issued a joint statement outlining 18 goals as well as an action plan for further cooperation during and after the outbreak.\nThese are all great achievements from the perspective of an international observer.\nIt is fair to say that Asia has been a respectful community of shared interest and cooperation in the face of the sudden threat and subsequent challenges. For those who are overly pessimistic, the performance of Asian countries speaks volumes.\nOver the past decades, Asian countries have played more of a participating role in international institutions and mechanisms. Now with our region and the entire world facing not only a prominent health crisis but also the prospect of economic recession, and the erosion of social cohesion and multilateralism, there is a strong need to improve global governance. It is imperative that countries respond resolutely and firmly rise to these challenges and that international cooperation be enhanced. Undoubtedly, Asian countries can play a constructive or leading role.\nFirst, the existing regional cooperation mechanisms should be further integrated, such as ASEAN-China-Japan-South Korea, China-ASEAN, China-Japan-South Korea and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership.\nSecond, regional cooperation in Asia has to cope with the political challenges that plague our times, such as populism, nationalism, power politics and great power competition. Therefore, we must seek solutions to wealth inequality, the imbalance in international trade and the global economy, immigration and cultural conflicts while building the widest consensus on the new stage of globalization among different countries, ethnic groups and classes.\nFinally, Asian cooperation needs solid support in various fields involving agricultural products, aquatic products, health, financial trade, tourism, cultural industries, science and technology, energy, environment and sustainable development. Flexible and pragmatic policies under a comprehensive functional cooperation mechanism must be employed to deal with problems in development.\nChina is a big country in Asia that keeps learning and growing. It has not only gained great support from the neighboring countries but also learned its lessons. China sets a diplomatic goal of building a community with a shared future for mankind and continues to promote the Belt and Road Initiative, which is actually shared political concepts among Asian countries. A more capable and committed China will surely be an asset to Asia and the world.\nOver the past decades, the world has held special expectations for Asia, and most people are impressed with Asia's economic rise. Yet today, Asia represents not only a promising economic powerhouse of the global economy but a major opportunity for the promotion of human progress with its traditions, wisdom and values, especially in the political and cultural aspects.\nAt this critical moment in human history, will Asia overcome the challenges and achieve this? Taking a look at the wisdom and spirit shown in fighting against the virus, there is no doubt about it.\n***\nHu Zhengyue is former Chinese ambassador to Malaysia.

(REUTERS/Aly Song   )\nM\narch 19 was a special day. For the first time since the outbreak began, no new domestic transmissions of COVID-19 were reported in mainland China. This is truly a milestone in China\u2019s months-long battle against COVID-19.\nNo new domestic cases in a country of 1.4 billion people \u2014 that brings a strong sense of hope and confidence to the world, as it demonstrates that the disease is preventable, controllable and curable.\nFacing the spread of COVID-19 worldwide, China rises to fulfill its duties as a major and responsible country. China\u2019s concrete actions speak volumes of its resolve to promote the building of a community with a shared future for mankind. President Xi Jinping attaches great importance to the international cooperation in COVID-19 prevention and control and has kept close contact with other world leaders.\nChina\u2019s efficient and effective head-of-state diplomacy plays a unique and significant role at the unusual moment in promoting cooperation between China and other countries and deepening friendship between the Chinese people and peoples in the rest of the world.\nChina has donated US$20 million to the World Health Organization in support of disease prevention and control, in particular the public health systems of other developing countries. China has undertaken an enormous national mobilization to speed up production in response to the huge demand of global medical supplies.\nThe production capacity of masks has grown by five times in a short period of time, and the output of masks now exceeds 100 million per day. The production of protective gear and forehead thermometers, among other urgently needed supplies, has grown rapidly. Test kits are quickly being developed and put into mass production.\nWhile making every effort to combat the disease at home, China has endeavored to overcome difficulties and provide substantial assistance to other countries and regions where COVID-19 is taking a toll.\nChina and ASEAN member states have maintained close cooperation since the outbreak began, which demonstrates our traditional friendship of standing together in times of difficulties.\nIn recent days, China has been increasing assistance to ASEAN member states where COVID-19 has spread widely. On March 21, 100,000 test kits, 100,000 surgical masks, 10,000 N-95 masks and 10,000 sets of personal protective equipment donated by the Chinese government to the Philippines arrived in Manila. Foreign Secretary Teodoro Lopez Locsin, who attended the handover ceremony, called it \u201ctremendous help and invaluable support from China\u201d.\nOn March 23, seven medical experts, the first medical team sent by the Chinese government to an ASEAN member state, together with medical supplies, arrived in Phnom Penh.\nOn the same day, the first batch of medical supplies from China arrived in Indonesia. More assistance to Indonesia and the ASEAN Secretariat has also reached Jakarta.\nApart from the official assistance provided by the Chinese government, some local Chinese administrations, private entities and individuals have also extended a helping hand to ASEAN member states by donating a large amount of medical supplies and equipment. The quick assistance delivered through a streamlined process fully reflects the close bonds and deep friendship between our peoples.\nAt this critical moment when the world unites as one and fights the pandemic, there are also a few people with ulterior motives out there who deliberately link the novel coronavirus to China and stigmatize China nonstop, which the Chinese people are indignant at and strongly opposed to. The origin of the novel coronavirus is a matter of science that requires a scientific and professional assessment.\nThere is a clear consensus within the WHO and the international community that a virus shouldn\u2019t be linked to any specific country or region and that such stigmatization should be rejected. What those people have done will not help with international cooperation but only waste precious time that should be used to curb the pandemic, and it inflicts real harm on their own people and international cooperation.\nThe pandemic is still spreading worldwide. In the face of this severe, common test of mankind, China acts upon its profound convictions that mutual and timely assistance is of paramount importance and that kindness and gifts must be repaid.\nIn this spirit, China will continue to work with ASEAN and others in the international community to meet the challenge head-on, protect the health and safety of our people and strive for a community with a shared future for mankind.\n***\nAmbassador of the People\u2019s Republic of China to ASEAN\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nRelated Articles\nSingapore 'deeply invested' in Indonesia\u2019s success, PM says\nChinese premier in Hanoi agrees to boost ties with Vietnam\nInbound tourism soars to highest level since 2019: BPS\nPrabowo cozies up to Turkey on defense after Australia visit&nbsp;\nJapan to present low-carbon projects for ASEAN, Indonesia\nRelated Article\nSingapore 'deeply invested' in Indonesia\u2019s success, PM says\nChinese premier in Hanoi agrees to boost ties with Vietnam\nInbound tourism soars to highest level since 2019: BPS\nPrabowo cozies up to Turkey on defense after Australia visit&nbsp;\nJapan to present low-carbon projects for ASEAN, Indonesia\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nMore in Academia\nView more\nAcademia\nThe bottom-up wave of democratic rejuvenation\nAcademia\nPolice brutality: Fundamental problems in the institution\nAcademia\nFree trade deals increase Indonesian imports more than exports\nHighlight\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEditorial\nNarrow margin\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nThe Latest\nView more\nEconomy\nRI identifies 29 potential nuclear power plant sites\nEconomy\nChinese authorities are considering a weaker yuan as Trump trade risks loom, sources say\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia commences evacuation of 37 citizens in Damascus\nTech\nUS finalizes $6.1 billion Micron chip-making subsidy\nArchipelago\nTwo foreign visitors killed in tree collapse in Monkey Forest\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEconomy\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources\nRegulations\nBullion bank to launch in first half of next year, Airlangga says",

They also agreed to uphold open regionalism in Asia. And China reaffirmed its support for ASEAN centrality. All these are big deals.\nIf read carefully, the joint statement also mentioned documents signed by the two countries to sell Indonesian pineapples in the Chinese market. It may seem insignificant to some, but the fact that the business of a fruit needed to be taken care of during a meeting between the two heads of state points to their seriousness about strengthening economic and trade ties at all levels.\nThe aspiration for economic advancement is inherent in the planned paths of both countries. Indonesia is on its way to achieving Vision 2045, the country\u2019s roadmap to becoming a developed nation and one of the world\u2019s five biggest economies with near-zero poverty by the centenary of its independence.\nFrom the expansive stretch of railways on Sumatra to the enterprise of moving to a new capital, the nation\u2019s desire to achieve prosperity is palpable. And China\u2019s ambition of an innovative, digital and balanced economy is equally manifest in its 14\nth\nfive-year plan.\nPlus, foreign invasion or occupation are not distant memories for people of both nations. A shared sense is that peace was a hard-fought victory, won through blood and toil, that will be cherished every day and certainly not squandered away. And what is a better way to do that than by focusing on developing the economy so that everyone lives in affluence?\nThus, the joint statement issued during Jokowi\u2019s stay in Beijing addressed development issues with surgical precision. On the macro-level, it made sure that the two sides meet wherever they can in their respective national schemes and their thinking on regional blueprint: it stressed synergy of China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and Indonesia\u2019s Global Maritime Fulcrum; also, cooperation between the ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific and BRI.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nThen, apart from pineapples, it chopped up other details on railways, industrial parks, vaccines and fisheries under Indonesia\u2019s National Fish Barn project, among other things, and organized them in an orderly fashion.\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nRelated Articles\nXi says trade war with US will have 'no winners'\nAnalysis: Prabowo, Jokowi pull strings in regional head elections\nPrabowo\u2019s new approach to RI-China relations\nPresident Prabowo says he will safeguard sovereignty in South China Sea\nPeru's Chancay: China's megaport of entry to South America\nRelated Article\nXi says trade war with US will have 'no winners'\nAnalysis: Prabowo, Jokowi pull strings in regional head elections\nPrabowo\u2019s new approach to RI-China relations\nPresident Prabowo says he will safeguard sovereignty in South China Sea\nPeru's Chancay: China's megaport of entry to South America\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nMore in Opinion\nView more\nAcademia\nThe bottom-up wave of democratic rejuvenation\nAcademia\nPolice brutality: Fundamental problems in the institution\nAcademia\nFree trade deals increase Indonesian imports more than exports\nHighlight\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEditorial\nNarrow margin\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nThe Latest\nView more\nEconomy\nRI identifies 29 potential nuclear power plant sites\nEconomy\nChinese authorities are considering a weaker yuan as Trump trade risks loom, sources say\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia commences evacuation of 37 citizens in Damascus\nTech\nUS finalizes $6.1 billion Micron chip-making subsidy\nArchipelago\nTwo foreign visitors killed in tree collapse in Monkey Forest\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEconomy\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources\nRegulations\nBullion bank to launch in first half of next year, Airlangga says",

(Reuters/Pool/Sputnik/Sergey Bobylev)\nR\necently, the 22nd Meeting of the Council of Heads of State of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) was successfully held in Samarkand, Uzbekistan, where Chinese President Xi Jinping, together with leaders of other SCO member states, reviewed achievements, summarized experience, and drew new blueprints. During this period, openness and inclusiveness were the frequently mentioned keywords.\nOpenness and inclusiveness have contributed to the vigorous development of the SCO. Founded over 20 years ago, SCO member states have always upheld the Shanghai Spirit featuring mutual trust, mutual benefit, equality, consultation, respect for the diversity of civilizations and pursuit of common development, committed to political trust, mutually beneficial cooperation, equality, openness and inclusiveness, and equity and justice, and promoted \u201cdialogue and cooperation in an interconnected world\u201d as Uzbek President Shavkat Mirziyoyev wrote in his op-ed recently published in\nThe Jakarta Post.\nThe SCO member states, with their diverse national conditions and cultures, have been able to stay together and attract the attention and the application for joining of more like-minded countries because of their adherence to open and inclusive multilateralism. This is the important foundation for the SCO\u2019s development and growth.\nOpenness and inclusiveness are also the secrets of successful East Asia cooperation. Since the establishment of the East Asia regional cooperation mechanism, all parties have made remarkable development achievements by adhering to the vision of\u2002peace, development, independence and inclusiveness, and upholding open regionalism.\nASEAN countries have created and led the East Asia regional cooperation mechanism, and also promoted the formation of the ASEAN development philosophy and ways of interaction featuring a development-first approach, mutually beneficial cooperation and mutual respect.\nChina has always supported ASEAN\u2019s community building, supported the ASEAN-centered regional cooperation architecture. Last year, China and ASEAN established the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership. With the concerted efforts of the two sides to build a peaceful, safe and secure, prosperous, beautiful and amicable home together, China-ASEAN cooperation will certainly continue to be at the forefront of the times and offer strong guidance to East Asia cooperation.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nChina will always uphold the spirit of openness and inclusiveness in regional and international cooperation. As an advocate, a participant, and a beneficiary of global development cooperation, China will always pursue an opening-up strategy of win-win cooperation, and actively participate in regional and global cooperation. In response to the common and urgent issues of development and security faced by the international community,\nChina has proposed the Global Development Initiative and the Global Security Initiative, calling on all countries to stay true to\u2002the vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security and build a balanced, effective and sustainable security architecture, and also calling on all parties to foster global development partnership, and achieve more robust, greener and more balanced global development, thus effectively promoting international cooperation and addressing common challenges.\nChina is willing to take the implementation of relevant initiatives as an opportunity to deepen solidarity and cooperation with ASEAN and other relevant parties, practice multilateralism with a clear attitude and firm actions, and promote the building of a community with a shared future for mankind.\nSeclusion and isolation will only lead to rigidity and backwardness, while inclusiveness and openness will bring mutual benefit and win-win results. In order to maintain its own hegemony, the United States is engaged in geopolitical contests and bloc confrontation, which goes against the spirit of openness and inclusiveness.\nWe should remain highly vigilant in this regard and prevent it from hindering the international community\u2019s joint response to challenges, the healthy development of international relations and transformation of the international order toward justice and equity.\nAs a Chinese saying goes, \u201cAdvancing with the times opens up new horizons\u201d. China is ready to work with regional countries to uphold open and inclusive regionalism and jointly promote peace, stability, development and prosperity in the region and the world.\n&nbsp;***\nThe author is Chinese Ambassador to ASEAN.\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nRelated Articles\nPrabowo\u2019s great power politics pivot takes center stage\nA new journey in China-Indonesia relationship: Building a shared future\nPrabowo calls meeting with regional heads\nSampoerna\u2019s tobacco partnership program boosts Wonogiri economy\nGermany bets on India to reduce reliance on China\nRelated Article\nPrabowo\u2019s great power politics pivot takes center stage\nA new journey in China-Indonesia relationship: Building a shared future\nPrabowo calls meeting with regional heads\nSampoerna\u2019s tobacco partnership program boosts Wonogiri economy\nGermany bets on India to reduce reliance on China\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nMore in Opinion\nView more\nAcademia\nThe bottom-up wave of democratic rejuvenation\nAcademia\nPolice brutality: Fundamental problems in the institution\nAcademia\nFree trade deals increase Indonesian imports more than exports\nHighlight\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEditorial\nNarrow margin\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nThe Latest\nView more\nEconomy\nRI identifies 29 potential nuclear power plant sites\nEconomy\nChinese authorities are considering a weaker yuan as Trump trade risks loom, sources say\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia commences evacuation of 37 citizens in Damascus\nTech\nUS finalizes $6.1 billion Micron chip-making subsidy\nArchipelago\nTwo foreign visitors killed in tree collapse in Monkey Forest\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEconomy\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources\nRegulations\nBullion bank to launch in first half of next year, Airlangga says",

(REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton)\nC\nOVID-19 has brought formidable threats to the life and health of people all over the world. Amid the fierce struggle between the human race and a major global epidemic, unity and cooperation is more needed than ever.\nThe novel coronavirus is a new type of virus. Our knowledge of it is growing yet still limited. China, too, in acquiring an understanding of the virus, went through a painful process, which is not exceptional in the pursuit of honest knowledge and scientific facts.\nDuring this process, China has been actively engaging in international cooperation in controlling and combating the pandemic with the spirit of openness, transparency and responsibility \u2013 China identified the pathogen within an extraordinarily limited time and released its genome sequence as soon as possible; China has been updating the World Health Organization and the international community on its COVID-19 status since Jan. 3; China has so far published seven editions of a diagnosis and treatment plan and six editions of a prevention and control plan for COVID-19, all multilingual.\nChina\u2019s prompt information-sharing is a manifestation of its commitment to unity and cooperation, which enabled the international community to gain a head-start in detecting, preventing and combating COVID-19.\nViruses do not respect borders, nor do epidemics discriminate between races. As United Nations Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres has acknowledged, we are facing a global health crisis unlike any in the 75-year history of the UN \u2013 one that is spreading human suffering, infecting the global economy and upending people\u2019s lives.\nIndeed, in today\u2019s deeply connected world, no country can stand apart from such a virus that is spreading at an unprecedented speed and scope. From virus source tracing to building a collective global response for disease control and treatment, from identifying the best treatment to producing more medical supplies and seeking breakthroughs in vaccine development, no single country alone can do it all.\nBracing for the impact of the pandemic on the global economy, all countries are on the same boat. Countries need to leverage and coordinate their macro policies to counteract the negative impact, better coordinate financial regulation, keep the global industrial and supply chains stable and thus send a strong signal and restore confidence for global economic recovery. The key to dispersing the shadows of the pandemic hinges on whether the international community can work in unity and render mutual assistance.\nHumanity is a community with a shared future, as Chinese President Xi Jinping said, only by cooperating and responding together can the international community overcome the pandemic. China is committed by both words and deeds. When China fought an uphill battle at home, it has been supporting the global combat against COVID-19 to the best of its ability.\nAs of April 12, 83 video conferences had been held for medical experts between China and 153 other countries, including Indonesia; 14 Chinese medical teams were sent to 12 countries including Cambodia, the Philippines, Myanmar and Laos so that combat experience against the virus can be shared and put in use; China has provided more than 150 countries and international organizations with much needed medical supplies, and has been facilitating the procurement of medical supplies through commercial channels by all countries in China.\nFrom March 1 to April 10 alone, China exported 7.12 billion face masks, 55.57 million pieces of protective clothing, 3.59 million infrared thermometers, 20,100 ventilators, and 13.69 million protective goggles. China is contributing to a sustained global combat against COVID-19.\nAt the end of the day, we may ask: Where does the virus come from? It is a question that should be answered by the science community, utilizing scientific knowledge and methods. More importantly, the purpose of answering that question is to better control the pandemic and save lives, not to facilitate political maneuvers.\nIn the face of this global crisis, some western politicians are stigmatizing others, even passing the buck to others for selfish gains. Such actions would not help with their domestic situation, but undermine global cooperation in combating COVID-19, thus eventually harming all countries.\nUnder the shadows of the COVID-19 pandemic, no single country can stand alone unaffected. Unity and cooperation is the best way for the human race to prevail.\n***\nChinese ambassador to Indonesia\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nRelated Articles\nPandemic treaty talks round wrapping up without a breakthrough\nWhat Trump\u2019s win means for Indonesia\u2019s global health strategy\nWhy corruption could derail Indonesia\u2019s climate fight\nDharma Pongrekun unrepentant over unfounded claims\nThe education policy that could make a difference\nRelated Article\nPandemic treaty talks round wrapping up without a breakthrough\nWhat Trump\u2019s win means for Indonesia\u2019s global health strategy\nWhy corruption could derail Indonesia\u2019s climate fight\nDharma Pongrekun unrepentant over unfounded claims\nThe education policy that could make a difference\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nMore in Academia\nView more\nAcademia\nThe bottom-up wave of democratic rejuvenation\nAcademia\nPolice brutality: Fundamental problems in the institution\nAcademia\nFree trade deals increase Indonesian imports more than exports\nHighlight\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEditorial\nNarrow margin\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nThe Latest\nView more\nEconomy\nRI identifies 29 potential nuclear power plant sites\nEconomy\nChinese authorities are considering a weaker yuan as Trump trade risks loom, sources say\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia commences evacuation of 37 citizens in Damascus\nTech\nUS finalizes $6.1 billion Micron chip-making subsidy\nArchipelago\nTwo foreign visitors killed in tree collapse in Monkey Forest\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEconomy\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources\nRegulations\nBullion bank to launch in first half of next year, Airlangga says",

(The Jakarta Post/Umair Rizaludin )\nS\ntate-owned railway operator PT Kereta Api Indonesia (KAI) will build a new train line to connect Kebon Kawung Station in the city of Bandung, West Java, to Tegalluar Station in Bandung regency, which will be the final station of the Jakarta-Bandung high-speed railway that is currently under development.\n\"We've prepared diesel trains to connect [Bandung\u2019s ] Kebon Kawung Station to Tegalluar Station, which are 16.2 kilometers apart,\" KAI president director Edi Sukmoro said on Monday as reported by&nbsp;\nKompas.com\n.\nEdi said the journey between Tegalluar and Kebon Kawung stations would take only 27 minutes. \"We've prepared five trains, each with a capacity of 300 passengers. We can raise the capacity if the number of passengers increases,\" he said.\nKAI needs to construct 4.2 km of new tracks, half of which will be elevated, to connect Tegalluar and Kebon Kawung stations, Edi said.\nThe new tracks will be built on land already owned by KAI so land acquisition will not be necessary, he added.\nThe funding for the project will come from the Jakarta-Bandung high-speed railway consortium.\n\"We will invest around Rp 4 trillion [US$285.3 million] for the new tracks because around 2 km&nbsp;will be elevated,\u201d Edi said.&nbsp;\n\u201cThe consortium will take care of the project. However, we invite the local administration to take part,\u201d he said, adding that the involvement of local stakeholders would prove beneficial to the project.&nbsp;\nHe said the company also envisioned the new line being connected to the Al Jabbar floating mosque in Bandung, which will open to the public in 2020.\nTo make the vision come to life, KAI plans to move Cimekar Station 1 km west of its current location to be behind the mosque.\nThe planned Tegalluar-Bandung line and the Jakarta-Bandung high-speed railway are expected to be completed in 2021.

(Antara/Rosa Panggabean)\nC\nhina is ready to bring greater closeness to the China-ASEAN Community of Shared Destiny to make it an example within the Asian Community of Shared Destiny, President Xi Jinping said on Tuesday.\nXi made the pledge when sending congratulations on the 50th anniversary of ASEAN\u2019s founding in a message to Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, whose country has ASEAN\u2019s rotating chairmanship this year.\nAs a sign of the booming ties between China and the 10-country group, China has been ASEAN\u2019s largest trade partner for eight years.\nTheir trade amounted to US$452.2 billion last year, and currently about 2,700 flights connect China and the 10 countries in every week.\nXi said that since their dialogue partnership was built in 1991, China and ASEAN have stayed true to cooperation and development, their political mutual trust has deepened and their pragmatic cooperation has seen fruitful outcomes.&nbsp;\n\u201cChina-ASEAN ties have become one of the most vigorous and enriched dialogue partnerships of ASEAN,\u201d Xi added.\nHe noted that ASEAN has played an important role in securing regional peace and stability since its founding half a century ago, and it has become a force that represents the world\u2019s developing multipolar nature.&nbsp;\nChina expects greater development of the ASEAN community, which will contribute more to regional peace, stability and prosperity and better benefit the people of its member countries, Xi said.\nAs next year marks the 15th anniversary of China and ASEAN establishing their strategic partnership, Xi said China would like to take the year as an opportunity to appreciate all that has been accomplished and look at what can be done over the long run.\nIn Manila on Tuesday, Foreign Minister Wang Yi attended the grand celebration of ASEAN\u2019s 50th anniversary along with his counterparts from ASEAN and other nations.\nDuterte said, \u201cWe seek to engage with our neighbors positively in dialogue partnerships that continue to grow.\u201d\nPhilippine Foreign Secretary Alan Peter Cayetano told reporters on Tuesday that \u201cChina plays a very positive role\u201d in the region.\n\u201cChina has shown economic strength ... in the last decades, its economy has also fueled our growth in ASEAN with tourism from China, manufacturing and infrastructure projects,\u201d he said.\nIn regard to the South China Sea situation, Cayetano said, \u201cAll the positive sides China has given to the relationship with ASEAN will not be disturbed\u201d because of disputes there.\n\u201cWe will not allow this to disturb our good relationships,\u201d he said.\nWang said on Monday night that with the joint efforts of China and ASEAN countries, the situation in the South China Sea has been stabilized, and pragmatic cooperation has unfolded.\nThis article appeared on the China Daily newspaper website, which is a member of Asia News Network and a media partner of The Jakarta Post\n&nbsp;\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nRelated Articles\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nFree trade deals increase Indonesian imports more than exports\nIndonesia\u2019s tourist sector: A new era of innovation and growth\nPresident Prabowo should make Indonesia a global champion of democracy\nNew mosque in Nusantara to replace Istiqlal as state mosque\nRelated Article\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nFree trade deals increase Indonesian imports more than exports\nIndonesia\u2019s tourist sector: A new era of innovation and growth\nPresident Prabowo should make Indonesia a global champion of democracy\nNew mosque in Nusantara to replace Istiqlal as state mosque\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nHighlight\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEditorial\nNarrow margin\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nThe Latest\nView more\nEconomy\nRI identifies 29 potential nuclear power plant sites\nEconomy\nChinese authorities are considering a weaker yuan as Trump trade risks loom, sources say\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia commences evacuation of 37 citizens in Damascus\nTech\nUS finalizes $6.1 billion Micron chip-making subsidy\nArchipelago\nTwo foreign visitors killed in tree collapse in Monkey Forest\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEconomy\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources\nRegulations\nBullion bank to launch in first half of next year, Airlangga says",

(Reuters/China Daily)\nNo one should underestimate the importance of president-elect\nPrabowo Subianto\n's visit to China and Japan this week.\nHis meetings with Chinese President Xi Jinping and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida demonstrate his intent to maintain an economic-heavy foreign policy but also to infuse global security and defense perspectives amid the growing tension between China and the United States.\nLike many other countries, including even some in the developed world, Indonesia cannot avoid a heavy dependence on China for trade, investment and government-to-government economic cooperation. Prabowo knows this and he has chosen to piggyback on Jokowi and Xi's personal relationship.\nPrabowo achieved a major diplomatic coup by securing a bilateral meeting with&nbsp;Xi, the supreme leader of the world's second-largest economy and Indonesia\u2019s most important economic partner.&nbsp;&nbsp;\nThe meeting with Kishida should also be seen as&nbsp;a victory for Prabowo, considering Japan's position as the fourth-largest economy and as a country that has invested in Indonesia for decades.&nbsp;\nThe feeling was mutual. Xi is certainly enthusiastic about Prabowo because he can expect a continuation of President Jokowi's policies.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nOne major subject that came up during the meeting was the Whoosh high-speed railway (HSR) from Jakarta to Bandung which Xi saw as an&nbsp;example&nbsp;of \"high-quality bilateral cooperation\" and that the project marked \"a new stage of building a community with a shared future.\"\nXi also told Prabowo, a former military general who was once considered a Washington protege,&nbsp;that \"the key to successful China-Indonesia relations is to adhere to strategic independence, mutual trust and mutual assistance, win-win cooperation and fairness and justice.\"\nAfter meeting Xi on Monday, in his capacity as defense minister, Prabowo held talks with several Chinese senior officials including his Chinese counterpart Dong Jun and&nbsp;Prime Minister Li Qiang.\nIn these meetings, Prabowo again reiterated his&nbsp;support for&nbsp;a closer relationship with China and pledged to continue Indonesia's friendly policies toward China\n.\nThe ties between Indonesia and China are not without problems.\nThere is a growing concern over the imbalanced economic ties between the two countries. But before blaming Beijing, the Indonesian government should make an honest assessment of its shortcomings on closing the gap. Too often we complain about unfair treatment from other countries without trying to fix our internal problems.\nAnd then, of course the issue of the&nbsp;Natuna islands, where China claims its fishermen have navigated for centuries. The United Nations has recognized Indonesia's exclusive economic zone (EEZ) rights on the resources-rich body of water, but&nbsp;the two countries must ensure the difference will not&nbsp;adversely impact their bilateral relationship.\nFrom the Beijing visit, we can also see that as the de-facto leader of ASEAN, Prabowo wants to maintain Indonesia's regional leadership while maximizing its position as a middle power in the Indo-Pacific. Indonesia is too important on the world stage to simply stick to one regional bloc.\nPrabowo is cognizant that US President Joe Biden has paid a special attention to him. We can see this from how he congratulated Prabowo soon after&nbsp;the General Elections Commission (KPU) announced the final tally last month.\nWe can also expect that Prabowo will go to Washington, DC before October to reaffirm Indonesia's free and active foreign policy and send a clear message that Indonesia and the region still needs a US presence.\nHis meeting with Kishida, a staunch ally of Biden in the region,&nbsp;and his Japanese counterpart Minoru Kihara should be seen as a precursor to that balancing act.\nThis is also a diplomatic coup for Prabowo, simply because of&nbsp;Japan's position as the world's fourth largest economy and one of Indonesia's most important trade and investment&nbsp;partners.&nbsp;\nThe Japanese government has welcomed Prabowo warmly. \"Indonesia is a comprehensive strategic partner [of Japan] that shares fundamental principles and values, \u201cchief cabinet secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi said on Monday.\nPrabowo's two-country trip this week is a very positive step in laying the groundwork for the larger diplomatic arena that he will navigate once he takes office in October.\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nRelated Articles\nPrabowo calls for more prudent government spending amid global tensions\nReengineering culture to sustain Prabowo\u2019s leadership\nGovt\u2019s pitch to foreign housing developers no easy sell\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nPLN Nusantara Power Showcases Solar PV projects at Japan RE Invest 2024\nRelated Article\nPrabowo calls for more prudent government spending amid global tensions\nReengineering culture to sustain Prabowo\u2019s leadership\nGovt\u2019s pitch to foreign housing developers no easy sell\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nPLN Nusantara Power Showcases Solar PV projects at Japan RE Invest 2024\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nMore in Opinion\nView more\nAcademia\nThe bottom-up wave of democratic rejuvenation\nAcademia\nPolice brutality: Fundamental problems in the institution\nAcademia\nFree trade deals increase Indonesian imports more than exports\nHighlight\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEditorial\nNarrow margin\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nThe Latest\nView more\nEconomy\nRI identifies 29 potential nuclear power plant sites\nEconomy\nChinese authorities are considering a weaker yuan as Trump trade risks loom, sources say\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia commences evacuation of 37 citizens in Damascus\nTech\nUS finalizes $6.1 billion Micron chip-making subsidy\nArchipelago\nTwo foreign visitors killed in tree collapse in Monkey Forest\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEconomy\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources\nRegulations\nBullion bank to launch in first half of next year, Airlangga says",

(AFP/Ludovic Marin)\nW\ne are currently celebrating the 61st anniversary of the Elys\u00e9e Treaty, signed on Jan. 22, 1963, by then French president Charles de Gaulle and German chancellor Konrad Adenauer, to seal the reconciliation between France and Germany. The two countries were long considered sworn enemies and&nbsp;had clashed in three major wars in 1870, in World War I from 1914 to 1918, and then in World War II from 1939 to 1945.\nThe Elys\u00e9e Treaty instituted regular consultations between Germany and France on key issues such as defense, education and youth, which have helped nurture the development of structuring cooperation between the two countries and fostered&nbsp;the process of building the European Union.\nAt a time when the French and German populations were still severely scarred by the consequences of war, this reconciliation was made possible by the strong political will expressed by the German and French leaders of the time to lay the foundations for a lasting peace between the two states, guaranteeing their prosperity and the well-being of their citizens.\nThis ambition was first and foremost for the benefit of young people in both countries, to ensure that they were spared the suffering endured by their elders and offered the perspective of a shared future.\nThe Franco-German Office for Youth, created in 1963, has played a major role in the development of exchanges between our two countries. Since then, over 9&nbsp;million young people from France and Germany have taken part in exchange programs.\nMore recently, historians from both countries contributed to the publication of a joint history book in 2006, helping to develop a truly shared vision of the history of our two nations among schoolchildren in both countries.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nThese groundbreaking initiatives, launched in the 1960s, have brought successive generations of young Germans and French closer together over the long term and helped change the way each population views the other. In this way, a solid and fruitful friendship between our two peoples has gradually taken root, to the benefit of strengthening bilateral relations and the construction of Europe.\nToday, this ambition is intact and continues to strive through the joint efforts of Germany and France for a sovereign Europe, ever more united, supportive, and strong in the face of the challenges of an unstable contemporary world fraught with tensions.\nThis is reflected in the provisions of the Franco-German Aachen Treaty of Jan. 22, 2019, which was adopted to complement and strengthen the Elys\u00e9e Treaty, particularly in the fields of economic, energy and environmental policy, and to foster ever-closer ties between our two peoples. Around the same time and guided by a similar ambition, our national parliaments established a Parliamentary Assembly common to both countries.\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, this strengthened Franco-German cooperation made it possible to build a joint health and economic response to ensure that Europe emerges stronger from the pandemic.\nFrom the outset of Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine, with the aid given to Kyiv and the sanctions imposed on Russia due to its flagrant violation of international law, first and foremost the principles of respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of states, France and Germany have also demonstrated their unwavering support for Ukraine, whose destiny is linked to that of Europe as a whole.&nbsp;\nWith regard to the situation in the Middle East, the German and French foreign ministers reiterated, during their exchange in Berlin on Jan. 14, the mobilization of Germany and France to support peace efforts. To provide immediate assistance to the population of Gaza, the European Union provided&nbsp;over 100 million euros (US$108.64 million) in humanitarian aid in 2023, alongside substantial contributions by many European countries, including France and Germany.\nFaithful to the original promise of the Elys\u00e9e Treaty, France and Germany intend to embody as much as possible a community of destiny in Europe, based on dialogue, cooperation and solidarity.\nAlongside their allies and foreign partners, they also remain determined to promote and defend an international order based on the principles of the United Nations Charter, to the benefit of the prosperity and well-being of all the peoples of the world.\n***\nFabien Penone is French ambassador to Indonesia, ASEAN and Timor-Leste.

The BPOM has the preeminent job in controlling it, but the reality is drugs aren'\u0080\u0099t controlled well. The BPOM must engage in cooperation with other agencies like the police and organizations like the Indonesian Pharmacy Organization because Indonesia is too large to be handled only by the BPOM.\nJacko Atmaja\nWe should appreciate what the BPOM has done. They should continue such operations in order to clear the market from these illegal products, especially traditional medicines, the fact is the BPOM found a lot of jamu (traditional medicines) that contain chemicals.\nIt'\u0080\u0099s a good step for the BPOM to confiscate all the illegal products. Moreover, we hope that the government will also take action to stop the factories that produce illegal medicines.\nRicha Christi\nThe government should act harder against illegal factories, Consumers are in danger from illegal cosmetics and medicines.\nRiski Widi\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nRelated Articles\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nFree trade deals increase Indonesian imports more than exports\nIndonesia\u2019s tourist sector: A new era of innovation and growth\nPresident Prabowo should make Indonesia a global champion of democracy\nNew mosque in Nusantara to replace Istiqlal as state mosque\nRelated Article\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nFree trade deals increase Indonesian imports more than exports\nIndonesia\u2019s tourist sector: A new era of innovation and growth\nPresident Prabowo should make Indonesia a global champion of democracy\nNew mosque in Nusantara to replace Istiqlal as state mosque\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nMore in News\nView more\nOpinion\nAnalysis: Govt adopts mandatory B35 biodiesel program as CPO prices tumble\nBusiness\nGlobal chip crunch stunts Indonesia car sales recovery\nBusiness\nXL profit falls in Q3 as tower sale income dries\nHighlight\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEditorial\nNarrow margin\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nThe Latest\nView more\nEconomy\nRI identifies 29 potential nuclear power plant sites\nEconomy\nChinese authorities are considering a weaker yuan as Trump trade risks loom, sources say\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia commences evacuation of 37 citizens in Damascus\nTech\nUS finalizes $6.1 billion Micron chip-making subsidy\nArchipelago\nTwo foreign visitors killed in tree collapse in Monkey Forest\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEconomy\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources\nRegulations\nBullion bank to launch in first half of next year, Airlangga says",

(AFP/Nhac Nguyen)\nT\nhe period from August to September marks a significant period for both Indonesia and Vietnam historically. After Sukarno proclaimed Indonesian independence on Aug. 17, 1945, Ho Chi Minh declared the independence of Vietnam on Sept. 2 of the same year.\nLooking back at the past decade, Indonesia and Vietnam have enjoyed strong economic cooperation. Driven by our strong partnership and rapid economic development, bilateral trade and investment have grown exponentially. In 2023, bilateral trade reached US$13.8 billion in 2023, exceeding the target of $10 billion set by the leaders of both countries. Two-way investment between the countries also reached unprecedented figures.\nThis year marks a milestone for Indonesia-Vietnam bilateral relations, with President Joko \u201cJokowi\u201d Widodo making a state visit to Hanoi in January. The key takeaway of the visit was the commitment to promote cooperation and collaboration to achieve the shared vision of becoming high-income countries by 2045.\nAs a follow-up to this visit, ministers of the two ASEAN countries have met to discuss the ways forward. This includes setting a new bilateral trade target of $18 billion by 2028 - reflecting our success in achieving the previous target.\nThe fulfillment of this new target lies in promoting cooperation on five key sectors that we consider the priority of Indonesia-Vietnam economic cooperation, namely agriculture, fisheries, renewable energy, the digital economy and high-tech industries.\nWith a combined population of more than 380 million, food security serves as a key foundation of economic development for both Indonesia and Vietnam.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nAs developing countries, agriculture and fisheries play important roles in ensuring national food security. In this sense, cooperation between the two countries should be focused on supporting each other and exploring ways to increase productivity. Moreover, being among the largest rice and fish producers in the world, cooperation between Indonesia and Vietnam is essential to not only ensure domestic sufficiency, but also regional food security.\nAmid rapid economic growth, however, Indonesia and Vietnam must be able to address the issues of sustainability.\nAs industrialization tends to jeopardize air quality and environmental sustainability, Indonesia has set a net-zero emissions target by 2060 and Vietnam by 2050. Both countries are currently exploring ways to reach this target, to accelerate the transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy.\nWhile commitments to reach these targets exist, their implementation remains a challenge. To this end, both countries need to double down on efforts in the energy transition, including exchanging best practices and sharing experiences, particularly on the implementation of the Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP) framework, in which Indonesia and Vietnam are partners.\nFurthermore, today the availability of renewable energy and efforts toward energy transition also become key elements in attracting quality investment, as investors now consider environmental, social, governance (ESG) issues a deciding factor for investment.\nGiven the strong demography of the working age population, cooperation in the digital economy is also a huge potential for both countries. Start-ups in both countries are rising at a rapid pace, and this positive momentum should be harnessed effectively.\nWith a more integrated digital economy, Indonesia and Vietnam can promote cross-border payments and transactions, which will speed up economic activities between both countries.\nTo fulfill the aspirations to become developed economies, it is important for both countries to focus on producing high value-added products, based on technology. Both Indonesia and Vietnam are developing their own expertise.\nFor instance, Vietnam\u2019s electric vehicles, which are already entering Indonesia\u2019s market, or Indonesia\u2019s animal pharmaceutical businesses, one of which has just completed building the largest animal vaccine factory in Vietnam this year. The two countries should complement each other and together contribute to building a regional single production base in Southeast Asia.\nBeyond 2024, amid the challenges, the prospect for Indonesia-Vietnam economic relations will continue to shine bright. New leaderships following the inauguration of Vietnam\u2019s President To Lam in May 2024, followed by the inauguration of Indonesia\u2019s new president in October 2024, are expected to invigorate cooperation between both countries.\nIndonesia\u2019s president-elect\nPrabowo Subianto\nis expected to continue the success of existing programs while adding extra focus on other sectors, such as promoting the development of human resources from early years. These extra sectors will create new avenues for Indonesia and Vietnam cooperation.\nBy riding the positive wave of the demographic bonus, the shared vision to become high-income countries, and the passion of the people, I am positive of the future of Indonesia and Vietnam.\nNext year, Indonesia and Vietnam will celebrate an important milestone in our long-forged relationship, 70 years of diplomatic relations. This is a great opportunity for both countries to strengthen the partnership into higher levels.\nWhile in the region, the increasing influence of Indonesia and Vietnam will be one of the key foundations for ASEAN to maintain its stability, centrality and unity. Hence promoting stability and security must continue to be at the top of the list for both countries, both in the bilateral context and in the context of ASEAN.\nIn this sense I am confident that both Indonesia and Vietnam will continue to be fully committed to contributing to peace, stability and prosperity in the ASEAN region and beyond.\n***\nThe writer is Indonesian ambassador to Vietnam\n.\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nRelated Articles\nMake farming profitable again\nActivists protest rejection of dog and cat meat trade ban\nMeaningful digital transformation for the Asia-Pacific region\nState budget financing remains on track to protect welfare, maintain stability\nA Trump return would threaten global fight against climate change\nRelated Article\nMake farming profitable again\nActivists protest rejection of dog and cat meat trade ban\nMeaningful digital transformation for the Asia-Pacific region\nState budget financing remains on track to protect welfare, maintain stability\nA Trump return would threaten global fight against climate change\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nMore in Opinion\nView more\nAcademia\nThe bottom-up wave of democratic rejuvenation\nAcademia\nPolice brutality: Fundamental problems in the institution\nAcademia\nFree trade deals increase Indonesian imports more than exports\nHighlight\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEditorial\nNarrow margin\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nThe Latest\nView more\nEconomy\nRI identifies 29 potential nuclear power plant sites\nEconomy\nChinese authorities are considering a weaker yuan as Trump trade risks loom, sources say\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia commences evacuation of 37 citizens in Damascus\nTech\nUS finalizes $6.1 billion Micron chip-making subsidy\nArchipelago\nTwo foreign visitors killed in tree collapse in Monkey Forest\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEconomy\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources\nRegulations\nBullion bank to launch in first half of next year, Airlangga says",

(Reuters/China Daily)\nVersi Bahasa Indonesia\nP\nresident-elect\nPrabowo Subianto\nvisited Beijing on Monday on his first foreign trip since his election, and was quoted by Chinese state media as telling President Xi Jinping he aimed to continue the close ties under predecessor Joko \"Jokowi\" Widodo.\nPrabowo \"fully supports the development of closer&nbsp;Indonesia-China relations and wishes to continue President Joko's policy of friendship with China,\" China's CCTV quoted Prabowo as saying.\nThe new&nbsp;Indonesian government will promote the alignment of development strategies between the two countries and push for more results in cooperation in fields such as the economy, trade and poverty alleviation, he said.\nPrabowo, now a defence minister, also said that he viewed China as a key partner.\n\"Regarding defence cooperation, I view China as one of the key partners in ensuring regional peace and stability,\" he said in a statement, adding that he sought to boost defence cooperations with China.\n\"I also commit to fulfil the needs of&nbsp;Indonesia's military hardware, boost cooperation in the defence industry and establish productive dialogues,\" he added.&nbsp;\nXi described Prabowo as an \"old friend of the Chinese people\" and said China views its relations with&nbsp;Indonesia&nbsp;from a strategic and long-term perspective, standing ready to deepen all-round strategic cooperation.\nXi also told Prabowo that bilateral ties \"have entered a new stage of jointly building a community with a shared future\", state broadcaster CCTV reported.\nChina \"is willing to deepen all-round strategic cooperation with Indonesia and build a China-Indonesia community with... regional and global influence, so as to bring more benefits to the two peoples and make positive contributions to regional and world peace and development,\" Xi said.\nPrabowo, 72, was elected in February but will not be sworn in until October. A long-time rival of the outgoing leader Jokowi, he is now widely seen as enjoying his predecessor's strong support, winning his decisive victory with Jokowi's son as his vice presidential running-mate.\n\"The key to the valuable achievements of China-Indonesia&nbsp;relations lies in adherence to strategic autonomy, mutual trust and mutual assistance,\" CCTV quoted Xi as saying in the meeting.\nPrabowo's decision to visit China ahead of&nbsp;Indonesia's neighbours in the region underlines the close partnership built up in the past decade under Jokowi, when China became&nbsp;Indonesia's top trading partner, supplying natural resources including nickel and coal.&nbsp;\nJokowi's first visit after his inauguration was to China, for an annual summit of Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) leaders in 2014. That was followed by six more visits.\nChina has also ploughed billions into&nbsp;Indonesian infrastructure and industrial projects, including the Jakarta-Bandung high-speed railway.&nbsp;\nXi hailed the rail initiative as \"a golden sign of high-quality cooperation between the two countries\", according to CCTV.\nIt remains to be seen how Prabowo, now&nbsp;Indonesia's defence minister, will navigate issues including the jostling for influence between China and the United States in Southeast Asia.&nbsp;\nPrabowo has previously said&nbsp;Indonesia&nbsp;was committed to its policy of non-alignment and would keep good ties with both China and the United States.&nbsp;\nChina's expansive claims in the South China Sea may present a test for his leadership, although the two countries' overlapping claims there have not become a vociferous dispute as has unfolded in recent months between China and the Philippines.&nbsp;\nIndonesia&nbsp;says the southern end of the South China Sea is part of its exclusive economic zone. China says the area is within its own territorial claim, marked by a U-shaped \"nine-dash line\" rejected by other regional states.\nChina is willing to continue to deepen maritime cooperation with&nbsp;Indonesia, Xi told Prabowo on Monday.\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nRelated Articles\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nReengineering culture to sustain Prabowo\u2019s leadership\nFocus on revenue reform\nPutin\u2019s India visit aims to shape global multipolarity\nVietnam to build $67 billion high-speed railway\nRelated Article\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nReengineering culture to sustain Prabowo\u2019s leadership\nFocus on revenue reform\nPutin\u2019s India visit aims to shape global multipolarity\nVietnam to build $67 billion high-speed railway\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nMore in World\nView more\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia commences evacuation of 37 citizens in Damascus\nMiddle East and Africa\nAirline pilots, crews voice concerns about Middle East routes\nAmericas\nLula 'stable' after emergency surgery\nHighlight\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEditorial\nNarrow margin\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nThe Latest\nView more\nEconomy\nRI identifies 29 potential nuclear power plant sites\nEconomy\nChinese authorities are considering a weaker yuan as Trump trade risks loom, sources say\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia commences evacuation of 37 citizens in Damascus\nTech\nUS finalizes $6.1 billion Micron chip-making subsidy\nArchipelago\nTwo foreign visitors killed in tree collapse in Monkey Forest\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEconomy\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources\nRegulations\nBullion bank to launch in first half of next year, Airlangga says",

So, we hope there will be no more change to the cost overrun,\u201d KCIC president director Dwiyana Slamet Riyadi said, as quoted by\nTempo\n, adding that it would not affect the proposed fare previously estimated at around Rp 250,000 to Rp 350,000.\nRead also:\nJakarta-Bandung high-speed train gets bigger govt backing after cost overrun\nThe consortium added that it had been working on options to finance the cost overrun but had yet to decide as the process involved the government in negotiation.\nThe government has asked the management to cut costs as best as it can so that the cost overrun can be kept to a minimum.\n\u201cIt's like\nPak\nLuhut [Coordinating Maritime Affairs and Investment Minister Luhut Pandjaitan] said: The dry towels can be squeezed again.

(Reuters/Jason Lee)\nA\nug. 1, 2022 marked the 95\nth\nanniversary of the founding of the People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA) of China. In 1927, the Communist Party of China created a new type of people\u2019s army, which provided a strong guarantee for the realization of independence and great rejuvenation of China.\nFrom that time on, the PLA has bravely devoted itself to the historical trend of seeking liberation and happiness for the Chinese people, and striving for independence and rejuvenation for China. Over the past 95 years, the PLA has gone through wars and fires, opened up a way through brambles and thorns and made great sacrifices, chalked up one victory after another and established historical feats.\nIn recent years, the PLA of China has upheld \u201cXi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era\u201d, firmly and thoroughly implemented President Xi\u2019s thinking on strengthening the armed forces, marched forward on the strategic arrangement of \u201cThree Steps to Modernize China\u2019s National Defense and Military\u201d, ensured the realization of the Chinese army\u2019s centennial goal, enhanced the political loyalty of its armed forces, strengthened them via reform and technology and the training of competent personnel and run them in accordance with the law.\nPLA will take substantial steps on a Chinese path to military development, and comprehensively improve the level of modernizing national defense and the armed forces.&nbsp;China\u2019s military has basically achieved mechanization and has made significant progress in information technology. At any time, the PLA of China has the resolve, the confidence and the ability to defend China\u2019s sovereignty, security and development interests; deter and resist aggression; safeguard national-political security, people\u2019s security and social stability; safeguard legitimate rights and interests, and its overseas interests; and support the sustainable development of the country.\nChinese people love and cherish peace, and take it as their sacred duty to maintain world peace and oppose hegemonism and power politics. For a long time, China remains committed to the path of peaceful development, develops itself by striving for a peaceful international environment and maintains and promotes world peace through its own development in return.\nChina has the world\u2019s best record on peace and security issues. At present, China is still the only country in the world that has incorporated \u201cadhering to the path of peaceful development\u201d into its constitution, and is also the only among the five nuclear-weapons states with nuclear weapons that has promised\nno-first-use of nuclear weapons and unconditional or no threat of nuclear weapons on non-nuclear weapons states and non-nuclear weapon zones.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nAt present, the world is undergoing a historical change in an unprecedented way, posing challenges that must be taken seriously by mankind. Facing this critical moment of world peace and development, President Xi proposed the Global Security Initiative, systematically expounding China's position and proposition on promoting world security and maintaining world peace and security, emphasizing the adherence to a common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable-security vision.\nChina will continue to uphold the banner of peace, development, cooperation and win-win results, pursue an independent foreign policy of peace, adhere to the path of peaceful development, promote the building of a new type of international relations and promote the construction of a community with a shared future for mankind.\nThe PLA has actively participated in international military exchanges and cooperation and in United Nations peacekeeping operations. It has worked with the armed forces of other countries to address global-security challenges, actively fulfilled international responsibilities and obligations and made great contributions to promoting the construction of a community with a shared future for mankind.\nChina and Indonesia are good neighbors, friends and partners. In recent years, with the leadership and support of President Xi and President Joko \u201cJokowi\u201d Widodo, the comprehensive strategic partnership between the two countries has been developing in depth; exchanges and cooperation in various fields are getting closer and have achieved fruitful results, bringing benefits to the two peoples and making contributions to world and regional peace, stability, development and cooperation.\nAt the invitation of Xi, Jokowi paid a successful visit to China in late July, becoming the first foreign head of state that China has received in Beijing since the Beijing Winter Olympics in February of this year, demonstrating the great strategic significance and far-reaching global influence of the relationship between the two countries.\nThe two heads of state agreed to determine the general direction of the China-Indonesia community with a shared future, and committed to forging an exemplary model of major-developing countries seeking mutual benefit, win-win results, common development and South-South cooperation, promoting a series of cooperation outcomes and injecting strong impetus into the development of bilateral relations.\nThe defense and military relationship, as an important part of China-Indonesia relations, has also made new progress. The two armies continuously improve the level of strategic mutual trust. Chinese State Councilor and Minister of National Defense General Wei Fenghe and Indonesian Defense Minister\nPrabowo Subianto\nvisited each other and conducted candid, friendly and fruitful exchanges. Cooperation in military academies and joint exercises have been expanded to multiple fields and levels.\nHumanitarian-relief cooperation has become a highlight of military cooperation between China and Indonesia. Meanwhile, humanitarian-relief cooperation has become the focus and highlight of the relationship between the two armed forces. The leaders of the two militaries extended sympathies and support to each other at difficult times such as the fight against COVID-19 and the tragic sinking of the Indonesian Navy submarine, and took solid and effective measures to help each other.\nAt present, the Chinese government firmly supports Indonesia in hosting the Group of 20 summit later this year and ASEAN meetings next year. All these fully reflect the deep friendship between the two countries and the two armed forces that, as the Indonesian proverb goes,\nBerat sama dipikul, ringan sama&nbsp;dijinjing\n(Share the burden whether heavy or light).\nI am fully confident that with the support and care of their heads of state, the defense departments and armed forces of China and Indonesia will further consolidate and deepen friendly cooperation, add more substance to the China-Indonesia comprehensive strategic partnership and contribute to regional and world peace, stability and development.\n&nbsp;***\nThe writer, a senior colonel, is the defense attach\u00e9 at the Embassy of the People\u2019s Republic of China&nbsp;in Indonesia.\n&nbsp;\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nRelated Articles\nIs Southeast Asia the next frontier for AI?\nTaiwan's Lai kicks off Marshall Islands visit as China fumes\nGovt to review PIK 2\u2019s spatial planning amid land use concerns\nMass casualty attacks in China put focus on mental health as economy slows\nThe visible and the marginalized: Examining our rule of law\nRelated Article\nIs Southeast Asia the next frontier for AI?\nTaiwan's Lai kicks off Marshall Islands visit as China fumes\nGovt to review PIK 2\u2019s spatial planning amid land use concerns\nMass casualty attacks in China put focus on mental health as economy slows\nThe visible and the marginalized: Examining our rule of law\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nMore in Opinion\nView more\nAcademia\nThe bottom-up wave of democratic rejuvenation\nAcademia\nPolice brutality: Fundamental problems in the institution\nAcademia\nFree trade deals increase Indonesian imports more than exports\nHighlight\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEditorial\nNarrow margin\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nThe Latest\nView more\nEconomy\nRI identifies 29 potential nuclear power plant sites\nEconomy\nChinese authorities are considering a weaker yuan as Trump trade risks loom, sources say\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia commences evacuation of 37 citizens in Damascus\nTech\nUS finalizes $6.1 billion Micron chip-making subsidy\nArchipelago\nTwo foreign visitors killed in tree collapse in Monkey Forest\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEconomy\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources\nRegulations\nBullion bank to launch in first half of next year, Airlangga says",

(AFP)\nAt the invitation of Indonesian President Joko \u201cJokowi\u201d Widodo, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang will pay an official visit to Indonesia from May 6 to 8. Indonesia will be the first stop of the first overseas trip by the Chinese premier since the new Chinese government was formed in March 2018. It fully demonstrates the great significance China places on its relationship with Indonesia.\nBoth China and Indonesia are ancient civilizations with a splendid history. The history of friendly exchanges between the two peoples can be traced back to the Han dynasty more than 2,000 years ago.\nThe great Chinese navigator Zheng He from the Ming Dynasty made seven voyages to the \u201cWestern Seas\u201d, leaving behind countless legacies in Java and Sumatra. Indonesia was one of the first countries to establish diplomatic relations with the new China.\nIn the 1950s, both countries stood together with other countries in Asia and Africa to advocate the Bandung Spirit, featuring peaceful coexistence and seeking common ground while reserving differences. Today, it remains an important guideline for state-to-state relations. Since its inception 68 years ago, the China-Indonesia relationship has seen its fair share of ups and downs and developed by leaps and bounds. The resumption of diplomatic ties in 1990 started a new chapter in the development of bilateral relations. To build even stronger relations has become the shared commitment and resolve of both governments and societies.\nViewing Indonesia as a priority in China\u2019s neighborhood diplomacy, President Xi Jinping and the Chinese government have attached great importance to the development of China-Indonesia relations over the past five years. As of today, President Xi has paid two visits to Indonesia. During his state visit to Indonesia in 2013, President Xi unveiled the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road Initiative, and elevated the bilateral relationship to a comprehensive strategic partnership. In 2015, President Xi once again visited Indonesia to attend the Asian-African Summit and commemoration of the 60th anniversary of the Bandung Conference. The two sides have jointly promoted and enhanced the Asian-African spirit of solidarity and cooperation.\nChina and Indonesia are good neighbors, good friends and good partners. The broad common interests and deep-rooted friendship serve as a tight linkage between the two countries. In recent years, under the leadership of President Xi and President Jokowi, China and Indonesia have focused on promoting synergy between respective development strategies and expanded cooperation across the board. The bilateral relations have embarked on a fast track of development. President Jokowi has paid five visits to China and held six bilateral meetings with President Xi. The two heads of state have reached an important consensus on enhancing their comprehensive strategic partnership. China has remained Indonesia\u2019s largest trading partner for seven consecutive years. In 2017, bilateral trade registered a year-on-year increase of 18.3 percent to exceed US$63.3 billion. Indonesia\u2019s exports to China increased by 33 percent, promoting a balanced development of bilateral trade. Meanwhile, China\u2019s annual investment in Indonesia increased by over 30 percent to reach $3.4 billion. Major cooperation projects, including the Jakarta-Bandung high-speed railway project, are in full swing. In 2017, the number of Chinese tourists to Indonesia surpassed 2 million for the first time, totaling 2.06 million, which made China the largest source of overseas tourists to Indonesia. Having received over 14,000 Indonesian students, China has become Indonesia\u2019s second-largest destination for overseas studies. Chinese giant pandas Cai Tao and Hu Chun made their home in Indonesia, bringing a message of friendship and goodwill from the Chinese people.\nToday, we live in a time in which there is an overwhelming trend toward peace and cooperation, openness and connectivity, and reform and innovation. The 19th CPC National Congress held last October ushered socialism with Chinese characteristics into a new era. It marks a new chapter in China\u2019s rejuvenation and its effort for shared prosperity with the rest of the world. In this new era, China will stay committed to advancing reform in all respects, follow the new development vision, implement the strategy of opening up for win-win results and stick to the path of peaceful development. By doing so, we will be able to build a new type of international relations, and a community with a shared future for mankind.\nThe year 2018 marks the 40th anniversary of China\u2019s reform and opening up. What has happened proves that opening up was key to China\u2019s economic growth over the past 40 years and in the same vein, high-quality development of China\u2019s economy in the future can only be achieved with greater openness. A more open and prosperous China not only benefits its people but also provides new opportunities for countries in the region and beyond, including Indonesia. I believe the opportunities are as follows:\nFirst is market opportunity. Despite the lack of effective global demand, the potential of the Chinese market is still growing. China does not seek a trade surplus; it has a genuine desire to increase imports. It is estimated that China will import $10 trillion in goods in the coming five years. This November, China will host the first China International Import Expo. We cordially invite the Indonesian business community to participate and promote Indonesian products.\nPremier Li Keqiang (right) meets with President Joko Widodo. (XIE Huanchi, Xinhua News Agency)\nSecond is investment opportunity. In this new round of reform, China encourages businesses and individuals to invest abroad. Chinese businesses are becoming a major source of international investment and financing. China\u2019s outbound investment is estimated to reach $750 billion in the next five years. With a continuously improving business environment, Indonesia is becoming a major destination for Chinese investment.\nThird is people-to-people exchange opportunity. The number of Chinese outbound tourists is expected to reach 700 million in the coming five years. Indonesia in recent years has attracted a growing number of tourists from China. Tourist resorts such as Bali, Manado and Yogyakarta have become increasingly popular among Chinese tourists. I believe this growing trend will not only help enhance mutual understanding between the two countries, but also boost the local economy. Moreover, China will provide more varieties of scholarships to help Indonesian students to realize their dream of studying in China.\nFourth is growth opportunity. The world today needs a developing China more than ever. Over the past five years, in the face of sluggish world economic recovery, the Chinese economy has registered an average growth rate of 7.1 percent. Contributing over 30 percent of global growth, China has become a key anchor and driver for the world economy. In this new era, China will stay committed to reform and opening up, promote high-quality development of its economy, and continue to contribute to the economic development of all countries around the world, including Indonesia.\nDuring the official visit, Premier Li will hold bilateral meetings with President Jokowi and other Indonesian leaders to exchange views on further promoting synergy between development strategies and expand practical cooperation. The visit will chart the future direction of China-Indonesia relations in this new era. The leaders will also witness the signing of multiple cooperation agreements in the sectors of strategic alignment, e-commerce and agriculture, injecting new impetus to the bilateral friendly cooperation.\nUnity gives us strength and good solid work will shape our future. This year marks the fifth anniversary of the China-Indonesia Comprehensive Strategic Partnership. I believe the two countries will draw on the momentum generated by the upcoming visit by Premier Li and make concerted efforts to implement the important consensus reached between the leaders, further synergize development strategies, push forward construction of major projects, including the Jakarta-Bandung high-speed railway, kick-start cooperation on the Regional Comprehensive Economic Corridors, and elevate bilateral practical cooperation to new heights. Let us play music of the gamelan in celebration of our comprehensive strategic cooperation!\n&nbsp;\nJP/Ben Latuihamallo\n___________________________\nThe writer is the ambassador of the People\u2019s Republic of China to Indonesia.\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nRelated Articles\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nFree trade deals increase Indonesian imports more than exports\nIndonesia\u2019s tourist sector: A new era of innovation and growth\nPresident Prabowo should make Indonesia a global champion of democracy\nNew mosque in Nusantara to replace Istiqlal as state mosque\nRelated Article\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nFree trade deals increase Indonesian imports more than exports\nIndonesia\u2019s tourist sector: A new era of innovation and growth\nPresident Prabowo should make Indonesia a global champion of democracy\nNew mosque in Nusantara to replace Istiqlal as state mosque\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nMore in News\nView more\nOpinion\nAnalysis: Govt adopts mandatory B35 biodiesel program as CPO prices tumble\nBusiness\nGlobal chip crunch stunts Indonesia car sales recovery\nBusiness\nXL profit falls in Q3 as tower sale income dries\nHighlight\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEditorial\nNarrow margin\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nThe Latest\nView more\nEconomy\nRI identifies 29 potential nuclear power plant sites\nEconomy\nChinese authorities are considering a weaker yuan as Trump trade risks loom, sources say\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia commences evacuation of 37 citizens in Damascus\nTech\nUS finalizes $6.1 billion Micron chip-making subsidy\nArchipelago\nTwo foreign visitors killed in tree collapse in Monkey Forest\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEconomy\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources\nRegulations\nBullion bank to launch in first half of next year, Airlangga says",

We are not building villas, we are building a vision,\u201d he says.\nThe company\u2019s approach to integrative Wellness encompasses physical, mental and spiritual health, offering advanced amenities such as ultramodern saunas and OKEARA structured hydrogen water, known for its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, along with a range of other benefits. These form part of the highly personalized programs that enable optimized lifestyles through education and support.\nInvestment in Nature is vital to ELEMENTIS, as demonstrated by its modern architectural designs that maximize ecological immersion and minimize environmental impact without compromising on comfort.\n\u201cWe offer abundant opportunities for outdoor recreation and exploration, harmonizing our lifestyles with the natural world,\u201d says Titov.\nELEMENTIS has a profound commitment to Community building as integral to its business ethos. Beyond being a hospitality brand, it strives to unite like-minded individuals who embrace innovation and comprehensive holistic wellness.\n\u201cWe aim to cultivate a thriving Community that fosters the ongoing development of Elementis and helps us realize our vision,\u201d Titov says.\nInnovation is the company\u2019s cornerstone, driving its team to enhance the Elementis experience through collaboration with leading experts while fostering creativity and prioritizing a forward-thinking mindset.\n\u201cBy utilizing next-generation technology and energy-efficient solutions, the company is leading the way in industry trends and advancements,\u201d says chief hospitality officer Michael Burchett, a veteran hospitality professional with over 45 years in the global industry.\nAmong the company\u2019s founding partners is Singapore-based Sun-Ice Energy, inventor of the world\u2019s first zero carbon climate control system. All ELEMENTIS structures that require cooling utilizes Sun-Ice Energy\u2019s technology, while all resorts and residences feature special insulated glass and construction techniques to optimize energy efficiency and ensure a healthy living environment.\nComplementing Sun-Ice Energy\u2019s world-first climate-responsive technology, all ELEMENTIS resorts and residences are constructed from responsibly sourced glue laminated timber.\nAlso known as glulam, this engineered wood product is made by bonding thin layers of timber with eco-friendly, durable glue that is also moisture and pest resistant. Compared to other building materials such as cement and steel, glulam\u2019s manufacturing process consumes less energy and produces fewer greenhouse gas emissions.\nGlulam will be exclusively supplied locally by Woodlam Indonesia, the nation\u2019s first end-to-end wood consultants. For its engineered timber, Woodlam Indonesia uses the wood of the jabon tree (\nNeolamarckia cadamba\n), a native tropical evergreen. The company adheres to stringent international regulations that ensure legal and sustainable logging practices.\nWorking alongside Woodlam Indonesia, Italian building materials supplier Rothoblaas will leverage its latest technologies in connections, waterproofing and safety to enhance the guest experience at Elementis properties, playing a crucial role in the precise integration and connection of glulam components for superior quality and performance.\n\"Our commitment to sustainable construction and climate-responsive solutions stands at the forefront,\u201d says Titov.\n\u201cAt ELEMENTIS, we are not just building properties. We are shaping a vision of a holistic lifestyle that is deeply connected to the environment and those around us. We want to inspire a new paradigm where innovation harmonizes with nature, fostering communities that thrive on wellness and shared values.\"\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nRelated Articles\nAPRIL Group underlines commitment to sustainable production, forest management at COP29\nFrom root to leaf, Kubu shows the true meaning behind sustainable culinary feasts\nASEAN must protect Southeast Asian people\u2019s right to food\nDeveloping mangrove-friendly products bolsters sustainable mangrove ecosystem\nEmbracing the world at a slower pace\nRelated Article\nAPRIL Group underlines commitment to sustainable production, forest management at COP29\nFrom root to leaf, Kubu shows the true meaning behind sustainable culinary feasts\nASEAN must protect Southeast Asian people\u2019s right to food\nDeveloping mangrove-friendly products bolsters sustainable mangrove ecosystem\nEmbracing the world at a slower pace\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nMore in Front row\nView more\nFront Row\nBAZNAS achieves top public service rating from Ombudsman RI\nFront Row\nBNPT, PNM strengthen collaboration to combat radicalism through economic empowerment\nFront Row\nBAZNAS distributes Dam Haj meat to Indonesian residents in four regions of Saudi Arabia\nHighlight\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEditorial\nNarrow margin\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nThe Latest\nView more\nTech\nUS finalizes $6.1 billion Micron chip-making subsidy\nArchipelago\nTwo foreign visitors killed in tree collapse in Monkey Forest\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEconomy\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources\nRegulations\nBullion bank to launch in first half of next year, Airlangga says\nMiddle East and Africa\nAirline pilots, crews voice concerns about Middle East routes\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nRegulations\nEY worker's death spotlights India's unprotected white-collar labor",

Most railway investments come with [a BEP] of more than 20 years,\u201d Dwiyana explained.\nThe worsening economics surrounding the Jakarta-Bandung HSR only add to a list of issues pointing to an increasingly bleak future for the project.\nThe government announced last year that the project had exceeded its initial budget of US$6.07 billion by $2 billion. This prompted the issuance of a new regulation to allow for government funding and guarantees, which had been initially ruled out.\nThe government has injected Rp 4.3 trillion ($299 million) from the state budget through state-owned railway company PT KAI, funds that KCIC said it had used for overdue payments. More capital injections are needed to solve the cost overrun, but are pending an audit from the Development Finance Comptroller.\nIn January, President Joko Widodo announced that the operational date of the Jakarta-Bandung HSR had been pushed back six months to June 2023. KCIC later revealed that the delay was due to the project running into additional technical and geological difficulties.\nMeanwhile, KCIC said it had completed 10 of 13 tunnels, and that it planned to complete the remaining three by April.\nThese three tunnels are considered to be among the most difficult ones in the project and have been delayed for more than half a year.\nOther obstacles include the COVID-19 pandemic, with the project reporting almost 500 workers with the disease and another 1,500 in self-isolation.\nSyarif Abdullah Alkadrie, the deputy chairman of House Commission V overseeing infrastructure and transportation, questioned the fate of the project in light of the Nusantara capital city (IKN) development project, suggesting that the Jakarta-Bandung HSR could end up with zero passengers.\nHe pointed to other projects that had met a similar fate due to \u201cmisplanning\u201d, like Kertajati International Airport in West Java and the light rapid transit (LRT) in Palembang.\n\u201cWhich is better, stopping or continuing [the project]? I'm worried that it will create more burdens [on the state budget],\u201d said Syarif, who is from the NasDem faction.\nRail Transportation Director General Zulfikri told the same meeting that the Transportation Ministry would wait until KCIC submitted the updated feasibility study to determine any measures needed to support the project.\n\u201cWe will look at the assumptions used later, like the cost overrun, development delays and the pandemic. We are waiting and will see. If it is necessary, we will also amend the concession period,\u201d Zulfikri said.\nHe added that the current concession period was 50 years from the issuance of the operational permit.\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nRelated Articles\nOvertourism or balanced development?

(Antara/Jessica Wuysang)\nW\norld Social Work Day (WSWD) is celebrated every year on the third Tuesday of March. It has become a high point in the social work calendar, with social workers worldwide, including in Indonesia, celebrating and promoting the profession's contributions to individuals, families, communities, and wider society.\nThis year\u2019s theme, \"\nBuen Vivir\n: Shared Future for Transformative Change\", highlights the importance of social workers embracing community-led approaches grounded in indigenous wisdom and harmonious coexistence with nature for social transformation.\nThe concept of\nBuen Vivir\n, a Spanish word for \u201cgood living\u201d or \u201cliving well,\u201d originated from South American philosophy and has even been inscribed in the constitutions of Ecuador and Bolivia.&nbsp;It incorporates ideas of de-growth, austerity, and a stern critique of extractivism, which invokes limits in development. The idea emphasizes that humans are never owners of the earth and its resources, only stewards. Within the framework, those other futures we want must be well kept in check.\nSocial workers are important human resources in development. The distinguishing characteristic of social workers from other professions is their emphasis on the person-in-environment model and social justice.\nSocial justice is an integral part of social work and is strongly embedded in its value of equality. Including struggles for environmental justice within an environmental framework is a critical and significant part of social workers\u2019 activities. It surfaces when redressing complex environmental degradation issues, vulnerability among marginalized populations, and disaster responses.\nThe Golden Indonesia 2045 Vision envisions Indonesia becoming a high-income country, the world's fourth or fifth largest economy by 2045, with near-zero poverty. The goal is set for 2045 since the republic will commemorate 100 years of its independence by then. Meanwhile, inequality is and will likely remain a key challenge threatening Indonesia\u2019s future growth and prosperity.&nbsp;\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nInequality threatens long-term social and economic development, harms poverty reduction, and destroys people\u2019s fulfillment and self-worth. Sustainable development cannot be achieved if individuals and communities are excluded from better access and contribution to social, economic, and political life. Therefore, reducing inequalities and ensuring no one is left behind are key to achieving all 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nRelated Articles\nThe rise of Islamic environmentalism and neoliberalism\nMoving up social workers with the \u2018Buen Vivir\u2019 wisdom&nbsp;\nHappy birthday, Pancasila; from Germany\nPreventing stadium tragedy through policy improvement\nOutlook darkens for Wall Street as Biden's regulators take shape\nRelated Article\nThe rise of Islamic environmentalism and neoliberalism\nMoving up social workers with the \u2018Buen Vivir\u2019 wisdom&nbsp;\nHappy birthday, Pancasila; from Germany\nPreventing stadium tragedy through policy improvement\nOutlook darkens for Wall Street as Biden's regulators take shape\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nMore in Opinion\nView more\nAcademia\nThe bottom-up wave of democratic rejuvenation\nAcademia\nPolice brutality: Fundamental problems in the institution\nAcademia\nFree trade deals increase Indonesian imports more than exports\nHighlight\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEditorial\nNarrow margin\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nThe Latest\nView more\nEconomy\nRI identifies 29 potential nuclear power plant sites\nEconomy\nChinese authorities are considering a weaker yuan as Trump trade risks loom, sources say\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia commences evacuation of 37 citizens in Damascus\nTech\nUS finalizes $6.1 billion Micron chip-making subsidy\nArchipelago\nTwo foreign visitors killed in tree collapse in Monkey Forest\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEconomy\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources\nRegulations\nBullion bank to launch in first half of next year, Airlangga says",

(AP/Mark Baker)\nS\nspan style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\"&gt;Sharing the same state religion, a docile way of living, and geographical links have all helped in maintaining a good relationship between Laos and Cambodia throughout their modern histories.\nA Cambodian diplomat and cultural expert commented as such when delivering a lecture in Vientiane on Tuesday ahead of marking the 60th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries on June 15.\nIn his opening remark Cambodian Ambassador to Laos Hos Sereythonh reminded everyone of the historical relations between the two nations in the era of King Fa Ngum, who grew up in a Khmer king's custody eventually becoming a son-in-law who united the region through the introduction of Buddhism and the creation of the kingdom of Lane Xang.\nThe Lao Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Institute of Foreign Affairs, Asia-Pacific and Africa Department, and the Cambodian Embassy in Laos jointly organized the lecture, with the Vice President of the Royal Academy of Cambodia and Director General of the International Institute of Cambodia, Sok Touch invited to deliver a lecture entitled: \u201cSixty Years of Cambodian-Lao Diplomatic Relations: Achievements and Ways Forward\u201d.\nSok said, \u201cEven though 1956 was regarded as the beginning of diplomatic relations between the two countries, the relations between our nations and people have started nearly a thousand year ago\u201d.\n\u201cThese relations are based in the legacy of our ancestors and previous leaders of our two nations\u201d, he added.\nSok also pointed to Buddhism, which the two countries share as a state religion, as a long-standing cultural bond.\n\u201cThe same traditions attached to the compassion and peaceful minded consciousness taught through Buddhism make the people of our two nations eternally brothers and sisters\u201d, he said.\nHe shared his fascination with Buddhism in Laos suggesting that he wouldn't mind being ordained after he finished his diplomatic mission in Laos.\nHe also spoke to the years of Democratic Kampuchea rule in the late 1970s when the relations between the two countries were deteriorating, having been restored to close relations after the collapse of Khmer Rouge on Jan. 7, 1979.\nSok noted the two countries have also shared similar difficulties like the economic embargos by some of the world's super-powers during the Cold War.\nHe highlighted the bilateral relations between the two nations, which he said had been strengthened and expanded steadily in the recent years through exchange of frequent state visits between top leaders of Cambodia and Laos.\nHe remarked on both countries political cooperation, saying they supported each other both materially and spiritually and at regional and global levels.\nHe ended by saying Cambodia was highly appreciative of Laos' important contributions to their peace process over the past decade, while Laos was also appreciative of Cambodia's contribution to its national re-construction and defense, as leaders of both governments have also frequently mentioned.\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali,

(AFP/Kazuhiro Nogi)\nT\nhose who have watched\nThe Big Short\n, a comedy-drama film about the crash of the United States market in 2008, may be rather skeptical, or frightened by financial derivatives. The movie presented&nbsp;the innovative credit default swaps (CDSs) and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) that became the seeds of the US financial market turmoil.\nThe takeaway of the movie was that the haphazardly crafted financial derivatives instruments ended up&nbsp;endangering the whole system. Many scholars have similarly voiced post-2008 crisis precautions about the derivatives market regulations.\nThe late Prof. Lynn Stout of Cornell University argued that changes to the law had caused the market to crash. Stout identified a series of dynamics that removed legal constraints on speculative trading in over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives. The dynamics hence provided leeway for private actors to privately arrange OTC trading, which then became a catalyst for the capitalism&nbsp;beast of speculation.\nThe mixed feelings about derivatives are part of an overdue discourse. Derivatives are so lucrative they can engender Keynesian animal-spirited whims of the capitalist wallet, but the 2008 experience highlighted contusion in the derivatives. Despite this, derivatives have still proven useful for hedging (not speculations).\nJohn Finnerty of Fordham University has acknowledged the proper use of derivatives for improving economic efficiency and managing unwanted risk exposure. J.M. Keynes himself recognized that the market could provide benefits to societies that help facilitate investment, despite his seminal warning of \u201cliquidity illusion\u201d (that no such thing as market liquidity for everyone).\nFor emerging markets like Indonesia, derivatives market development is important. When the onshore derivatives market gets more lucrative, market participants will more actively hedge their financial position, thereby developing more efficient risk management and&nbsp;providing a&nbsp;space for market expansions. The derivatives market bestows liquidity, which opens alternative funding sources. By the same token, the domestic derivatives market could contribute to&nbsp;efficient price discovery.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nSome market participants might use derivatives for leverage, sometimes with speculative motives, i.e&nbsp;betting.

Walimi in West Java was another critical spot for the project because the developer had to construct three tunnels with a total length of 7.44 kilometers.\nWika corporate secretary Puspita Anggraeni said the project had been divided into 115 development points, 32 of which were elevated projects, including bridges in Bekasi, West Java.\nPuspita said 42 points were under construction, including seven tunnels and a train depot in Tegalluar, Bandung.\nShe added that another 41 points were being prepared for the next construction phase.\nThe high speed train is designed to travel at a speed of 350 km per hour, about a 45-minute trip from Jakarta to Bandung.&nbsp; The developer aims to complete construction of the entire project by June 2021, a two-year delay from its original plan.

MH Thamrin and Jl. Sudirman (good access, security, cleanliness, adequate and safe parking, etc.), I am sure property owners and investors would rush to develop their properties.\nMaybe the management of the area should be put in contact with the property management company that manages urban developments such as the Sudirman Central Business District, the Taman Rasuna super block, or private/ community institutions, without the intervention of agencies that today run Kota Tua.\nIt works in Kuta, Bali and in New York, the US.\nTiua\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nRelated Article\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nFree trade deals increase Indonesian imports more than exports\nIndonesia\u2019s tourist sector: A new era of innovation and growth\nPresident Prabowo should make Indonesia a global champion of democracy\nNew mosque in Nusantara to replace Istiqlal as state mosque\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nMore in News\nView more\nOpinion\nAnalysis: Govt adopts mandatory B35 biodiesel program as CPO prices tumble\nBusiness\nGlobal chip crunch stunts Indonesia car sales recovery\nBusiness\nXL profit falls in Q3 as tower sale income dries\nHighlight\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEditorial\nNarrow margin\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nThe Latest\nView more\nEconomy\nRI identifies 29 potential nuclear power plant sites\nEconomy\nChinese authorities are considering a weaker yuan as Trump trade risks loom, sources say\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia commences evacuation of 37 citizens in Damascus\nTech\nUS finalizes $6.1 billion Micron chip-making subsidy\nArchipelago\nTwo foreign visitors killed in tree collapse in Monkey Forest\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEconomy\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources\nRegulations\nBullion bank to launch in first half of next year, Airlangga says",

Moeldoko\n-\nJP/Ricky Yudhistira\nMarch 17, Online\nIndonesian Military (TNI) commander Gen. Moeldoko said on Tuesday that the government had discussed security matters relating to the government'\u0080\u0099s plan to enact a visa-free policy for 30 countries to ensure that no security problems would arise.\nIn its efforts to bolster the weakening rupiah, the government recently announced that it would waive visa requirements for 30 countries as early as next month to boost tourism in order to net more foreign exchange income.\nYour comments:\nIt'\u0080\u0099s getting funny to see the TNI trying to sneak its nose in or throw its rather unnecessary statements around on everything that'\u0080\u0099s happening in this country lately.\nThey are kind of missing those good old days when they were relevant in the government.\nItsbad\nOf course there will not be any security threats now since the visa on arrival was given for a fee without any background check on the arriving tourist. So, in this respect, it stays exactly the same.\nDevineasia\nThere will, of course, still be a time limit for this visa, which when overstayed will open that person up to the same visa violations that exist. The only difference is tourists will save US$35 and perhaps feel a little more welcome when they arrive.\nMy biggest gripe about arriving in Indonesia is they never have any bloody pens to fill out your immigration cards with, and I often have to wander around until I can find someone to borrow one off. How much does maintaining a few pens on chains cost?\nLoro Blonyo\nThey have been ripping us off for years by charging for visas in US dollars and when they convert it to rupiah the exchange rate is nothing more than appalling. Where is Indonesia'\u0080\u0099s pride?

Northern Australia can breed and grow cattle at a lower cost compared to livestock farmers in Indonesia, while Indonesian feedlots can fatten Australian cattle at a lower cost than in Northern Australia. Indonesia can also slaughter Northern Australian cattle at a much lower cost than in Australia.\nWhen Australian cattle are slaughtered in Indonesia, the entire animal is used for productive purposes '\u0080\u0094 for example, skin for leather (Bandung '\u0080\u0094 shoes), provides significant '\u0080\u009cadded value'\u0080\u009d and employment to Indonesia. Indonesia'\u0080\u0099s Agriculture Ministry'\u0080\u0099s policy of '\u0080\u009cself-sufficiency'\u0080\u009d, with its quota system, has only led to '\u0080\u009crent seeking'\u0080\u0099, as we have seen recently.\nAn Indonesian policy based on the principles of '\u0080\u009cfood security'\u0080\u009d would be more appropriate. This would involve the import of livestock/beef from Australia while seeking to make Indonesian domestic producers more competitive. The problem, as always, is to find the right balance between the interests of Indonesian producers and consumers.\nAccording to an article published in The Jakarta Post on July 20, the Indonesian Trade Ministry said that '\u0080\u009cIndonesia will remove import quotas for beef and live cattle to stabilize domestic prices and curb inflation'\u0080\u009d. The proposed scheme, where parity or '\u0080\u009cnormal'\u0080\u009d prices are used to assess the need for imports, makes more sense than the quota system applied by the Agriculture Ministry.\nSuch a scheme is more in line with the concept of food security, as advocated by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and would probably be more acceptable to trading partners in the World Trade Organization.\nUnfortunately, much damage has already been done to Indonesian-Australian livestock trade, to the detriment of both Australian and Indonesian producers, as well as consumers. Irrespective of which party wins the next election in Australia (September 2013), the Australian government will likely restrict live cattle trade to Indonesia until more humane slaughter practices are in place.\nAll parties should be aware that the concept of halal slaughter is not limited to the method of slaughter alone, but more generally to the humane treatment of animals, as advocated by Prophet Muhammad (Hadiths). Australian abattoirs adhere to these halal practices '\u0080\u0093 Indonesia should adopt them also.\nThe bottom line is that Australia and Indonesia need to establish reliable, long-term relations in beef trade that respect the interests of both countries. My concern is that, if the Australian and Indonesia governments do not focus on '\u0080\u009creliable, long-term trade relations'\u0080\u009d in this sector, the Australian beef industry will establish longer-term trade relations with other more reliable trading partners in the Asian region.

He denies the charges.\nNevertheless, Bashir received a warm greeting from Xi, who told him he \"welcomes Sudan's participation in the Belt and Road\" and \"opposes foreign interference in Sudan's internal affairs\", the official Xinhua news service reported Sunday.\nChina has provided aid to Africa since the Cold War, but Beijing's presence in the region has grown exponentially with its emergence as a global trading power.\nChinese state-owned companies have aggressively pursued large investments in Africa, whose vast resources have helped fuel China's transformation into an economic powerhouse.\nWhile relations between China and African nations are broadly positive, concerns have intensified about the impact of some of China's deals in the region.\nDjibouti has become heavily dependent on Chinese financing after China opened its first overseas military base in the Horn of Africa country last year, a powerful signal of the continent's strategic importance to Beijing.\nLocals in other countries have complained about the practice of using Chinese labour for building projects and what are perceived as sweetheart deals for Chinese companies.\nThe concerns are likely to grow as countries in other parts of the world -- especially Southeast Asia -- begin to question whether Chinese aid comes at too high a price, prompting Malaysia, for instance, to cancel a $20-billion rail project last month.\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nRelated Articles\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources\nChina lifts final bans on Australian red meat as trade row nears end\nSilk Road of Art: Chinese cultural treasures from Shanghai to Jakarta\nIndonesia-Africa Forum: RI hopes for deals on energy, health\nTeam denies Prabowo's recent speech critical of Jokowi\nRelated Article\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources\nChina lifts final bans on Australian red meat as trade row nears end\nSilk Road of Art: Chinese cultural treasures from Shanghai to Jakarta\nIndonesia-Africa Forum: RI hopes for deals on energy, health\nTeam denies Prabowo's recent speech critical of Jokowi\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nMore in News\nView more\nOpinion\nAnalysis: Govt adopts mandatory B35 biodiesel program as CPO prices tumble\nBusiness\nGlobal chip crunch stunts Indonesia car sales recovery\nBusiness\nXL profit falls in Q3 as tower sale income dries\nHighlight\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEditorial\nNarrow margin\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nThe Latest\nView more\nPolitics\nGovt to make KPK sole graft-fighting agency\nEconomy\nRI identifies 29 potential nuclear power plant sites\nEconomy\nChinese authorities are considering a weaker yuan as Trump trade risks loom, sources say\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia commences evacuation of 37 citizens in Damascus\nTech\nUS finalizes $6.1 billion Micron chip-making subsidy\nArchipelago\nTwo foreign visitors killed in tree collapse in Monkey Forest\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEconomy\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources",

But he foreshadowed a \"brutal, bloody couple of weeks\" since Russian leader Vladimir Putin had \"everything at stake now [and] it's hard to see an elegant, or inelegant, dismount\".\nThe Kremlin describes its actions as a \"special operation\" to disarm Ukraine and unseat leaders it calls neo-Nazis. Ukraine and Western allies call this a baseless pretext for a war of choice that has raised fears of wider conflict in Europe.\n&nbsp;\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nRelated Articles\nChina to curbs exports of key chipmaking components to US\nTaiwan's Lai kicks off Marshall Islands visit as China fumes\nIs Beijing undermining Indonesia\u2019s free and active foreign policy?\nIndonesia\u2019s Delta Dunia to acquire Australian coal mines for $455m\nThe European Union and Prabowo's Indonesia: What\u2019s changed?\nRelated Article\nChina to curbs exports of key chipmaking components to US\nTaiwan's Lai kicks off Marshall Islands visit as China fumes\nIs Beijing undermining Indonesia\u2019s free and active foreign policy?\nIndonesia\u2019s Delta Dunia to acquire Australian coal mines for $455m\nThe European Union and Prabowo's Indonesia: What\u2019s changed?\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nMore in Paper\nView more\nOpinion\nAnalysis: Govt adopts mandatory B35 biodiesel program as CPO prices tumble\nBusiness\nGlobal chip crunch stunts Indonesia car sales recovery\nBusiness\nXL profit falls in Q3 as tower sale income dries\nHighlight\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEditorial\nNarrow margin\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nThe Latest\nView more\nPolitics\nGovt to make KPK sole graft-fighting agency\nEconomy\nRI identifies 29 potential nuclear power plant sites\nEconomy\nChinese authorities are considering a weaker yuan as Trump trade risks loom, sources say\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia commences evacuation of 37 citizens in Damascus\nTech\nUS finalizes $6.1 billion Micron chip-making subsidy\nArchipelago\nTwo foreign visitors killed in tree collapse in Monkey Forest\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEconomy\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources",

The armed conflict has intensified since the military coup started three years ago on Feb. 1, 2021. (AFP)\nT\nhree years after Myanmar\u2019s military seized power from a democratically elected government, the armed conflict in the country might appear intractable.\nThe consequences have indeed been horrific: Tens of thousands of pro-democracy advocates have been killed, imprisoned or forced to flee their homeland. Villages have been decimated by the military\u2019s aerial assaults on civilian populations. Escalating violence has fueled a humanitarian disaster, with over two and a half million people displaced and one in three in need of assistance, with the highest poverty rate in 15 years.\nIt would be a grave mistake \u2013 and a missed opportunity \u2013 for the international community to dismiss the Myanmar crisis as too difficult to resolve. The post-coup period has demonstrated that people in Myanmar will neither give in to fear or repression nor give up their struggle to freely choose their political leaders.\nThe regime\u2019s divide and conquer tactics have failed.\nThose striving for democracy are stronger than ever. Anti-regime groups in different parts of the country have mounted, to date, the fiercest armed resistance to military rule. These developments have sharpened the choice for the regime: either risk more political and territorial losses or pursue an inclusive dialogue with all parties.\nTo pressure the military regime toward the path of peace and democracy, the United States has rolled out a series of targeted financial sanctions.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nLast June, we imposed sanctions against the regime-controlled Myanmar Foreign Trade Bank and Myanmar Investment Commercial Bank, a move that undercut the military\u2019s ability to obtain foreign currency and purchase weapons from abroad.\nIn October, the US sanctioned the Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprise, the regime\u2019s most lucrative state-owned company, curtailing a key source of US dollar revenues.\nThe US Congress did its part by passing the Myanmar Act, which supports additional steps to promote accountability for the regime\u2019s abuses.\nThese actions, along with those of our European and Asian allies, have disrupted the Myanmar military\u2019s ability to carry out atrocities and provided a powerful incentive for its leaders to change course.\nAt the same time, we are supporting the diverse coalition of ethnic, religious and political leaders working to build a federal democracy in Myanmar. The US has provided nearly US$400 million to help pro-democracy entities improve their governance capacity, develop local health and education policies, and refine plans for a political transition to civilian governance.\nIn my conversations with the pro-democracy National Unity Government and other actors in the opposition movement, it is clear they have come a long way toward agreeing on a shared vision for the future.\nSince the coup, the US has provided over $317 million in lifesaving assistance to people across Myanmar, through both international organizations and local partners. Our assistance has repaired hospitals and homes, evacuated injured civilians from conflict zones, supplied medicine and clean water, and fed children suffering from malnourishment.\nMuch of this assistance has reached those in ethnic areas along Myanmar\u2019s borders, including those affected by the military\u2019s ethnic cleansing against the Rohingya minority.\nMore must be done, and we urge the international community to press Myanmar\u2019s military regime to allow unhindered access by humanitarian actors and build pathways across borders, so aid flows to those who need it most.\nLooking forward, we will continue to urge partners in the Indo-Pacific, particularly those in ASEAN, to redouble their efforts for a transition to an inclusive democracy and make progress on the ASEAN Five Point Consensus.\nWe will continue to encourage the United Nations Security Council, which adopted its first-ever resolution on the situation in Myanmar in December 2022, to use all tools at its disposal to support ASEAN\u2019s efforts. This is what the people of Myanmar deserve, and it matters to the future of the entire region.\nThe destabilizing impact of the military regime has long been felt in Myanmar, but the consequences are increasingly affecting the broader region and the world. Conflict has turned Myanmar into the world\u2019s largest opium producer, a hub of cyber scamming that uses forced labor to steal billions of dollars from foreign citizens and a driver of irregular migration flows that put migrants at risk.\nDespite the tragic events that unfold every day in Myanmar, we still envision a better future. We will still pursue an inclusive, democratically elected civilian government capable of delivering economic growth and promoting equality and justice under the law.\nWorking alongside our allies and partners, the United States will continue to help realize these possibilities and help fulfill Myanmar\u2019s promise to become an inclusive, prosperous and democratic nation.\n***\nThe writer is the counselor of the United States Department of State.\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nRelated Articles\nPresident Prabowo should make Indonesia a global champion of democracy\nThe fall and rise of American democracy\nVietnam to build $67 billion high-speed railway\n12% VAT: A Fiscal solution or an economic burden on the middle class?\nPinning hopes on Danantara\nRelated Article\nPresident Prabowo should make Indonesia a global champion of democracy\nThe fall and rise of American democracy\nVietnam to build $67 billion high-speed railway\n12% VAT: A Fiscal solution or an economic burden on the middle class?\nPinning hopes on Danantara\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nMore in Opinion\nView more\nAcademia\nThe bottom-up wave of democratic rejuvenation\nAcademia\nPolice brutality: Fundamental problems in the institution\nAcademia\nFree trade deals increase Indonesian imports more than exports\nHighlight\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEditorial\nNarrow margin\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nThe Latest\nView more\nPolitics\nGovt to make KPK sole graft-fighting agency\nEconomy\nRI identifies 29 potential nuclear power plant sites\nEconomy\nChinese authorities are considering a weaker yuan as Trump trade risks loom, sources say\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia commences evacuation of 37 citizens in Damascus\nTech\nUS finalizes $6.1 billion Micron chip-making subsidy\nArchipelago\nTwo foreign visitors killed in tree collapse in Monkey Forest\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEconomy\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources",

The Philippines on the other hand has thrown its weight behind the new plan.\nOn Tuesday, Wang Yi said the AUKUS security pact brought hidden dangers to regional peace, stability and the international order.\nWang made the comments as he cochaired the latest round of the high-level strategic dialogue between China and the European Union alongside EU foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell, according to a statement from the Chinese foreign ministry, Reuters reported.\nCoordinating Maritime Affairs and Investment Minister Luhut Pandjaitan meanwhile called for deeper cooperation between the two countries, which he described as \"resilient\", especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\"The dynamics of the international situation nowadays have created multifaceted challenges that require stronger cooperation [...] The cooperation in mitigating the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is a testament to that resilience,\" Luhut said in his speech during the same event.\nLuhut also said that China and Indonesia could take the current relationship to a new height especially next year when Indonesia took over as chair of the Group of 20 leading economies.\nThe senior minister expected that President Xi could join the summit in person in Bali and take a tour around the country to see the progress in some of the infrastructure projects that are part of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).\n\"Next year when Indonesia holds the presidency of the G20, President Xi will be able to witness the implementation of several of our strategic projects. These projects started in 2014 when President Joko Widodo proposed his vision of a global maritime fulcrum, which relates profoundly to the concept of the Belt and Road Initiative, designed by China in 2013,\" Luhut said.

(JP/Wienda Parwitasari)\nT\nhe Finance Ministry has announced a plan to inject Rp 4.3 trillion (US$300.1 million) from the state budget into the Jakarta-Bandung high-speed railway project, so that construction of the infrastructure can continue.\nFinance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati told lawmakers on Monday that the funds were to cover capital that the consortium of four state-owned enterprises comprising the Indonesian side had failed to put up at the beginning of the project in 2015.\nThe largest equity commitment was from state-owned plantation company PTPN VIII with Rp 3.1 trillion, followed by state-owned toll road operator Jasa Marga with Rp 540 billion, state-owned railway company PT Kereta Api Indonesia (KAI) with Rp 440 billion and state-owned construction company Wijaya Karya with Rp 240 billion.\n\u201cAt the time, these four SOEs were confident that they could provide the required base equity. In reality, they were unable to deposit it,\u201d Sri Mulyani said during a hearing at the House of Representatives, adding that it was actually their responsibility, as the project was a business-to-business (B2B) scheme.\nRead also:\nJakarta-Bandung high-speed train gets bigger govt backing after cost overrun\nSri Mulyani said this base equity was vital for the China Development Bank (CDB), acting as lender to the project, to disburse the required loan to proceed with the construction.\nThe project has been at the mercy of the CDB, which at one point decided it could no longer provide the necessary funding because of the missing equity.\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nRelated Articles\nAnalysis: SOEs superholding Danantara launch delayed, uncertainty looms\nHouse drafts bill to put Finance Ministry in charge of SOE dividends\nSOEs Ministry installs Prabowo\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9 as Pertamina CEO\nChina\u2019s diplomacy: Building a community with a shared future for mankind\nWhoosh prices to fluctuate with customer demand\nRelated Article\nAnalysis: SOEs superholding Danantara launch delayed, uncertainty looms\nHouse drafts bill to put Finance Ministry in charge of SOE dividends\nSOEs Ministry installs Prabowo\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9 as Pertamina CEO\nChina\u2019s diplomacy: Building a community with a shared future for mankind\nWhoosh prices to fluctuate with customer demand\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nMore in News\nView more\nOpinion\nAnalysis: Govt adopts mandatory B35 biodiesel program as CPO prices tumble\nBusiness\nGlobal chip crunch stunts Indonesia car sales recovery\nBusiness\nXL profit falls in Q3 as tower sale income dries\nHighlight\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEditorial\nNarrow margin\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nThe Latest\nView more\nEconomy\nRI identifies 29 potential nuclear power plant sites\nEconomy\nChinese authorities are considering a weaker yuan as Trump trade risks loom, sources say\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia commences evacuation of 37 citizens in Damascus\nTech\nUS finalizes $6.1 billion Micron chip-making subsidy\nArchipelago\nTwo foreign visitors killed in tree collapse in Monkey Forest\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEconomy\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources\nRegulations\nBullion bank to launch in first half of next year, Airlangga says",

Initiated by China, it was meant to assist developing countries in need of building infrastructure, which needs much funding and investment. But since its inception, the BRI has undergone changes to become a common endeavor of many countries and international organizations for joint cooperation in infrastructure projects.\nImmediately after its inception, it was recognized that the BRI should be broadened beyond infrastructure development, and include cooperation on trade, finance and people-to-people relations to get off the ground effectively. As the program has become very big and all-encompassing, it has become a global effort.\nAt the Second BRI Forum held on April 24 to 26 in Beijing, 126 countries and 29 international organizations signed BRI cooperation agreements. This, indeed, marked an important development\nMeanwhile, with the participation of countries, including think tanks and research institutions, both national and international, much feedback and intellectual support has been received by the Chinese government and other institutions through the efforts of the Development Research Center of the State Council (DRC), which oversees the cooperation of think tanks, called the Silk Road Think Tank Network (SiLKS) set up in 2017.\nSince then the Chinese government has welcomed more feedback and input on the BRI, and acknowledged that BRI cooperation should be open, transparent, zero-tolerance for corruption and a green initiative of its programs with sustainability in mind. Through these efforts, the DRC and Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) Indonesia conducted joint research on Indonesia\u2019s participation in the BRI and what it means for Indonesia\u2019s economic development.\nThe study has been delivered to both governments as important feedback and for Indonesia it has become input for building public awareness. At the beginning, the BRI idea was skeptically received by the public, but following dissemination of the study and the improved programs, public opinion has turned around.\nIn this context, the efforts taken in creating wider networking and cooperation among think tanks as initiated by the Xinhua Institute were welcomed by all invited think tanks and their readiness to participate in this new initiative, the Belt and Road Studies Network (BRSN).\nIf and when some emerging economies do not have enough capacity to conduct their own studies for their participation in the BRI, the BRSN can provide assistance and support.\nIn light of United States President Donald Trump\u2019s initiative for \u201cAmerica First\u201d principles in US foreign policy, which rejects multilateralism, and to put its own economy first, it is imperative for others to cooperate closer in order to fill in the gaps or lacuna in the global economic order created by such a unilateralist policy. One of form of cooperation is the BRI strategy as initiated by China but which is meant for the international community as a whole.\nThe participation of more countries and institutions in the BRI has improved the idea for open, transparent, zero tolerance for corruption, green and sustainable cooperation. For this purpose, the BRI also invited developed countries to join, so the BRI could really serve as a force for global cooperation and integration, and to maintain the global system as best as possible. The alignment of the BRI with 29 international cooperation agreements is of critical importance to its functioning as reinforcement of international order.\nWhat is most important in China\u2019s effort through the BRI, under its theme of \u201cBuilding a community with a shared future for mankind\u201d, is access to market and technologies. In summary, China will have to engage in benefaction in order to secure strong support from other economies. Sharing the Chinese market and technology resources particularly with developing BRI economies is apparently a very good strategy.\nMeeting the challenges of inclusive and sustainable development is a herculean task to perform irrespective of the levels of policy-making one talks about. In theory, the best approach to such development is well-shared, distributed technology progress in all areas of application: information and communication technologies (ICT), genetic engineering, artificial intelligence and technology-enhanced culture.\nWith ICT, farmers can trade with far-away places at reduced transaction costs. With genome engineering, agricultural and animal husbandry productivity can be raised multiplicatively, health care can be improved and the burden of diseases reduced. Digitalization of culture such as augmented reality raises the tradability of culture within and across borders. In all these new technologies, China is one of the recognized leaders.\nChina should leverage that technology leadership to advance the BRI. \u201cTechno BRI\u201d with diverse windows of cooperation should be made an important block of the BRI. Each window would be opened to participation to all countries on carefully negotiated terms and conditions of participation.\nIn designing and implementing \u201cTechno BRI\u201d, lessons can be drawn from European Union technology programs and enriched with Chinese experiences with the ideation, research and development, prototyping, acquisition of intellectual property, incubation and start-up and up-scaling. Success in \u201cTechno BRI\u201d will contribute to sustainable catching up, allowing developing economies to grow at higher added value and technology leaders to reap greater benefits from their hard-earned technological advantage.\n***\nThe writer is the vice chair, board of trustees, CSIS Foundation.\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nRelated Articles\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nIndonesia should think twice about joining BRICS and OECD\nChina to curbs exports of key chipmaking components to US\nChina lifts final bans on Australian red meat as trade row nears end\nHarnessing historical narratives for national pride, unity\nRelated Article\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nIndonesia should think twice about joining BRICS and OECD\nChina to curbs exports of key chipmaking components to US\nChina lifts final bans on Australian red meat as trade row nears end\nHarnessing historical narratives for national pride, unity\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nMore in Academia\nView more\nAcademia\nThe bottom-up wave of democratic rejuvenation\nAcademia\nPolice brutality: Fundamental problems in the institution\nAcademia\nFree trade deals increase Indonesian imports more than exports\nHighlight\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEditorial\nNarrow margin\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nThe Latest\nView more\nPolitics\nGovt to make KPK sole graft-fighting agency\nEconomy\nRI identifies 29 potential nuclear power plant sites\nEconomy\nChinese authorities are considering a weaker yuan as Trump trade risks loom, sources say\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia commences evacuation of 37 citizens in Damascus\nTech\nUS finalizes $6.1 billion Micron chip-making subsidy\nArchipelago\nTwo foreign visitors killed in tree collapse in Monkey Forest\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEconomy\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources",

The third debate covered issues of international relations, defense and security. (Antara/Aditya Pradana Putra)\nThe recent presidential debate, centered around the Indonesia\u2019s position in international affairs, may not have captivated the public, who often prioritize issues like the economy and corruption. However, the candidates' views on foreign policy offer a profound insight into their broader vision for Indonesia's role on the world stage.\nWorldviews in international relations typically fall within two major spectra: Hobbesian and Grotian. The Hobbesian perspective, rooted in realism, perceives the state position at the global level through the lenses of military and economic might. It is a self-help system where states prioritize their own survival and interests, measuring their influence by material capabilities.\nFor middle powers, this translates into an influence shaped by military strength and economic resources in an environment rife with inevitable conflict. This also implies an influence directly proportional to their military prowess and economic clout.\nIn such a competitive arena, a middle power like Indonesia is compelled to continuously expand its economic and military capabilities. This relentless pursuit of growth and strength is perceived as the only route for a middle power to garner respect and assert its presence internationally.\nContrastingly, the Grotian perspective emphasizes legal norms and institutions. It highlights how the state can wield significant influence beyond mere material power. This approach underscores the power of diplomatic engagement, coalition-building and active participation in shaping international norms and leading initiatives in human rights and environmental stewardship.\nPower here is not just about material capabilities but also the capacity to shape ideas and lead in the global community. For a middle power, this means actively engaging in regional and global agenda-setting, becoming a norm entrepreneur and fostering solidarity that resonates with other nations. In this context, the power of ideas and diplomatic finesse is deemed crucial for gaining respect and influence at the global level.\nPresidential candidate\nAnies Baswedan\naligns with the Grotian worldview. His approach to power is multifaceted, extending beyond traditional domains to include cultural influence. He champions the concept of soft power, where influence is exerted through cultural appeal, political values and foreign policy.\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nRelated Articles\nReengineering culture to sustain Prabowo\u2019s leadership\nForeign policy will support domestic agenda: Minister\nASEAN in the global economy: A half-century journey\nMass casualty attacks in China put focus on mental health as economy slows\nIndonesia touts China sea deal without concession\nRelated Article\nReengineering culture to sustain Prabowo\u2019s leadership\nForeign policy will support domestic agenda: Minister\nASEAN in the global economy: A half-century journey\nMass casualty attacks in China put focus on mental health as economy slows\nIndonesia touts China sea deal without concession\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nMore in Opinion\nView more\nAcademia\nThe bottom-up wave of democratic rejuvenation\nAcademia\nPolice brutality: Fundamental problems in the institution\nAcademia\nFree trade deals increase Indonesian imports more than exports\nHighlight\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEditorial\nNarrow margin\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nThe Latest\nView more\nEconomy\nChinese authorities are considering a weaker yuan as Trump trade risks loom, sources say\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia commences evacuation of 37 citizens in Damascus\nTech\nUS finalizes $6.1 billion Micron chip-making subsidy\nArchipelago\nTwo foreign visitors killed in tree collapse in Monkey Forest\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEconomy\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources\nRegulations\nBullion bank to launch in first half of next year, Airlangga says\nMiddle East and Africa\nAirline pilots, crews voice concerns about Middle East routes",

JP/Ricky Yudhistira\nThe Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or ASEAN, was established on Aug. 8, 1967 in Bangkok, Thailand, with the signing of the ASEAN Declaration (Bangkok Declaration) by the founding fathers of ASEAN, namely Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore and Thailand.\nBrunei Darussalam then joined on Jan. 7, 1984, Vietnam on July 28, 1995, Laos and Myanmar on July 23, 1997, and Cambodia on April 30, 1999, making up what is today the 10 member states of ASEAN.\nThe ASEAN Vision 2020, adopted by the ASEAN Leaders on the 30th Anniversary of ASEAN, agreed on a shared vision of ASEAN as a concert of Southeast Asian nations, outward looking, living in peace, stability and prosperity, bonded together in partnership in dynamic development and in a caring community.\nWhen the group was founded in 1967, it was a loose regional organization. In its journey after four decades, ASEAN now has a complete charter, which gives it a legal entity, and a grand design to build an ASEAN Community that is a caring and sharing society.\nAt the 9th ASEAN Summit in 2003, ASEAN Leaders resolved that an ASEAN Community shall be established to create a stronger ASEAN to accomplish this mission and bring peace and prosperity to its 600 million people.\nAll the members agreed to build the community with three pillars \u2014 ASEAN Political-Security Community (APSC), ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) and ASEAN Socio-Cultural Community (ASCC) \u2014 by 2015.\nEach pillar has its own blueprint, and, together with the Initiative for ASEAN Integration (IAI) Strategic Framework and IAI Work Plan Phase II (2009-2015), they form the Roadmap for and ASEAN Community 2009-2015.\nAt the 12th ASEAN Summit in January 2007, the Leaders affirmed their strong commitment to accelerate the establishment of an ASEAN Community by 2015 and signed the Cebu Declaration on the Acceleration of the Establishment of an ASEAN Community by 2015.\nSimultaneously, ASEAN is creating a common political platform to formulate a common perception regarding global issues. Indonesia put forward a new initiative for the 2011 ASEAN chairmanship, the ASEAN Community in a Global Community of Nations. It is an appropriate move and a first step in the right direction, especially to address the challenges that will emerge after 2015.\nAccording to CSIS executive director Rizal Sukma, ASEAN must introduce a sanctions mechanism in implementing the ASEAN agenda.\n\u201cMember states must change the ASEAN Charter to include a sanctions mechanism. Then and only then will ASEAN progress. Currently it is voluntary to implement ASEAN agreements,\u201d Rizal said.\nASEAN\u2019s main weakness as well as strength is its diversity. There is a huge difference among member countries in terms of incomes, human capital, political systems, institutions and infrastructure etc.\nThe biggest challenge for ASEAN is how to involve people in the core processes of ASEAN. There is no representation of \u201cthe people\u201d. There is a notion that it is an organization of officials. Indonesia, the current chair of ASEAN, wants to change this perception and to give more say to the people in ASEAN affairs.\n\u201cWe want ASEAN to be a people-centered, people-oriented and people-driven organization. People should benefit from ASEAN, then and only then is it meaningful,\u201d Foreign Ministry\u2019s director-general of ASEAN Cooperation Djauhari Oratmangun said.\nAs the 2011 global financial and fiscal crises in Europe and America continue to afflict countries and economies across all regions in all continents, the crises have led to growing perceptions in Asia that the distribution of power in global political, economic and security circles is leading to important alignments between the Atlantic and East Asia, said Juwono Sudarsono, professor of international relations and geopolitics at the University of Indonesia.\n\u201cAs the meeting point of the Northeast Asia and Southeast Asia nexus, the upcoming ASEAN Summit in Bali presents a strategic opportunity for countries in the region to co-determine the terms and conditions of these ongoing power shifts. Now, more than ever before, hard military power depends on smart fiscal soundness, financial strength, market performance and political resilience.\u201d\n\u201cASEAN leaders in government, business and the defense-security services have vital roles in preparing next generation political, business and security leaders able to map out networks of collaboration throughout Southeast Asia. Foreign, home, trade and finance ministry officials need to hone their knowledge and gut instincts to enhance leadership skills combining political, economic and military \u201csituational awareness\u201d with higher levels of \u201cprofessional competence\u201d.\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nRelated Articles\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nFree trade deals increase Indonesian imports more than exports\nIndonesia\u2019s tourist sector: A new era of innovation and growth\nPresident Prabowo should make Indonesia a global champion of democracy\nNew mosque in Nusantara to replace Istiqlal as state mosque\nRelated Article\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nFree trade deals increase Indonesian imports more than exports\nIndonesia\u2019s tourist sector: A new era of innovation and growth\nPresident Prabowo should make Indonesia a global champion of democracy\nNew mosque in Nusantara to replace Istiqlal as state mosque\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nMore in News\nView more\nOpinion\nAnalysis: Govt adopts mandatory B35 biodiesel program as CPO prices tumble\nBusiness\nGlobal chip crunch stunts Indonesia car sales recovery\nBusiness\nXL profit falls in Q3 as tower sale income dries\nHighlight\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEditorial\nNarrow margin\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nThe Latest\nView more\nPolitics\nGovt to make KPK sole graft-fighting agency\nEconomy\nRI identifies 29 potential nuclear power plant sites\nEconomy\nChinese authorities are considering a weaker yuan as Trump trade risks loom, sources say\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia commences evacuation of 37 citizens in Damascus\nTech\nUS finalizes $6.1 billion Micron chip-making subsidy\nArchipelago\nTwo foreign visitors killed in tree collapse in Monkey Forest\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEconomy\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources",

This is an enormous opportunity as our market is projected to double to US$2 trillion by 2030.\nThe council endorsed working toward carbon neutrality, including growing industries in the green, blue and circular economy. We are working on positioning the region as a global electric vehicle production hub and enhancing environmental management.\nPlus, in response to the global crisis, we advanced strengthening food security and nutrition.\nDeepening regional and global market integration, and strengthening efforts toward a single, seamless market by 2045, continue to be our overarching focus. To this end, we are investing in education, skills and healthy innovation systems, removing non-tariff barriers to trade, and promoting cross-border technology-led investment.\nThis will enable our industries and businesses to be more integrated and make higher value-added contributions to global value chains. By doing so, we can boost incomes and revenues throughout the region, and achieve our goal of becoming highly competitive, with equitable, cohesive and resilient economic development.\nAs we near the end of the ASEAN 2025 Blueprint, the council emphasized that we can no longer continue with business as usual. To strengthen competitiveness and productivity, member states need to accelerate the pace and scale of domestic policy reform.\nOur community must work harder to close the development gaps between member states and sub-national regions so that we move forward together.

(AFP/Rahmat Mirza)\nT\nwelve refugees have committed suicide in the past two years. Dozens of other are on the edge of suicide as hundreds of mental health cases become active monthly across refugee communities.\nThe latest suicide took place last March in Tanjung Pinang refugee community. Three months later, it was followed by another unsuccessful attempt. Many have linked the incidents to the recent lockdown we faced due to the high number of COVID-19 cases\u2014nearly 200 out of 400 refugees were infected, all confined to live in a 500-square-meter area.\nWhat underlies suicide attempts among refugees is far more profound and complicated than the pandemic alone. COVID-19 may strike refugees in a suicidal mood, but the actual roots of the suicide include living for years with an obscure future, chronic distress over the debilitating situation of their families in conflict areas back in their countries of origin, and being ostracized from the normal way of living in the host community.\nIndonesia is increasingly becoming a graveyard for refugees who are taking their lives because of prolonged statelessness. According to a recent report from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, 13,497 refugees live in Indonesia, and the majority sought asylum in 2013 and 2014. Each year, fewer than 5 percent of refugees get resettled to a third country.\nThat small likelihood of success distances the refugees from their future. As human beings, we live our present time with the perception of the future in mind and experience of the past in our behavior. Imagine, going to sleep each night with the thoughts that you cannot return to your origin country \u2014 facing the threat of guns, nor look toward a promising future, resettlement.\nLiving at peace in the presence of your family seems more unattainable with every day that passes. For 365 days, those thoughts might be upsetting and increasingly lead to despair. After 1,000 days, those thoughts move beyond upset and despair to depression\u2014and from there finding relief in a rope around one\u2019s neck, which is why refugees begin to take their lives after three to four years trapped in statelessness.\nIf 1,000 days turn into 2,500 days, you may ask why all refugees have not hanged themselves rather than questioning why a refugee attempts suicide.\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nRelated Articles\nIndonesia\u2019s tourist sector: A new era of innovation and growth\n20 years of the Aceh tsunami: From \u2018megathrust\u2019 threat to disaster mitigation\nAuthorities to relocate thousands around Lewotobi after eruptions\nBroadening the prospects for shared future of China-ASEAN community\n\u2018Bullied\u2019 medical resident at Diponegoro University commits suicide\nRelated Article\nIndonesia\u2019s tourist sector: A new era of innovation and growth\n20 years of the Aceh tsunami: From \u2018megathrust\u2019 threat to disaster mitigation\nAuthorities to relocate thousands around Lewotobi after eruptions\nBroadening the prospects for shared future of China-ASEAN community\n\u2018Bullied\u2019 medical resident at Diponegoro University commits suicide\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nMore in Academia\nView more\nAcademia\nThe bottom-up wave of democratic rejuvenation\nAcademia\nPolice brutality: Fundamental problems in the institution\nAcademia\nFree trade deals increase Indonesian imports more than exports\nHighlight\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEditorial\nNarrow margin\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nThe Latest\nView more\nPolitics\nGovt to make KPK sole graft-fighting agency\nEconomy\nRI identifies 29 potential nuclear power plant sites\nEconomy\nChinese authorities are considering a weaker yuan as Trump trade risks loom, sources say\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia commences evacuation of 37 citizens in Damascus\nTech\nUS finalizes $6.1 billion Micron chip-making subsidy\nArchipelago\nTwo foreign visitors killed in tree collapse in Monkey Forest\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEconomy\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources",

He said that what China had to avoid was embarking on an old strategy that was no longer valid for the future, such as happened in Europe at the end of the 19th century, which resulted in the outbreak of World War I. China had to remain free of power politics, the Cold War and hegemonic competition.\nAs we are experiencing today, elements of competition exist, but so do elements of cooperation and coordination in big-power relations, making the idea of hegemonic competition almost impossible.\nEconomic interdependence and, to a certain extent, global and regional integration have prevented that from happening. In addition, developing nations have developed and modernized, becoming an important part of the world and making hegemonic economic dominance impossible for the last half decade.\nFor China, which might become the world\u2019s biggest economy by GDP in the next 10 years or so, its biggest challenges will be how to behave and how its role should be formulated as a big economic power. &nbsp;\nIn this effort, China must also take huge domestic problems into consideration, as well as its dependence on natural resources, energy and advanced technology.\nChina has no ambitions to become a global superpower, because it recognizes its limitations and willingness to run other parts of the world.&nbsp; This has never been an ambition of China throughout history. China has always been big. Its ambition is mainly to be recognized by others, and not to run over or to subdue others.\nAdmittedly, Southeast Asia or ASEAN\u2019s member nations have their differences in their respective policies toward China. However, in general, the region accepts that China is an important and strategic partner and that economically China is and will become more important. Historically, China has always been accepted and recognized as an important country in the region, and the region has to pay attention to the nation. &nbsp;\nIf hegemony is almost impossible, then China\u2019s peaceful rise has to be taken as the best strategy for China and for the region. A peaceful rise in connection with regional institutions might be just the right strategy for China and the East Asian region, because they share common interests, although strengthening bilateral relations is also of paramount importance.\nIn concrete terms, the first step needed to solidify the common interests of ASEAN and China is the creation of a Code of Conduct (CoC) on the South China Sea based on the accepted Declaration of Conduct (DoC) of the South China Sea. The idea is to establish a regional mechanism to prevent conflict or to overcome or manage conflicts if they arise. This CoC is not intended to resolve overlapping claims, but to create an atmosphere for stability and peace, and in doing so make it easier to find a solution in the future. &nbsp;\nAchieving such results in the South China Sea would have a good follow-on effect on the East China Sea problems of the Daiyou/Senkaku Islands claimed by both China and Japan. Those two nations should be encouraged to engage in joint cooperation as was promised before but never implemented.&nbsp; Here, China should be more moderate and nuanced in its actions and reactions, while Japan must accept that these problems are historical and related to the end of World War II. It is important to encourage centrist-oriented policies on World War II legacy issues. Otherwise, it will make resolving the issues more complicated for the whole East Asia region.\nChina and Japan have to establish direct lines of communications between their leaders, political and military, and put in place arrangements to prevent incidents that could develop into conflicts or wars in the future. Trust, in the end, has to be established by both sides. &nbsp;\nThe US role and policies should also be commensurate with the nuances of the region. The US pivot toward East Asia was not a thought-out policy, but instead is the result of a wrong gut reaction that was obviously misinterpreted by the Chinese, as the pivot started with US security increases in the region. The US should have well-rounded presence in the region, especially in economic terms.\nRegional common interests also cover the economic field.&nbsp; In trade, both the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) and Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) can be complementary, if the US is willing to lower the TPP threshold, while the RCEP should raise its threshold to become more meaningful for the region to participate. Only then the most maximum results can be achieved for the benefit of the region. Neither China nor the US should exclude anyone.\nIf the aforementioned policy changes can be adjusted, then there is no reason why China\u2019s strategy for a peaceful rise based on shared common interests can be carried out and well accepted.\nThe writer is vice chairman of the board of trustees at the Centre for the Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) Foundation.\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nRelated Articles\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nFree trade deals increase Indonesian imports more than exports\nIndonesia\u2019s tourist sector: A new era of innovation and growth\nPresident Prabowo should make Indonesia a global champion of democracy\nNew mosque in Nusantara to replace Istiqlal as state mosque\nRelated Article\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nFree trade deals increase Indonesian imports more than exports\nIndonesia\u2019s tourist sector: A new era of innovation and growth\nPresident Prabowo should make Indonesia a global champion of democracy\nNew mosque in Nusantara to replace Istiqlal as state mosque\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nMore in News\nView more\nOpinion\nAnalysis: Govt adopts mandatory B35 biodiesel program as CPO prices tumble\nBusiness\nGlobal chip crunch stunts Indonesia car sales recovery\nBusiness\nXL profit falls in Q3 as tower sale income dries\nHighlight\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEditorial\nNarrow margin\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nThe Latest\nView more\nPolitics\nGovt to make KPK sole graft-fighting agency\nEconomy\nRI identifies 29 potential nuclear power plant sites\nEconomy\nChinese authorities are considering a weaker yuan as Trump trade risks loom, sources say\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia commences evacuation of 37 citizens in Damascus\nTech\nUS finalizes $6.1 billion Micron chip-making subsidy\nArchipelago\nTwo foreign visitors killed in tree collapse in Monkey Forest\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEconomy\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources",

The government has accelerated vaccination programs ahead of Idul Fitri in May, when many people leave the capital and return back to their hometowns. (AFP/Adek Berry)\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has taught us many things about ourselves and the world, but one of the clearest, most important lessons is that the world can and must be better prepared for future pandemic threats.&nbsp;\nSolidarity, multilateralism, shared knowledge and technological strength are essential elements as we seek to emerge from COVID-19 and to build a world capable of protecting itself from another pandemic.\nIndonesia and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness (CEPI) have a shared vision for a new global health architecture that can prepare the world to face future pandemic threats. That vision is centered on minimizing and ultimately ending pandemic threats, and it is built on of the need for greater global resilience, greater and more accessible financing, greater commitment to technology and scientific capacity, and above all, greater international collaboration.&nbsp;\nIndonesia and CEPI share the goal of fostering an international approach to the scientific research and development work needed to create tools that can significantly reduce future epidemic and pandemic risks.\nBuilding this new and dynamic system will require the commitment of every government in every region of the world, and Indonesia is leading those efforts through its Group of 20 presidency. As president of the G20 during 2022, Indonesia has been instrumental in the creation of the new Financial Intermediary Fund (FIF) for Pandemic Prevention, Preparedness and Response (PPR), which has now raised more than US$1 billion from a number of far-sighted national and institutional donors.&nbsp;\nThe creation of the FIF, which has CEPI as one of its implementing partners along with the Global Fund and Gavi, represents a vital and concrete step in the building of a more resilient, more prepared global health system.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nThe FIF will provide a dedicated stream of additional, long-term financing for PPR as well as a critical platform for coordination. The money in this fund will also, in part, be used to support fair, equitable and swift access to medical countermeasures such as vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics in the event of a looming pandemic threat.&nbsp;\nTo secure that equitable access, governments and the private sector must cooperate to ensure that capabilities to develop and produce countermeasure are widely distributed, robust, and scalable in the event of a public health emergency. This will require significant expansion and geographical diversification of global manufacturing and research capabilities in all regions.\nThrough its G20 presidency, Indonesia envisions would like to see greater standardization or regionalization of manufacturing and research hubs, not just in the Global North, but also in the Global South. Vaccine equity has proved an elusive goal throughout the COVID-19 pandemic and will remain so until we create sustainable research and vaccine manufacturing facilities in lower- and middle-income countries across the world.\nAs it prepares to hold its annual board meeting in Bali during Indonesia\u2019s G20 presidency, CEPI is uniquely placed to help governments alike and international organizations work together to strengthen the world\u2019s defenses against disease threats. And together we are urging governments and financing bodies to collaborate on mobilizing the investments needed in national health systems, in capacity expansion for vaccines, diagnostics and other medical defenses, and in outbreak response plans.\nDeeper cooperation is needed, too, in the fields of surveillance, data sharing and standards. Indonesia, as G20 president, is actively encouraging the development of virus-related data sharing collaborations between countries&nbsp;through the G20 Forum. Laboratory expertise such as the identification, characterization and genetic sequencing of new, emerging and mutating pathogens must also be integrated and shared around the world.&nbsp;\nProgress against these goals will be necessary if we are to meaningfully accelerate the development of countermeasures in the future and CEPI applauds Indonesia\u2019s leadership and wholeheartedly supports Indonesia\u2019s efforts in these regards.\nTo be leaders in health security and play their part in the global community, countries need to strengthen cooperation and learn the lessons of the COVID-19 pandemic. Indonesia and CEPI are committed to helping nations come together for peaceful cooperation that extends beyond the COVID-19 crisis, building global capacity and systems and ensuring sustained political, financial, and societal commitment over years and decades to come.\nOnly by investing in what matters will the world bolster global health security and protect itself and its people against future pandemics.\n&nbsp;***\nBudi Gunadi Sadikin is Indonesian health minister.

It is also encouraging that the MSG will go on a fact-finding mission to West Papua. The media can play a role in this by hopefully being allowed by the authorities to accompany the fact-finding mission as a way of showing the openness of the process.

The institutional category is meant to denote water services provided by ordinary water utilities (PDAM) whereas the \u201ccommunity-based\u201d category is meant to denote water services provided by local community associations.\nThe community category is predominantly found in rural Indonesia, although in some cases it is also applicable in urban settings untouched by PDAM services. According to some sources, while the majority of PDAM are currently ailing and in financial trouble, the community category has been very successful and now constitutes more than half of Indonesia\u2019s total water services.\nIn many ways, the community category \u2014 supported by the 2003 policy \u2014 has been a successful endeavour of the government, local communities and donors. Nevertheless, there are problems with both the concept and implementation of the community-based system that threatens its sustainability.\nAlthough cited in various documents by donor institutions, the typology made by the 2003 policy, which categorizes water services into \u201cinstitutional\u201d and \u201ccommunity\u201d categories, is flawed.\nThis is because the community is also a form of institution and delivers water services through formal organisations.\nThe second problem is the term \u201ccommunity\u201d itself. What do we mean by it? Perhaps the term community is used to distinguish from other entities such as corporations. But what if, for example, a particular local community owned shares in a water corporation? Could we not say that the corporation was community-based?\nThe third problem is the notion of community ownership. Many donors and water activists assume that community ownership is self-explanatory in practice.\nThe assumption is that when a donor institution disburses funds to build water service infrastructure in remote villages, the community will \u201cown\u201d that infrastructure. This is incorrect.\nThe truth is that the so called \u201ccommunity\u201d in the context of water services cannot be legally identified. Therefore, water services assets can only be owned by a legal entity and not directly by the individuals of\nthe community.\nFor example, an individual in a village does not directly own a communal toilet. He or she can \u201cown\u201d a toilet via the entity that owns it, such as a cooperative, a foundation or an association that has been\naccorded legal entity status, or even a corporation.\nThus, the notion of community ownership is flawed, for it is not the community that owns water services assets, but the legal entity in which the individuals of the community can be members.\nIn this respect, the key issue is whether the legal entity owning the water assets is sufficiently democratic in terms of its decision making process.\nThe questions that donor institutions should ask are whether women are adequately represented and whether marginal groups\u2019 access to water is guaranteed.\nActivists need to be wary of power politics and whether patriarchal relations are embodied into legal entities. This is done by evaluating the entity\u2019s articles of association and its application.\nThe fourth problem is with respect to its assets. I said earlier that a community can only \u201cown\u201d water services assets through a legal entity. Under the Indonesian legal system, the process of forming a legal entity is very cumbersome and can take up to more than a year.\nVillage communities often do not have means at their disposal to handle this. In one research project, I found no clarity as to who owned the infrastructure assets built by donor funds.\nThe fifth problem relates to the fourth, namely, its operation and maintenance. Without clarity on asset ownership, no one is responsible for maintenance.\nIn turn, assets will be abandoned by the population due to a lack of maintenance. Ownerless assets also mean that they are vulnerable to confiscation or expropriation from third parties, like developers or powerful village figures.\nThe sixth problem relates to incoherencies in the national legal framework. Due to (unproductive) debates on water privatization, the government prioritises PDAM to provide water services in Indonesia and leaves the community and private sector only a secondary role. As a result, there is a lack of recognition and standards for non-PDAM services in national law.\nThe trend now is for some regions to enact regional bylaws on community-based water services and due to problems number three and four above, resort to village government to own and maintain assets.\nHowever, the bylaw is often inconsistent with national legislation and often there are areas of overlap and even clashes between PDAM and community-based water services.\nFurthermore, resorting to villages \u2014 which in a way, are state instruments \u2014 means that we are moving away from community-based water and back toward traditional state provision.\nThe community-based water system has (so far) been a tremendous success in improving access to water in Indonesia and the credit goes partially to donor funds.\nBut without a clear conceptual framework, without clarity on who owns and who is able to own assets and without support from national legislation, the sustainability of community-based water services is of great concern.\nThe writer, who obtained a PhD from the University of Dundee, lectures at Ibn Khaldun University\u2019s school of law in Bogor, West Java.

(asean.org/-)\nI\nn the past five years, the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) has become a global public good with vitality and creativity. To date, more than 150 countries and international organizations have signed BRI cooperation agreements with China.\nUnder the BRI, 82 overseas economic cooperation zones have been set up in the participating countries in a short period. Trade between China and BRI partner countries has exceeded US$6 trillion. The more than $80 billion in Chinese investment in these countries has created 240,000 local jobs.\nWhy has the BRI been so popular and won so much support? To sum up, first, it follows the principle of equality and mutual benefits. Second, it aims for a win-win outcome. Third, it is open and inclusive. Fourth, it synergizes development strategies. Fifth, it is based on rules and the rule of law.\nASEAN is the key direction and important participant in the BRI. In the past five years, a large number of cooperation projects between China and ASEAN countries have been incorporated into the BRI cooperation framework. More and more practical cooperation plans are being actively explored.\nThere are advantages of China and ASEAN\u2019s cooperation under the BRI. First is political advantage. The Belt and Road cooperation requires solid political mutual trust. The political relationship between China and ASEAN is very strong, evident in the fact that China is the first dialogue partner of ASEAN to accede to the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation in Southeast Asia and to forge a strategic partnership with ASEAN.\nLast year, both sides issued the China-ASEAN Strategic Partnership Vision 2030, which laid out a medium-and long-term blueprint.\nLeaders from China and ASEAN countries have maintained close exchanges. At the annual China-ASEAN Summit, the leaders will hold candid discussions on common concerns and make political decisions to ensure that bilateral cooperation proceeds on the right path. Strengthening synergy between the ASEAN development strategy and the BRI has become the consensus of leaders of both sides.\nSecond is institutional system advantage. Under the China-ASEAN cooperation mechanism, the two sides have developed effective cooperation in over 20 fields, such as connectivity, finance, agriculture, information and communication technology, human resources development, investment, energy, culture, tourism, public health, environment and subregional development. China and ASEAN should strengthen BRI cooperation to bring these dialogue mechanisms into full play.\nChina has established a mechanism of dialogue at the vice-premier level or at the ministerial level with several ASEAN countries. Any bilateral cooperation under the BRI can be fully coordinated and promoted through intergovernmental dialogue.\nChina has also signed bilateral investment agreements with several ASEAN countries. There are insurance mechanisms for bilateral cooperation, without \u201ctraps\u201d as claimed by the West. Everything runs under the sun; conspiracy theory is untenable.\nThird is geographical advantage. China and ASEAN countries are close neighbors linked by mountains, rivers and seas. We are a community with a shared future and share weal and woe on the road to common development and prosperity. This has been fully verified by the handling of the two financial crises in 1997 and 2008 with the joint efforts of China and ASEAN.\nAmid rising unilateralism and trade protectionism, China and ASEAN need to work together to seek common development. It is of overriding importance for us to seek self-development, mutually beneficial cooperation and maintain regional sustainable development and prosperity. The BRI cooperation has built a new platform and points to a new direction for China-ASEAN future comprehensive and pragmatic cooperation.\nASEAN is committed to promoting the implementation of the Master Plan on ASEAN Connectivity 2025, which is consistent with the BRI goal to promote regional connectivity. If the two initiatives are successfully synergized, the ASEAN connectivity project will get more support from China and the rest of the world, which will improve its commercial value and meet its long-term development goals.\nFourth is market advantage. China and ASEAN together are a big market with over 2 billion people. Annual trade between them nears $600 billion and total mutual investment has exceeded $200 billion. The financial cooperation, including currency swap arrangements, has also achieved remarkable results.\nPeople-to-people exchange has exceeded 50 million per year, a huge improvement from the past. But it may be just the beginning for the market potentials.\nIn the next 15 years, China\u2019s imports of goods and services are expected to exceed $30 trillion and $10 trillion, respectively. For ASEAN, the next 15 years will also be an important opportunity to expand cooperation with China and accelerate its own development.\nThe Belt and Road cooperation provides a viable opportunity for the integration of the two markets. The two sides have the ability and conditions to tap market potential, mobilize various resources, expand cooperation in various fields and implement mutually beneficial measures to strengthen the win-win situation.\nFifth is people-to-people exchange advantage. China and ASEAN countries have a history of people-to-people exchange. The two sides share similar cultures and customs. The Belt and Road cooperation will help improve infrastructure, expand trade exports, improve people\u2019s employment and living standards, and will certainly gain the understanding and support of people on both sides.\nNearly 30 million Chinese tourists visit Southeast Asia every year. This number will rise with improved infrastructure connectivity. The number of ASEAN tourists visiting China will also increase quickly. The youth are the future and hope for China-ASEAN relations. About 200,000 Chinese and ASEAN students study in each other\u2019s home countries. They are valuable treasures and will surely become the backbone of the BRI.\nChina and ASEAN deserve all the advantages from jointly building the Belt and Road, and will also work together to write a brand new chapter for win-win cooperation in the future.\n***\nThe writer is vice president of the China Public Diplomacy Association\n.\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nRelated Articles\nPrabowo\u2019s great power politics pivot takes center stage\nASEAN, Canada work together for health security\nCampaign #ForABetterWorld recognized as awe-inspiring #MadeinIndonesia app by Google Play\nWong\u2019s ASEAN consolidation\nIndonesia named BRICS partner as Prabowo\u2019s top diplomat makes overseas debut\nRelated Article\nPrabowo\u2019s great power politics pivot takes center stage\nASEAN, Canada work together for health security\nCampaign #ForABetterWorld recognized as awe-inspiring #MadeinIndonesia app by Google Play\nWong\u2019s ASEAN consolidation\nIndonesia named BRICS partner as Prabowo\u2019s top diplomat makes overseas debut\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nMore in Academia\nView more\nAcademia\nThe bottom-up wave of democratic rejuvenation\nAcademia\nPolice brutality: Fundamental problems in the institution\nAcademia\nFree trade deals increase Indonesian imports more than exports\nHighlight\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEditorial\nNarrow margin\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nThe Latest\nView more\nPolitics\nGovt to make KPK sole graft-fighting agency\nEconomy\nRI identifies 29 potential nuclear power plant sites\nEconomy\nChinese authorities are considering a weaker yuan as Trump trade risks loom, sources say\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia commences evacuation of 37 citizens in Damascus\nTech\nUS finalizes $6.1 billion Micron chip-making subsidy\nArchipelago\nTwo foreign visitors killed in tree collapse in Monkey Forest\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEconomy\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources",

(asean.org/-)\nT\nhe latest data from China\u2019s Customs Administration shows two-way trade between China and ASEAN grew by 14.1 percent to a record US$587.87 billion in 2018, compared to 2017. China has been ASEAN\u2019s top trading partner for 10 consecutive years, while ASEAN has been China\u2019s third largest trading partner, after the European Union and the United States, for eight years in a row.\nASEAN, among China\u2019s top seven trading partners in 2018, and China experienced the fastest growth rate of trade last year. Against the slowdown of global economic growth and the prevalence of trade protectionism, the two-way trade between the two parties continues to maintain a sound momentum and it stands head and shoulders above other major trade relations.\nWe also note that the gap between China-ASEAN trade volumes and China-US trade volumes narrowed significantly by about 33 percent from $68.9 billion in 2017 to $457 billion in 2018. This only confirms the huge potential and \u201clate-starting advantage\u201d of China-ASEAN trade.\nAt the same time, as ASEAN\u2019s premier power Indonesia has had increasingly closer trade relations with China. In 2018, Indonesia\u2019s trade with China grew by 22.2 percent to $77.4 billion, the fastest of the 10 ASEAN member states. In particular, sales in China of imports from Indonesia grew significantly to 19.6 percent, a rate only second to the sales in China of imports from Vietnam.&nbsp;\nAccording to the data of China\u2019s Ministry of Commerce, mutual investments continued to increase. In 2018, China\u2019s direct investment flows to ASEAN\u2019s non-financial sectors totaled $9.95 billion, with a year-on-year growth of 5.1 percent, which was faster than the 1.7 percent increase in the previous year. ASEAN investment flows to China were worth $5.72 billion, with a year-on-year growth of 12.5 percent, well above the growth rate of 3.88 percent seen in the previous year.&nbsp;\nBy the end of 2018, China invested $89.01 billion in ASEAN and ASEAN invested $116.7 billion in China, a 22-fold increase in two-way investment in 15 years, especially as China\u2019s investment in ASEAN accelerated.\nThe aforementioned data shows that China and ASEAN are not only good neighbors and good friends. China is also one of ASEAN\u2019s most important trade and investment partners and vice versa. China-ASEAN trade relations are in complete harmony.&nbsp;\nIn 2018, they celebrated the 15th anniversary of the establishment of a strategic partnership. China and ASEAN have joined hands in a new era of greater progress and the relations have developed from a growth stage into a mature stage.\nAs for the next 15 years, President Xi Jinping has proposed to forge a higher level of China-ASEAN strategic partnership and move toward a closer China-ASEAN community with a shared future, pointing out the main direction for the development of bilateral relations. At the 21st China-ASEAN Summit in November last year the two sides issued the China-ASEAN Strategic Partnership Vision 2030, which laid out medium- and long-term plans for future cooperation.&nbsp;\nAs Premier Li Keqiang pointed out during the summit, so long as we firmly confirm our confidence in each other\u2019s development, in bilateral cooperation and in the future of East Asia and work closely together to forge ahead, China-ASEAN relations would surely make greater achievements in the next 15 years and benefit the people of all countries in the region.\nThe rapid development of China-ASEAN economic and trade relations is the result of the joint efforts of governments, enterprises and people from both sides. It can be said our trade relations have got all the advantages.\nIn 2018, the growth rate of China\u2019s total imports and exports along the \u201cBelt and Road\u201d countries was 13.3 percent, which was higher than that of the China\u2019s overall global trade by 3.6 percent. In the same period, the non-financial direct investment of Chinese enterprises along the \u201cBelt and Road\u201d countries was worth $15.64 billion, with a year-on-year growth rate of 8.9 percent, which is 8.6 percent higher than China\u2019s global investment growth rate.&nbsp;\nASEAN is a key area for jointly building the \u201cBelt and Road\u201d and it was in Indonesia that President Xi proposed the important initiative to build the \u201c21st Century Maritime Silk Road\u201d in 2013. As more and more \u201cBelt and Road\u201d cooperation projects are steadily advancing and bearing fruit in ASEAN countries, the potential of trade cooperation between China and ASEAN under the \u201cBelt and Road\u201d framework would continue to be realized.&nbsp;\nIt would be a strong impetus for trade and investment on both sides and would benefit more and more enterprises and people in this region in the future. China is going to hold the Second Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation this year.\nLast November, China hosted the first China International Import Expo (CIIE), where President Xi delivered the keynote speech during the opening ceremony. All ASEAN countries sent high-ranking delegations and high-quality companies to attend the expo.\nBeing the world\u2019s first national-level expo solely for imports, the CIIE demonstrates China\u2019s determination to further open its market to the world. It has also opened a new door for the world\u2019s high-quality goods to enter China\u2019s huge market. It is believed that as the CIIE would be held continually in the future, more and more ASEAN companies would benefit from it.&nbsp;\nIn addition, multilateral and bilateral free trade arrangements have also boosted China-ASEAN economic and trade exchanges. The upgraded protocol of China-ASEAN Free Trade Agreement took effect on Jan. 1. The new rules of origin are more flexible and convenient in the determination of the origin, which would help companies from both sides enjoy more tariff preferences and promote trade between the two sides.&nbsp;\nThe negotiations for the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement, joined by both China and ASEAN, are also expected to conclude in 2019. It is believed that the agreement would be a new booster for the development of China-ASEAN economic and trade relations to leap forward.\nChina is going to hold the second Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation this year. The Belt and Road Initiative was proposed by China and the results of cooperation are benefiting the whole world.&nbsp;\nIn the process of promoting international cooperation in the future, we are willing to strengthen strategic synergy with ASEAN on the basis of the following principles: to seek shared benefits through consultation and collaboration; to ensure transparency, openness and tolerance and abide by international laws and international norms, to promote cooperation projects adhering to high standards, high quality and high levels and to establish financial, environmental and ecological sustainability.&nbsp;\nIt is believed that cooperation between the two sides would continue to deepen and bear more fruit, while the sustainability of development would be enhanced.\n***\nThe writer is Chinese ambassador to ASEAN.\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nRelated Articles\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nVietnam's soaring US trade surplus stokes new fears of tariffs\nChina to curbs exports of key chipmaking components to US\nTaiwan's Lai kicks off Marshall Islands visit as China fumes\nICC\u2019s arrest warrant for Myanmar junta chief is a critical step forward\nRelated Article\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nVietnam's soaring US trade surplus stokes new fears of tariffs\nChina to curbs exports of key chipmaking components to US\nTaiwan's Lai kicks off Marshall Islands visit as China fumes\nICC\u2019s arrest warrant for Myanmar junta chief is a critical step forward\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nMore in Academia\nView more\nAcademia\nThe bottom-up wave of democratic rejuvenation\nAcademia\nPolice brutality: Fundamental problems in the institution\nAcademia\nFree trade deals increase Indonesian imports more than exports\nHighlight\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEditorial\nNarrow margin\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nThe Latest\nView more\nPolitics\nGovt to make KPK sole graft-fighting agency\nEconomy\nRI identifies 29 potential nuclear power plant sites\nEconomy\nChinese authorities are considering a weaker yuan as Trump trade risks loom, sources say\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia commences evacuation of 37 citizens in Damascus\nTech\nUS finalizes $6.1 billion Micron chip-making subsidy\nArchipelago\nTwo foreign visitors killed in tree collapse in Monkey Forest\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEconomy\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources",

Women'\u0080\u0099s empowerment and the next generation are keys to sustainable community improvement and the future of cocoa farming.\nCourtesy of Mondelez International\nBy engaging multiple partners in its Cocoa Life program, Mondelez International supports farming communities in finding real solutions that lead to transformation and sustainability.\nA corporate approach allowing farmers to share their problems has become increasingly popular these days as companies want to make their community assistance programs run effectively.\nThrough shared problems, such as infertile land, low yields and poor access to a market, for example, companies can design a program that meets the farmers'\u0080\u0099 needs, which they commonly undertake under their respective sustainability initiatives.\nMany companies, however, are apt to focus on one or two areas in regard to the relevant aid they give through an average three-year project. Its has led to the frequently raised question as to whether a program has a significant impact on the farming communities in the context of sustainability.\nGiven the increasingly varied and complex issues facing farming communities, the right strategies and approach are therefore needed by companies to significantly contribute to a long-term impact on sustainable farming.\nThis explains why global chocolate company, Mondelez International, is currently running Cocoa Life in six cocoa-producing countries, including Indonesia, with a holistic approach being adopted to support sustainable cocoa supply. Under the holistic approach, a range of concerns facing farming communities are handled through a focus on five pillars: farming, community, livelihood, youth and environment.\nCocoa Life is a holistic sustainability program that reinforces the future of cocoa by empowering today'\u0080\u0099s farming communities and inspiring tomorrow'\u0080\u0099s cocoa generations. Globally, it started three years ago and in Indonesia, it kicked off in September 2013, with the program aimed at cocoa'\u0080\u0093farming communities in Sumatra, Sulawesi and Papua.\nCocoa Life is part of the Call for Well-Being strategy - a platform that Mondelez International uses as a reference in running their business and ensuring environmental safety.\n'\u0080\u009cCall for Well-Being is the company'\u0080\u0099s commitment to marrying sustainability with company growth. This strategy helps Mondelez operate a more sustainable business, not only for us but also for the environment in countries where we operate,'\u0080\u009d said Mondelez Indonesia'\u0080\u0099s managing director Jiri Hejl.\n'\u0080\u009cAs the world'\u0080\u0099s largest chocolate company, we are committed to supporting the success of Cocoa Life and helping ensure a qualified and sustainable cocoa supply.'\u0080\u009d\nMondelez International'\u0080\u0099s Cocoa Program Development Manager for Southeast Asia, Andi Sitti Asmayanti (Yanti), explained that Cocoa Life aimed to strengthen and develop cocoa farmers in Indonesia and ensure sustainable cocoa by embracing young generations around farming sites to become the next farming generation.\nThe 10-year program will run until 2022, targeting more than 200,000 farmers in the six countries, with more than 40,000 farmers in Indonesia.\nTo reach the goal, Cocoa Life works based on three principles: holistic farmer centric, partnership and sourcing alignment.\n&nbsp;'\u0080\u009cWhatever we do with Cocoa Life is intended for farmers and should be seen from the standpoint of farmers, what they really want, so we do not apply top-down but a bottom-up approach in this regard,'\u0080\u009d said Yanti.\nAccording to Yanti, Mondelez, through its partners, is frequently engaged in a discussion with farmers and local governments in the respective provinces to learn their perspectives on what value Cocoa Life will have for farmers, and '\u0080\u009ccertainly from our side what benefits farmers will reap from this program. From the standpoint of productivity, the farmers can adopt the knowledge they have gained to boost their output. We also provide much-needed fertilizer and other plant materials, etc.'\u0080\u009d\nWith the current insignificant role of women in the life of farming communities, efforts should be made to empower women because they have a vital role in developing the next cocoa-farming generation. While, with regard to the environment, '\u0080\u009cthe challenge is how to boost production without causing damage to the environment,'\u0080\u009d she said, adding that each pillar was interrelated.\nMulti-partners\nIn implementing the program, Mondelez engages many partners to enable the program to develop and scale up sustainable cocoa supply so as to meet the objectives. Each pillar entails relevant expertise from the respective partners, which include local and international NGOs.\nBy creating partnerships with communities, governments, national and international NGOs and supply-chain partners, '\u0080\u009cwe can support Cocoa Life communities in finding real solutions that lead to measurable transformation,'\u0080\u009d the company says.\n'\u0080\u009cPartnerships are vital for best practice, sustainability, synergy and scale '\u0080\u0093 they bring competence related to the program objectives '\u0080\u0093 institutions and connectivity with our supply chain. We believe partnership is the key to lasting change,'\u0080\u009d it says.\nApart from partners representing experts in the respective five pillars, the program is also being run in partnership with government bodies including the Ministry of Agriculture, Coordinating Economic Ministry and Indonesian Coffee and Cocoa Research Institute.\nYanti emphasized the importance of transparency in the program in the sense that the partners with their respective fields of expertise work to take a look at the existing issues based on their respective areas.\n'\u0080\u009cFor example, at the level of adoption. They have to find out how the farmers do the farming and find the best ways of farming,'\u0080\u009d she said.\nShe described farmers'\u0080\u0099 various problems and challenges in each targeted province following an assessment by its partner, CARE Indonesia, an international NGO whose key programmatic area of focus includes economic empowerment.\nWhen Cocoa Life entered Lampung, local cocoa farmers had abandoned their land, which they considered unproductive following the last yields of their cocoa trees that have a life span of between 25 and 30 years, but after receiving education under the Cocoa Life program, they began to realize that the area had more choices in terms of land for cocoa farming.\n'\u0080\u009cBased on input that they gave, they have frequently received training and so we assess the extent of the level of knowledge they have and we adjust our training to this level,'\u0080\u009d she said. '\u0080\u009cThe biggest challenge in this regard is to invite them to join the program and see how the program can give added value to them.'\u0080\u009d\nWhile in Sulawesi, most farmers are already knowledgeable about cocoa agriculture and so '\u0080\u009cour great challenge is how to conduct training and at the same time adopt theory into practice on the ground. Room training is conducted for approximately seven days and the rest is direct training in the cocoa farms.'\u0080\u009d\nEach area is similar in terms of measuring activities through the key performance indicators (KPI) and the difference rests on the program focus, which will depend on the stakeholders, according to Yanti.\nVerification\nTo ensure that Mondelez runs the program in a correct way, the program is subject to verification by an independent party after three years, apart from internal monitoring and annual evaluation.\n'\u0080\u009cA Harvard University team conducts research on the program to verify the program itself, whether it has an impact or not, without Mondelez'\u0080\u0099s intervention,'\u0080\u009d said Yanti, adding that they could publish their research results without Mondelez'\u0080\u0099s approval.\nAccording to CARE International Indonesia'\u0080\u0099s Country Director, Helen Vanwell, the independent verification of the program supports Cocoa Life'\u0080\u0099s commitment to the objectives and the KPI that have been set-out.\n'\u0080\u009cVerifying Cocoa Life'\u0080\u0099s impact on the lives of cocoa farmers and their communities, especially women and youth will build greater confidence to increase participation in the program and benefit more communities to join,'\u0080\u009d she pointed out.\nOn the role that CARE Indonesia plays in the program, Vanwell said that while CARE looked at farming issues in the assessment, '\u0080\u009cour key focus was on communities including women and youth. Mondelez through its Cocoa Life program and CARE know that enabling resilient, thriving communities are essential foundations for sustainable cocoa thus benefiting all stakeholders including communities and providing shared value for all.\n'\u0080\u009cIf for example there are no opportunities for youth in cocoa-livelihood opportunities, and to assist a cocoa community they leave, then cocoa farming will not survive,'\u0080\u009d she said.\n'\u0080\u009cCocoa Life aims to identify livelihood opportunities and to assist cocoa communities in building communities that are desirable places to live including for young families.'\u0080\u009d\n'\u0080\u009cThe Cocoa Life program is a good example of how global corporations like Mondelez can transform a business challenge around sustainability of their cocoa supply to provide development solutions that positively impact the lives of thousands of cocoa farmers in their supply chain,'\u0080\u009d she added.\n_________________________\nPartners for Change\nThis page is produced by\nThe Jakarta Post\nin cooperation with Company-Community Partnerships for Health in Indonesia (CCPHI).

Yudo Margono (front left), former commander of Joint Defense Regional Command I, inspects Indonesian troops on Jan. 3, 2020, at a military base in Natuna Islands regency, the Riau Islands, in this handout photo provided by the Indonesian Military (TNI). (AFP/Handout)\nO\nn Sunday, several Indonesian and foreign diplomats texted me to express their shock over the 14-point joint statement, especially point 9, issued after the summit between Chinese President Xi Jinping and visiting President\nPrabowo Subianto\nin Beijing on Saturday. They were curious if Prabowo would reverse Indonesia\u2019s long-standing position on China\u2019s nine-dash line in the South China Sea, or if it was simply a show of negligence from our side.\nA veteran Indonesian diplomat asked, \u201cCould this be interpreted as Indonesia recognizing China's nine-dash line and undermining its own sovereignty, or just going it alone?\u201d He continued, \u201cJoint development cooperation in the overlapping waters claimed by the two countries [makes it] seem like we are giving legitimacy to PRC maritime claims.\u201d\nA senior journalist deems that the Foreign Ministry\u2019s long-standing position on the South China Sea and Natuna waters must change in line with the vision of Prabowo, a former Army general.\n\u201cWatch out for more changes in long time foreign policy positions under Prabowo. Diplomats and military see things differently,\u201d he said in a WhatsApp group conversation.\nThe joint statement is called the \u201cJoint Statement Between the People's Republic of China and the Republic of Indonesia on Advancing the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership and the China-Indonesia Community with a Shared Future\u201d.\nOn point 9, the two leaders do not explicitly refer to the tensions between the two countries in the North Natuna waters. The 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) grants Indonesia the sovereign right to exploit resources in the waters as its exclusive economic zone (EEZ), but China claims that the area has been the fishing ground of its seafarers for thousands of years.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nAccording to the joint statement: \u201cBoth sides emphasized maritime cooperation as an important component of the comprehensive strategic cooperation between China and Indonesia.

(AFP/Patrick Semansky)\nT\nhis week the United States will be hosting an online \u201cSummit for Democracy\u201d, which is claimed to \u201cfocus on challenges and opportunities facing democracies\u201d and to \u201cdefend democracy and human rights at home and abroad\u201d.\nUnfortunately, it might turn out to be nothing but an attempt to divide the world into opposing political camps and advance the US\u2019 own strategic agenda with democracy as an excuse. If so, the meeting couldn\u2019t be further away from the spirit of democracy.\nChina firmly opposes the move by the US, one that is dominated by the Cold War mentality and which seeks to incite ideological confrontation and risks creating new dividing lines in the international community.\nWith this summit, the US seeks to empower itself to determine who is democratic and who is not based on its own liking and measure the merits of other countries\u2019 democracy with its own yardstick. This is, in fact, privatization and labeling of democracy and will make the \u201cSummit for Democracy\u201d itself undemocratic.\nThe world today is facing pressing global challenges such as an ongoing pandemic and climate change, and some countries, including the US, are troubled by a worsening democracy and many domestic problems. Under such circumstances, countries have every reason to prioritize the needs of the people, advocate unity and cooperation, and strive for development and progress.\nPerhaps the last thing a responsible major country should do is to turn a blind eye to its own problems and scapegoat others politically. Ironically, it is the people who have to pay the price at the end of the day.\nViewpoint\nEvery Thursday\nWhether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.\nView More Newsletter\nBy registering, you agree with\nThe Jakarta Post\n's\nPrivacy Policy\nSign Up\nThank You\nfor signing up our newsletter!\nPlease check your email for your newsletter subscription.\nView More Newsletter\nWhile upholding democracy at home, countries should also support greater democracy in international relations, uphold the UN-centered international system and the international order based on international law. Efforts are also urgently needed to practice true multilateralism and make global governance more inclusive. These are the shared aspirations of the international community and meet the trend of our times. Unfortunately, the upcoming summit in the US will in no way advance these goals, except for making itself a disruptive factor.\nChina believes that democracy means, in essence, that people are the masters of the country. Democracy is practiced to meet people\u2019s needs, bringing the people a decent and happy life and progress for the country and beyond.\nHaving seen a number of successful and failed cases of democracy worldwide, countries across the world must have come to realize one thing, that is, true democracy will only dawn when it is deeply rooted in a country and fits well with its own national conditions and stage of development.\nEfforts to mechanically copy the political systems and democratic models of others have never worked and never will. Neither do attempts to impose one\u2019s own political will on others.\nWhen it comes to China\u2019s case, the Chinese people have followed the political development path with Chinese characteristics and created the model of whole-process people\u2019s democracy. The people enjoy the right to democratic elections, decision-making, management and supervision in accordance with the law.\nAnd the fundamental principle of putting people at the center is well applied to every policy and measure that will affect people\u2019s daily lives. This specific model of democracy works well in China, as it has been proven to be capable of solving China\u2019s problems and thus greatly supported by the Chinese people.\nWhen it comes to the international arena, China proposes to forge a new type of international relations featuring mutual respect, fairness, justice and win-win cooperation, building a global community with a shared future for mankind and striving for greater democracy in international relations.\nUnfortunately, regarding the US, it has continued to claim that it is a \u201cbeacon of democracy\u201d and \u201cmodel of democracy\u201d over the years, despite the structural flaws and problematic practices of its democratic system. It is the American people who are paying the heavy price for its rampant racial discrimination, enlarging social divide and widening wealth gap at home.\nHowever, none of these have discouraged the US from interfering in other countries\u2019 internal affairs, waging war under the guise of \u201cdemocracy\u201d, lecturing others on democracy in a condescending manner and creating regional turbulence and humanitarian disasters.\nThe US hosting of the \u201cSummit for Democracy\u201d follows the same logic behind the formation of some new regional groupings, including the Quad and AUKUS. With these moves, one thing is for sure: the US is still deeply obsessed with the Cold War mentality.\nAmid attempts to provoke confrontation or division in the region and beyond, China will work with other countries in the world to champion mutual respect, promote win-win cooperation and pursue peaceful coexistence and shared prosperity of nations, regardless of differences in social systems, ideologies, histories, cultures and stages of development.\n&nbsp;***\nThe writer is the Chinese ambassador to ASEAN.\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nRelated Articles\nTrump says anyone investing $1 billion in US will receive expedited permits\nHow Syria rebels' stars aligned for Assad's ouster\nIndonesia should think twice about joining BRICS and OECD\nDevelopments of Indonesia\u2019s OECD accession journey\nIndonesia urges countries to halt economic activities with Israel\nRelated Article\nTrump says anyone investing $1 billion in US will receive expedited permits\nHow Syria rebels' stars aligned for Assad's ouster\nIndonesia should think twice about joining BRICS and OECD\nDevelopments of Indonesia\u2019s OECD accession journey\nIndonesia urges countries to halt economic activities with Israel\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nMore in Opinion\nView more\nAcademia\nThe bottom-up wave of democratic rejuvenation\nAcademia\nPolice brutality: Fundamental problems in the institution\nAcademia\nFree trade deals increase Indonesian imports more than exports\nHighlight\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEditorial\nNarrow margin\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nThe Latest\nView more\nPolitics\nGovt to make KPK sole graft-fighting agency\nEconomy\nRI identifies 29 potential nuclear power plant sites\nEconomy\nChinese authorities are considering a weaker yuan as Trump trade risks loom, sources say\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia commences evacuation of 37 citizens in Damascus\nTech\nUS finalizes $6.1 billion Micron chip-making subsidy\nArchipelago\nTwo foreign visitors killed in tree collapse in Monkey Forest\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEconomy\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources",

(Reuters/Soe Zeya Tun)\nT\nhe 22nd ASEAN-China Summit is to be held in Thailand on Sunday. Amid the profound and complex changes in the international and regional landscape, the following questions raise increasing attention in the East Asian community and beyond: How is the ASEAN-China relationship doing? What will the Summit do to ASEAN-China relationship and regional cooperation?\nA review of history unveils the extraordinary journey of cooperation and development between ASEAN and China since the establishment of our dialogue relationship 28 years ago and our strategic partnership 16 years ago. As Chinese President Xi Jinping pointed out in his congratulatory letter to the opening ceremony of the Year of ASEAN-China Media Exchanges last February, ASEAN-China relations have entered a new stage of all-round development.\nOur relationship is forging ahead on a clearer path and with ever-growing strategic mutual trust. Leaders of both sides have been charting the course, for instance, President Xi\u2019s proposal of building a closer-knit ASEAN-China community with a shared future.\nOur two sides enjoy frequent high-level bilateral visits. And a highlight moment came when leaders of all ASEAN countries and the ASEAN Secretariat attended the Second Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation last April. Their collective attendance spoke volume of our deep mutual trust at the highest official level.\nEconomic and trade cooperation between our two sides has grown steadily. When global economic growth slowed down and trade protectionism gained track in 2018, the ASEAN-China trade volume reached a record high of US$587.8 billion, a year-on-year increase of 14.1 percent. In the first half of 2019, ASEAN overtook the United States to become China\u2019s second-largest trading partner for the first time, and our trade volume of the whole year is expected to reach $600 billion.\nFriendly people-to-people exchanges are getting ever more prosperous. Last year saw a total of 57 million mutual visits and nearly 4,000 flights every week between our two sides. China is the largest source of tourists for ASEAN countries, and more people from ASEAN countries come to work or study in China.\nConcrete steps have also been taken by China and ASEAN countries to enhance trust and manage differences in the South China Sea.\n&nbsp;\nThe two sides will declare the year 2020 as the Year of ASEAN-China Digital Economic Cooperation.\n&nbsp;\nWe have been actively advancing the consultations on the Code of Conduct in the South China Sea (COC) and completed the first reading of the single draft text ahead of schedule.\nThis is the latest major progress in the COC consultations and an important step toward the vision to conclude the consultations in three years.\nASEAN and China are working closely on international affairs. We have been jointly moving forward the negotiations on the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (RCEP) \u2014 one of many efforts to uphold the rules-based multilateral trading system and oppose protectionism and unilateralism.\nWe stay true to our common values of openness, inclusiveness and mutual learning between civilizations. We step up communication to address hot spot issues and maintain regional peace and stability. We are also joining hands at the subregional level to advance Lancang-Mekong cooperation and the cooperation between China and the Brunei-Indonesia-Malaysia-Philippines \u2014 East ASEAN Growth Area.\nThe ASEAN-China Summit will contribute significantly to our strategic relationship, in the following five aspects in particular.\nFirst, greater synergy between our development plans will be created. The ASEAN-China Strategic Partnership Vision 2030 adopted at the ASEAN-China Summit last year unfolded a blueprint for the mid- and long-term development of our ties.\nUnder its guidance, both sides are making great strides in the synergy and cooperation of the Belt and Road Initiative and the Master Plan on ASEAN Connectivity 2025.\nSecond, new growth areas for cooperation will be cultivated. The two sides will declare the year 2020 as the Year of ASEAN-China Digital Economic Cooperation. It offers opportunities to expand cooperation in the emerging industries, such as the digital economy, e-commerce, smart cities and 5G. The two sides are exploring a blue economy partnership, with an aim to strengthening cooperation on marine environmental protection, scientific research, shipping and disaster relief. Cooperation in sustainable maritime development will also be a focus in the future.\nThird, the momentum of people-to-people exchanges will sustain. A strong ASEAN-China relationship boils down to closer people-to-people ties. The ASEAN-China Young Leaders Scholarship established months ago is a flagship project run by the two sides, with support from the newly established ASEAN-China Cooperation Fund Management Team in the ASEAN Secretariat.\nFourth, determination to maintain regional peace and stability will be cemented. This is the common aspiration and a shared responsibility of ASEAN and China. China and ASEAN countries are committed to the COC consultations and the formulation of regional maritime rules.\nFifth, commitment to uphold multilateralism will be strengthened. In a world of rising uncertainties, protectionism and unilateralism, regional hot-spot issues have brought unprecedented challenges to this region.\nChampioning multilateralism, openness, inclusiveness and win-win results is in the best interests of both ASEAN and China. Our two sides would make full use of the regional cooperation platforms to upgrade the free trade agreement protocol, conclude the RCEP negotiation as early as possible and facilitate free trade.\nToward an era of stronger cooperation, China is ready to work with ASEAN to develop an even-closer partnership of development, win-win results, innovation and mutual understanding and deliver more benefits to the peoples of both sides.\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nRelated Articles\nIndonesia should think twice about joining BRICS and OECD\nChina's Xi calls for more free trade\nBiden to meet Prabowo, Israeli president on Tuesday\nPresidential candidates set to spar on foreign, defense policies\nTop regional lender China struggling with development commitments, study finds\nRelated Article\nIndonesia should think twice about joining BRICS and OECD\nChina's Xi calls for more free trade\nBiden to meet Prabowo, Israeli president on Tuesday\nPresidential candidates set to spar on foreign, defense policies\nTop regional lender China struggling with development commitments, study finds\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nMore in Academia\nView more\nAcademia\nThe bottom-up wave of democratic rejuvenation\nAcademia\nPolice brutality: Fundamental problems in the institution\nAcademia\nFree trade deals increase Indonesian imports more than exports\nHighlight\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEditorial\nNarrow margin\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nThe Latest\nView more\nPolitics\nGovt to make KPK sole graft-fighting agency\nEconomy\nRI identifies 29 potential nuclear power plant sites\nEconomy\nChinese authorities are considering a weaker yuan as Trump trade risks loom, sources say\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia commences evacuation of 37 citizens in Damascus\nTech\nUS finalizes $6.1 billion Micron chip-making subsidy\nArchipelago\nTwo foreign visitors killed in tree collapse in Monkey Forest\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEconomy\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources",

(AFP/Jose Luis Magana)\nI\nn 1979, then United States secretary of state Cyrus Vance traveled to Indonesia to attend a meeting of ASEAN, which was formed just 12 years earlier. The historic meeting was the first of its kind, and it laid the foundation for the US-ASEAN Strategic Partnership that we enjoy today \u2013 a relationship central to the US approach to the region and our shared goals of peace and prosperity.\nBack then, few imagined the successes the coming decades would bring. Today, the US-ASEAN Strategic Partnership underscores our vitally important cooperation on everything from public health and human capital development to economic recovery and maritime security.\nAs we prepare for the US-ASEAN Summit and the East Asia Summit at the end of this month, it is important to remain focused on the tremendous strengths in the partnerships between the United States and countries in Southeast Asia.\nI am traveling in Southeast Asia this week to strengthen these partnerships across the board, and to work together with ASEAN nations to support a peaceful return to democracy in Myanmar. The international community must take bold action to address the deteriorating political, economic, and humanitarian crises in Myanmar and the threat they pose to regional stability.&nbsp;\nThe US applauds the principled stand of the ASEAN foreign ministers on Myanmar\u2019s representation at the upcoming ASEAN summit, in light of the lack of progress by the military regime on the ASEAN five-point consensus. As the military regime continues its campaign of violent repression, the US will join with the international community to press the military regime to return Myanmar to its democratic path, allow for unimpeded humanitarian access, release unjustly detained individuals, cease all violence, and implement the five-point consensus that ASEAN \u2014 and the regime itself \u2014 agreed to in April. That includes immediately allowing the ASEAN special envoy, Brunei\u2019s Foreign Minister Erywan Yusof, to visit Myanmar and meet with all stakeholders without conditions.\nBeyond addressing the crisis in Myanmar, America\u2019s goals in the region are clear: we seek a region stable, prosperous, and at peace, where freedom\u2014of the seas, of commerce, of each individual\u2014and a commitment to the rules-based, ASEAN-led regional order ensure that power is subject to law and stability and prosperity prevail for generations to come.\nTo advance these objectives, the US will continue to deepen our alliances and partnerships in Southeast Asia and work closely with ASEAN and its members to address the most pressing challenges facing the region.\nFirst, we are committed to reflecting the centrality of ASEAN and Southeast Asia in our diplomacy. We know that ASEAN plays a critical role in ensuring regional stability, including in the maritime domain, as well as economic opportunity, people-to-people connectivity, and the rules-based international order \u2013 and we recognize the importance of elevated engagement with ASEAN.\nAlready this year, Secretary of State Antony Blinken has attended five ASEAN-led ministerial meetings, and Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm convened the first-ever US-ASEAN energy ministerial. The Vice President, secretary of defense, US ambassador to the UN, and deputy secretary of state have traveled to Southeast Asia to consult with partners on critically important challenges and opportunities.&nbsp; The US will continue to support the ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific, and US strategy will similarly continue to reflect Southeast Asia\u2019s importance, and ASEAN\u2019s critical role in determining the region\u2019s future.\nThe US is further committed to reinforcing ASEAN centrality through innovative, results-oriented partnerships with allies and partners across the Indo-Pacific. Our five regional treaty alliances and this deep, growing network of bilateral and multilateral partnerships, including the Mekong-US Partnership, will help us advance our positive vision for the Indo-Pacific, for the collective benefit of all countries. The Quad, with its focus on climate, health, and technology, has demonstrated the benefits of such coordination \u2013 as just one example, the Quad vaccine initiative is enabling the production of one billion lifesaving COVID-19 vaccines.\nSecond, our top priority must be to stop the spread of COVID-19 by vaccinating as many people as possible in short order, while continuing to provide life-saving assistance for infected individuals. The US has made available more than US$200 million in assistance and 42 million vaccine doses in emergency health and humanitarian assistance to ASEAN member states to fight COVID-19. The US commends ASEAN\u2019s response to the COVID-19 pandemic and we will continue to support ASEAN\u2019s efforts to end this pandemic and prepare for the next.\nThird, our economic relations in Southeast Asia will remain critical. The flows of people, services, investment, and goods across the Indo-Pacific have connected our dynamic and growing markets for decades. Southeast Asian nations collectively represent the US\u2019 fourth largest trading partner and support over 600,000 U. jobs. We must continue to deepen these connections.\nFourth, climate change has wreaked havoc in the region. Tackling this threat with seriousness and urgency represents an opportunity to build more resilient economies and create millions of jobs, while protecting our national security and preserving our collective environmental inheritance. The US will continue to partner with ASEAN countries, and we hope ASEAN members will enhance their respective commitments and announce ambitious climate targets in the lead up to the UN climate conference (COP26) in Glasgow in November.\nWhen Vice President Harris visited Singapore in August, she expressed her hope that, decades from now, we look back on this moment as \u201cwhen our region joined together to realize a better future; when we took action to improve the lives of all people.\u201d\nWhat we can accomplish through the deep partnerships between our countries will determine whether we turn that inspiring hope into an enduring reality. We are committed to doing just that.&nbsp;\n&nbsp;***\nThe writer is counselor of the United States Department of State.\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nRelated Articles\nHow Syria rebels' stars aligned for Assad's ouster\nVietnam's soaring US trade surplus stokes new fears of tariffs\nIndonesia has not surrendered sovereign rights in the North Natuna Sea\nASEAN, Canada work together for health security\nTrump at 201 electoral votes, Harris at 91: US media\nRelated Article\nHow Syria rebels' stars aligned for Assad's ouster\nVietnam's soaring US trade surplus stokes new fears of tariffs\nIndonesia has not surrendered sovereign rights in the North Natuna Sea\nASEAN, Canada work together for health security\nTrump at 201 electoral votes, Harris at 91: US media\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nMore in Academia\nView more\nAcademia\nThe bottom-up wave of democratic rejuvenation\nAcademia\nPolice brutality: Fundamental problems in the institution\nAcademia\nFree trade deals increase Indonesian imports more than exports\nHighlight\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEditorial\nNarrow margin\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nThe Latest\nView more\nPolitics\nGovt to make KPK sole graft-fighting agency\nEconomy\nRI identifies 29 potential nuclear power plant sites\nEconomy\nChinese authorities are considering a weaker yuan as Trump trade risks loom, sources say\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia commences evacuation of 37 citizens in Damascus\nTech\nUS finalizes $6.1 billion Micron chip-making subsidy\nArchipelago\nTwo foreign visitors killed in tree collapse in Monkey Forest\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEconomy\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources",

Further efforts to exploit much the same feebleness are the primary factor why passengers can no longer take any more than tiny amounts of liquid on board flights and, in some parts of the world, are required to have their footwear searched before being permitted to enter the plane.\n&nbsp;Essentially, passengers withstand these strictures with a weary compliance, conforming to it and recognizing it as much a part of contemporary aviation as jetlag '\u0080\u0094 the price of remaining safe.\nAnd when the news that MH370 had gone missing first appeared, a large number of regular passengers, including myself, would have expected the flight'\u0080\u0099s progress to have been carefully tracked in order for the passengers to be accurately located. We would also have never doubted that no traveler would have got on board without having his or her identification verified and passport checked.\nAll this provides an explanation of why it was very disturbing to hear that little tracking was conducted, leaving the aviation investigation team to be dubious about whether the plane might have crashed in the South China Sea, the Gulf of Thailand, or even, as some predict, the Malacca Strait, creating a gigantic search area.\nThat response was aggravated by the recent stories that two of the travelers on board had Austrian and Italian passports that had been apparently stolen long before, but the validity of which were not verified during the routine check-in procedure in Kuala Lumpur.\nWhen all the questions surrounding MH370 are answered, many lessons need to be learnt to avoid repeating the same\nmistake.\nMuhammad Zulfikar Rakhmat\nDoha, Qatar\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nRelated Articles\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nFree trade deals increase Indonesian imports more than exports\nIndonesia\u2019s tourist sector: A new era of innovation and growth\nPresident Prabowo should make Indonesia a global champion of democracy\nNew mosque in Nusantara to replace Istiqlal as state mosque\nRelated Article\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nFree trade deals increase Indonesian imports more than exports\nIndonesia\u2019s tourist sector: A new era of innovation and growth\nPresident Prabowo should make Indonesia a global champion of democracy\nNew mosque in Nusantara to replace Istiqlal as state mosque\nPopular\nDiageo expands factory in Bali, strengthens Indonesia as Southeast Asia supply hub\nIndonesia mulling social media ban for children\nThree Chinese, Japanese firms set to build factory in Batang for exports\nMore in News\nView more\nOpinion\nAnalysis: Govt adopts mandatory B35 biodiesel program as CPO prices tumble\nBusiness\nGlobal chip crunch stunts Indonesia car sales recovery\nBusiness\nXL profit falls in Q3 as tower sale income dries\nHighlight\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEditorial\nNarrow margin\nPolitics\nPresident Prabowo touts biggest spending on education in state budget\nThe Latest\nView more\nPolitics\nGovt to make KPK sole graft-fighting agency\nEconomy\nRI identifies 29 potential nuclear power plant sites\nEconomy\nChinese authorities are considering a weaker yuan as Trump trade risks loom, sources say\nMiddle East and Africa\nIndonesia commences evacuation of 37 citizens in Damascus\nTech\nUS finalizes $6.1 billion Micron chip-making subsidy\nArchipelago\nTwo foreign visitors killed in tree collapse in Monkey Forest\nMarkets\nMinistry to curb nickel output to push up global prices\nEconomy\nBeijing considers weaker yuan as trade risks loom: Sources",
