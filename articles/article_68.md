The Kota Tua Creative Festival 2014 has given a sneak peek of what the Old Town (Kota Tua) could be if it was developed into the capital's creative hub.
Visitors and participants of the festival shared the same vision ' that the historic city be revived into a creative cultural center.
Your comments:
Kota Tua is a fine example of the bad management of an urban area. Property owners were encouraged to develop and utilize their property albeit the absence of decent urban facilities and infrastructure.
If the facilities provided were as good as those on Jl. MH Thamrin and Jl. Sudirman (good access, security, cleanliness, adequate and safe parking, etc.), I am sure property owners and investors would rush to develop their properties.
Maybe the management of the area should be put in contact with the property management company that manages urban developments such as the Sudirman Central Business District, the Taman Rasuna super block, or private/ community institutions, without the intervention of agencies that today run Kota Tua.
It works in Kuta, Bali and in New York, the US.
