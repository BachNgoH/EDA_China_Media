his is a comment on an article titled 'Indonesia should withdraw from the ICSID,' (The Jakarta Post, April 2) by Hikmahanto Juwana, Jakarta.
&nbsp;Various countries are now reconsidering their major potential liabilities at the International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) and elsewhere due to investment treaties that were not properly evaluated at the time and that have been abused, frankly, by some investors and lawyers.
Indonesia's government should be applauded for taking this responsible approach.
There are other ways to encourage foreign investment, such as by asking foreign investors what they want and adapting domestic legislation and policy accordingly.
By withdrawing from the ICSID, the Indonesian government could remove its liability under investment treaties that remain in place due to onerous survival clauses, which allow claims only under the ICSID rules.
