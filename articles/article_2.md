hina-ASEAN dialogue relations were established in 1991. The past 30 years, though a short stretch of history, have been a glorious chapter highlighted by mutual friendship and cooperation.
Evolving from a dialogue partnership to a strategic partnership, China and ASEAN are about to embrace a comprehensive strategic partnership that is already the most dynamic, substantive and influential in the entire region.
Over the past three decades, China and ASEAN have deepened strategic mutual trust and enhanced good neighborliness. Leaders of the two sides have maintained close communication through multiple means. In recent years, Chinese President Xi Jinping has visited the 10 ASEAN member states and has met with leaders of ASEAN countries many times, steering the course of China-ASEAN relations.
Strategic communication on major issues between the two sides has been conducted in a timely manner through the multi-level dialogue mechanism, including between top leaders, ministers and senior officials.
With our shared commitment to multilateralism, China and ASEAN jointly uphold the ASEAN-centered regional architecture that is open and inclusive. Together, we have safeguarded regional peace and stability and properly managed our differences on the South China Sea issue through dialogue and consultation.
Over the past 30 years, China and ASEAN have offered each other much-needed support in trying times. The two have worked in concert to tide over one crisis after another, such as the 1997 Asian financial crisis, the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome outbreak, the 2004 bird flu epidemic and the 2008 global financial crisis.
