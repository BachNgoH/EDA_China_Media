T
he government expects the Jakarta-Bandung high-speed railway project to face another setback as a result of geographical and geological obstacles hampering its construction.
President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo said on Monday that the railway would enter operation by the end of June 2023, half a year later than the previous target of December this year.
This is the latest in a series of delays to a project that was initially meant to be completed by the end of 2018.
“As per this date, the whole Jakarta-Bandung high-speed railway has reached 79.9 percent of completion. We expect testing [to begin] by the end of 2022 and operations by [the end of] June 2023,” Jokowi said during his visit to the site.

The delay also adds to the cost overrun on the project, which will weigh on the state budget, since Presidential Regulation No. 93/2021 issued last year allows the government to finance the project or provide guarantees for more loans.

In September last year, the State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) Ministry estimated that the project had overrun its budget by Rp 27.17 trillion (US$1.9 billion) to Rp 113.9 trillion as a result of land-acquisition problems, overoptimistic planning and poor project management.
