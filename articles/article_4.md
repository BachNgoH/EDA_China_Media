Time rolls on just like the flow of water. On Feb. 22, 2022, I came to the “nation of archipelago” as the Chinese ambassador to Indonesia on a glorious mission entrusted by my government. In the blink of an eye, the time has come for me to bid farewell.
In the past two years, I traveled around Java, and set foot on the islands of Sumatra, Kalimantan, Sulawesi, Bali and West and East Nusa Tenggara. From the sapphire-blue sky and sea of Bali to the emerald-green mountain and water of Lake Toba, from the Komodo dragon to the orangutan, from the Mahayana reliefs of Borobudur to the statue of Zheng He in Semarang, I have been deeply impressed by Indonesia’s wonderful scenery, diverse and inclusive culture, kind-hearted and hospitable people and vibrant society.
The past two years have been rewarding. Together with Indonesian friends from all walks of life, I have made efforts to implement the important consensus reached by Chinese and Indonesian leaders to deepen cooperation in development strategy, promote practical cooperation and expand exchanges and mutual learning.
China-Indonesia relations have made great strides forward, delivering fruitful outcomes from this cooperation. Both important developing countries and emerging economies, our two countries share similar goals, uphold mutual respect and strive for mutual benefit from each other’s comparative strengths.
We work hand in hand on the path toward modernization and bring tangible benefits to our two peoples. The giant ship of the China-Indonesia community with a shared future is setting sail for a new journey.

I am pleased to see that under the strategic guidance of our two presidents, China-Indonesia relations are at a historical high. In the past two years, President Xi Jinping made the first overseas visit to Indonesia after the 20th Communist Party of China (CPC) National Congress. President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo visited China three times. President-elect
Prabowo Subianto
made his first visit to China soon after the election.
I am pleased to see that our two presidents have charted the course of jointly building the China-Indonesia community with a shared future, and reached a new important consensus on turning the vision into a reality. Our two sides make full use of high-level dialogue and cooperation mechanism to promote practical cooperation in all areas. The 2+2 ministerial dialogue mechanism is in place and will set to inject new momentum into our Comprehensive Strategic Partnership.
I am pleased to see that our two countries have become the pacesetters of successful Belt and Road cooperation based on the principle of designing together, building together and benefiting together. The Jakarta-Bandung High-Speed Rail (Whoosh) makes Indonesia the only country besides China to have a 350-kilometer/hour railway.
Whoosh not only shortens the&nbsp;travel time, but also helps upgrade the industrial structure and empower economic development along the route. The Regional Comprehensive Economic Corridor and the “Two Countries, Twin Parks” move forward steadily and are expected to become new flagship projects of our Belt and Road cooperation.
I am pleased to see that our two-way trade is over US$100 billion every year. China has been Indonesia’s largest trading partner for 11 consecutive years and among Indonesia’s top three sources of foreign investment for eight years in a row. Our industrial and supply chain cooperation develops by leaps and bounds, a success for both sides.
I am pleased to see the increasing number of flights and people-to-people exchanges between the two countries in the post-COVID era. Indonesian students return to campus in China. The performance of the folk music ensemble and Xinjiang art troupe from China amazed Indonesian friends. Delegations of Indonesian religious communities paid visits to China. Chinese language training courses are now open in Istiqlal Mosque.
The China-Indonesia joint scientific expedition set Indonesia’s deepest dive record. Indonesia is one of the first destinations for China to resume outbound group tours after the pandemic. In 2023, 707,000 Chinese tourists came to Indonesia to enjoy sea views, volcano trekking and delicious food.
I am pleased to see that our two countries work together closely on international and regional issues with similar positions. In the past two years, Indonesia successfully hosted the Group of 20 Bali Summit and Leaders’ Meetings on East Asia Cooperation as the chair of the G20 and ASEAN. China fully supported Indonesia in fulfilling its duties. China appreciates Indonesia’s support for the Global Development Initiative and its positive response to the Global Security Initiative and Global Civilization Initiative, and is ready to work with Indonesia to take the initiatives forward.
Changes in the world, of our times and of historical significance are unfolding like never before, and the world has entered a new period of turbulence and transformation. Yet the overall direction of human development and progress will not change, the overall dynamics of world history moving forward amid twists and turns will not change and the overall trend toward a shared future for the international community will not change.
As long as China and Indonesia focus on building the community with a shared future, continue to promote high-quality Belt and Road cooperation, call for an equal and orderly multi-polar world and universally beneficial and inclusive economic globalization, respond to global challenges together and strive to achieve common prosperity, the bilateral relations will surely get better day by day. Our respective development goals will surely be achieved and we will surely have an even brighter future.
As an Indonesian proverb goes, “Money is easy to get, but friends are hard to find.” I am glad that in the past two years, I have had the opportunity to get to know friends from the Indonesian government, political parties, parliament, business, religious and overseas Chinese communities, think tanks and media, other diplomatic missions in Indonesia and Chinese entrepreneurs, press and teachers. Thank you all for your valuable contributions to China-Indonesia relations and strong support for the work of the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia, and myself in particular.
Words are never enough for bidding farewell. I will start a new journey with beautiful memories and deep friendships from Indonesia. And I will continue to follow the development of China-Indonesia relations and be an envoy of friendship between our two countries.
May China and Indonesia enjoy prosperity and the people’s happiness. May China-Indonesia relations reach greater heights. May all our Indonesian friends enjoy good health.
