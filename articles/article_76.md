ndonesia and China on Tuesday celebrated the strengthening of bilateral ties between the two countries, especially in the period since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, which broke out in the Chinese city of Wuhan in the late 2019.
The outgoing Chinese Ambassador to Indonesia Xiao Qian said the two countries had taken the bilateral relations to a new height thanks to numerous joint efforts to deal with the ongoing pandemic.
"Since the pandemic began [...] China and Indonesia have helped each other to jointly overcome difficulties, focused on fighting the pandemic and have sought common development, and upgraded bilateral relations against all odds," said Xiao, who is expected to vacate his post in November after serving since December 2017.
Xiao said the fact that President Xi Jinping and President Joko "Jokowi" Widodo had spoken four times in the past four years was an indication of a strong relationship between the two countries.
Xiao, who spoke during the 72nd anniversary celebration of the founding of the People's Republic of China, also pointed to China's contribution to providing COVID-19 vaccines as part of his country's long-term commitment to Indonesia.
Data from the Chinese Embassy show that Sinovac and Sinopharm have exported 215 million doses of vaccines to Indonesia, making up about 20 percent of China’s exports in the past one year, and accounting for over 80 percent of Indonesia’s vaccine imports.
The ambassador also pointed out that trade between Indonesia and China had in fact grown during the pandemic.
In the first half of 2021, bilateral trade amounted to US$53.57 billion, a year-on-year increase of 50.7 percent while Indonesia’s exports to China were worth $26.28 billion US dollars, a year-on-year increase of 52 percent.
China’s direct investment in Indonesia reached $111 million, an increase of 17.4 percent compared with the same period last year, data from the embassy show.
With regard to ASEAN, Xiao said that China had a long-term commitment to the region.
"China is willing to work with ASEAN to focus on the next 30 years to jointly realize, maintain and develop a road of regional cooperation with East Asian characteristics, build a higher level of China-ASEAN strategic partnership, and build a closer community with a shared future," he said.
Xiao's remarks came as new tension emerged in the region following the decision by the United States, United Kingdom and Australia to sign a security pact, known as AUKUS, that would allow Australia to build a nuclear submarine fleet.
Indonesia and Malaysia have expressed concern about the pact saying that it could spark an arms race in the region. The Philippines on the other hand has thrown its weight behind the new plan.
On Tuesday, Wang Yi said the AUKUS security pact brought hidden dangers to regional peace, stability and the international order.
Wang made the comments as he cochaired the latest round of the high-level strategic dialogue between China and the European Union alongside EU foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell, according to a statement from the Chinese foreign ministry, Reuters reported.
Coordinating Maritime Affairs and Investment Minister Luhut Pandjaitan meanwhile called for deeper cooperation between the two countries, which he described as "resilient", especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.
"The dynamics of the international situation nowadays have created multifaceted challenges that require stronger cooperation [...] The cooperation in mitigating the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is a testament to that resilience," Luhut said in his speech during the same event.
Luhut also said that China and Indonesia could take the current relationship to a new height especially next year when Indonesia took over as chair of the Group of 20 leading economies.
The senior minister expected that President Xi could join the summit in person in Bali and take a tour around the country to see the progress in some of the infrastructure projects that are part of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).
"Next year when Indonesia holds the presidency of the G20, President Xi will be able to witness the implementation of several of our strategic projects. These projects started in 2014 when President Joko Widodo proposed his vision of a global maritime fulcrum, which relates profoundly to the concept of the Belt and Road Initiative, designed by China in 2013," Luhut said.
