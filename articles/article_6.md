China-ASEAN Expo and China-ASEAN Business and Investment Summit were recently held in Nanning, Guangxi province, China. President Xi Jinping, President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo and other leaders of ASEAN countries delivered speeches at the opening ceremony, saying they looked forward to the bright future of China-ASEAN relations.
China and ASEAN countries, connected by the same mountains and rivers, are inseparable neighbors. In recent years, China and ASEAN enjoy deepening mutual trust, growing connectivity, robust business ties and closer people-to-people exchanges.
The China-ASEAN relationship has grown into the most successful and vibrant model for cooperation in the Asia-Pacific and an exemplary effort in building a community with a shared future for mankind.
Since the start of COVID-19, China and ASEAN countries have taken the lead in conducting regional antiepidemic cooperation. We have actively shared our experience in COVID-19 response, ensured medical supplies, conducted joint research and development of vaccines, and kept the regional industrial and supply chains stable. We are at the forefront of global cooperation on pandemic response and economic recovery.
Despite the severe global economic recession and sharp decline in trade, bilateral trade and investment between China and ASEAN continue to rise this year. In the first three quarters, China-ASEAN trade reached US$481.81 billion, up by 5 percent year-on-year, making ASEAN China’s largest trading partner.
China’s industry-wide foreign direct investment in ASEAN topped $10.72 billion, jumping 76.6 percent year-on-year. These figures speak volumes about the strong foundation and potential of our cooperation.
Indonesia is the largest country in ASEAN. The development of China-Indonesia relations has played an important leading role in China-ASEAN relations. Since the start of the COVID-19, our two countries have worked together to overcome difficulties and achieved growth in bilateral relations despite the pandemic.
President Xi and President Jokowi exchanged three phone calls, charting the course for bilateral cooperation on pandemic response and economic recovery. Signature cooperation projects such as the Jakarta-Bandung high-speed railway and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Corridors are making steady progress. Our two governments and peoples have supported each other to fight the pandemic.
As of now, enterprises from both countries are pushing ahead with cooperation on vaccine research and development, production and technological transfer, which will make Indonesia among the first countries to gain access to a COVID-19 vaccine and become a regional vaccine production center.
From January to September this year, China remained Indonesia’s largest trading partner and second-largest investor. China’s imports from Indonesia has increased by 6.3 percent and investment to Indonesia grew by 79 percent.
At the end of last month, our two countries successfully held the China-Indonesia Coal Procurement Matchmaking Meeting where companies of both countries reached procurement agreements worth $1.467 billion. These fully demonstrate the great vitality and huge potential of China-Indonesia relations.
This year marks the 70
th
anniversary of diplomatic relations between China and Indonesia, and next year marks the 30
th
anniversary of China-ASEAN dialogue relations.
Looking back, the development of China-Indonesia relations and China-ASEAN relations have made positive contribution to peace, stability and prosperity in the region and beyond. Looking to the future, our relations stand at a new historical starting point, ushering in the bright prospect of building a community with a shared future.
Together we should cherish the hard-won achievements and seize the historical opportunities in front of us. We welcome friendly exchanges and cooperation between respective countries and others.
Yet we should also be vigilant against any attempt to disrupt China’s ties with Indonesia and other ASEAN countries. China stands ready to continue working with Indonesia and other ASEAN countries to advance cooperation on pandemic response and economic recovery, resist any external interference, jointly maintain regional peace and stability, and work together to build a closer China-ASEAN community with a shared future.
