O
n Sunday Indonesia convened the 23
rd
ASEAN Economic Community Council, laying a historic pathway to empower Southeast Asia to emerge as Asia's center of gravity and a global economic powerhouse.
The council celebrated remarkable achievements. Our region is stable and prosperous, realizing significant economic transformation, achieving an impressive average growth rate of 5 percent, and effective in responding to external shocks.
Indeed, we are making sound policy choices for the well-being of our people and a brighter future.
While our region is dynamic, member states now find themselves navigating a complex external landscape and multiple drivers of change. Policymakers all over the world are grappling with measures to address structural shifts, including technological advancement, demographic changes and sustainability, as well as geoeconomic and geopolitical forces shaking up the rules-based global order.
The council recognized that the trajectory of our region is not immune to the trials of a more complex and uncertain global context.
We resolved to work together to tackle challenges and harness opportunities for economic growth and resilience. Ministers shared diverse perspectives on member state priorities and differing pathways, yet we will continue building on ASEAN’s strengths of being committed to consensus among member states, working together toward common goals and ensuring no one is left behind.

We recommitted to the ASEAN founding principles of unity and solidarity.
To benefit our people, communities and businesses, ASEAN is delivering a comprehensive forward-looking strategy for economic transformation, connectivity and sustainability.
In Jakarta on Sunday, as chair of the council, I was delighted by the progress made this year on the 2023 Priority Economic Deliverables.
ASEAN launched a new digital economy framework agreement for strengthening the digital ecosystem and enabling ASEAN businesses to thrive. This is an enormous opportunity as our market is projected to double to US$2 trillion by 2030.
The council endorsed working toward carbon neutrality, including growing industries in the green, blue and circular economy. We are working on positioning the region as a global electric vehicle production hub and enhancing environmental management.
Plus, in response to the global crisis, we advanced strengthening food security and nutrition.
Deepening regional and global market integration, and strengthening efforts toward a single, seamless market by 2045, continue to be our overarching focus. To this end, we are investing in education, skills and healthy innovation systems, removing non-tariff barriers to trade, and promoting cross-border technology-led investment.
This will enable our industries and businesses to be more integrated and make higher value-added contributions to global value chains. By doing so, we can boost incomes and revenues throughout the region, and achieve our goal of becoming highly competitive, with equitable, cohesive and resilient economic development.
As we near the end of the ASEAN 2025 Blueprint, the council emphasized that we can no longer continue with business as usual. To strengthen competitiveness and productivity, member states need to accelerate the pace and scale of domestic policy reform.
Our community must work harder to close the development gaps between member states and sub-national regions so that we move forward together. Furthermore, we are determined to work diligently to ensure our cooperation modalities are fit for purpose and that we have the necessary tools to future-proof our region.
We are now charting a path to develop the ASEAN Post-2025 Vision, which will guide the region's economic development for decades to come. With the global trade system at a standstill and concerns about de-risking value chains, ASEAN will explore new approaches.
We must continue strengthening our trade architecture, not only to increase our resilience but to reinforce more inclusive globalization.
It is crucial to have a strong and united ASEAN Economic Community for the stability and prosperity of our region in the long term.
As we move forward together, we should strive to protect our traditional strengths while adapting to the changing strategic landscape. ASEAN centrality and connectivity are essential, especially for safeguarding the region’s strategic independence.
I am confident that ASEAN is transforming into a global engine of growth, which reflects Indonesia’s chairing theme “ASEAN Matters: Epicentrum of Growth”.
However, we must take proactive measures to shape a future where Southeast Asia is recognized for its agility, innovation, people-centred approach and ability to deliver inclusive and sustainable economic growth while maintaining resilience.
