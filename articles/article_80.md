The recent presidential debate, centered around the Indonesia’s position in international affairs, may not have captivated the public, who often prioritize issues like the economy and corruption. However, the candidates' views on foreign policy offer a profound insight into their broader vision for Indonesia's role on the world stage.
Worldviews in international relations typically fall within two major spectra: Hobbesian and Grotian. The Hobbesian perspective, rooted in realism, perceives the state position at the global level through the lenses of military and economic might. It is a self-help system where states prioritize their own survival and interests, measuring their influence by material capabilities.
For middle powers, this translates into an influence shaped by military strength and economic resources in an environment rife with inevitable conflict. This also implies an influence directly proportional to their military prowess and economic clout.
In such a competitive arena, a middle power like Indonesia is compelled to continuously expand its economic and military capabilities. This relentless pursuit of growth and strength is perceived as the only route for a middle power to garner respect and assert its presence internationally.
Contrastingly, the Grotian perspective emphasizes legal norms and institutions. It highlights how the state can wield significant influence beyond mere material power. This approach underscores the power of diplomatic engagement, coalition-building and active participation in shaping international norms and leading initiatives in human rights and environmental stewardship.
Power here is not just about material capabilities but also the capacity to shape ideas and lead in the global community. For a middle power, this means actively engaging in regional and global agenda-setting, becoming a norm entrepreneur and fostering solidarity that resonates with other nations. In this context, the power of ideas and diplomatic finesse is deemed crucial for gaining respect and influence at the global level.
Presidential candidate
Anies Baswedan
aligns with the Grotian worldview. His approach to power is multifaceted, extending beyond traditional domains to include cultural influence. He champions the concept of soft power, where influence is exerted through cultural appeal, political values and foreign policy.
