est Java Governor Ridwal Kamil will summon representatives from PT Kereta Cepat Indonesia China (KCIC) and other related parties in charge of the Jakarta-Bandung high-speed railway project following a construction mishap that led to a fatal explosion from an underground oil pipe belonging to state-owned energy company Pertamina near a toll road in Bandung, West Java, last week.
The governor will also discuss other cases of environmental risks and hazards in several regions that were allegedly caused by the high-speed railway project, including noticeable cracks within the walls of a local residence near the construction site in Laksana Mekar village, Padalarang district, West Bandung.
“I demand professionalism and strict adherence to the standard operating procedures. I’m aware it’s a highly anticipated project, but please complete it in an orderly and safe fashion so as to not disrupt the lives of local residents,” Ridwan said.
“I’ve recapitulated the number of reported cases and summoned several regional heads to discuss their problems [related to the high-speed railway construction]. Among the affected regions are Cimahi, Bandung, West Bandung and Purwakarta regency.”
The high-speed railway project is one of the government's national strategic projects in the transportation sector, constructed with Chinese assistance and a total investment of US$6.07 billion. The railway will travel at 350 kilometers per hour, cutting travel time between Jakarta and Bandung in West Java to 45 minutes, faster than the three and half hours on a normal train.
Land procurement for the project has neared 100 percent completion, with an overall development progress of 30 percent.
“We move forward with the project. Accidents happen from time to time, but I’m making sure they don’t occur [frequently],” Ridwan said, adding that he expected the high-speed train to commence operations by the first semester of 2021.
