T
he Chinese foreign ministry said in a statement published earlier this week that it congratulated Indonesia on its&nbsp;successful Feb. 14 elections and respected the poll outcome.
Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said that China "believes&nbsp;that the choice of the Indonesian people is in the interests&nbsp;of their country’s future and prosperity."
The spokesperson, responding to a question from Antara state news agency, also said that it would continue working to build a good relationship with whoever was elected to&nbsp;the country's presidency.
"China looks to continue to work with Indonesia to stick to the main theme of building a community with a shared future, forging&nbsp;high-level strategic mutual trust, and deepening&nbsp;strategic cooperation across the board," Mao said in the statement.
Late last week, Chinese Ambassador to Indonesia Lu Gang visited Defense Minister
Prabowo Subianto
at his private residence in South Jakarta to congratulate the former general on his apparent&nbsp;win in the 2024 presidential election.
The ambassador held the meeting with Prabowo on Sunday at the latter’s&nbsp;private residence on Jl. Kertanegara in an upmarket district of&nbsp;South Jakarta.
Earlier last week, the United States&nbsp;State Department issued a statement congratulating the Indonesian people for having conducted the Feb. 14 general election.
"We congratulate the Indonesian people for their robust turnout in today’s election," State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said.
Miller added that the election&nbsp;was a testament to the durability and strength of the Indonesian people’s commitment to the democratic process and electoral institutions.&nbsp;
"We look forward to the General Election Commission’s announcement of the official election results," he said.
