A success story: #BantuSekolahYuk with the ReachOut Foundation
The #BantuSekolahYuk project, in collaboration with the ReachOut Foundation, aimed to improve facilities and teaching methods in 30 early childhood centers (PAUD) in Jakarta. It raised Rp 210 million to meet educational needs, with the 10 centers gathering the most supporters receiving additional renovation support and curriculum training grants.
Zuriah, head of PAUD Ibnu Sabil in North Jakarta, shared her gratitude, "I never imagined a digital campaign could make such a profound impact. Our students now enjoy a more comfortable and conducive learning environment."
Tulus Siahaan, Operations Director ReachOut Foundation, also praised the collaboration's tangible outcomes, "We are thrilled that Campaign’s support effectively advanced our educational mission. Selecting the right partners is essential for impactful social change."
