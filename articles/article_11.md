Ahead of BRI anniversary, China unveils white paper on global cooperation
China has unveiled a white paper that builds on President Xi's vision of "a global community with a shared future" introduced a decade ago, which critics say is intended to coincide with the 10th anniversary of Beijing's so-called belt and road global infrastructure strategy.

, the white paper is available in eight languages and was released late last month by Foreign Minister Wang Yi.
“I hope that the release of the white paper can help people from all walks of life and the international community to get more comprehensive understanding on the far-reaching significance of a community with a shared future for mankind and gain a clearer understanding of the grand goals of major-country diplomacy with Chinese characteristics,” Wang told the launch event.
Ten years ago, Chinese President Xi Jinping introduced the concept of a global community with a shared future, devised as Beijing’s contribution to addressing the world’s challenges and creating prosperity for all.
“Over the past decade, the diplomatic practice of building a community with a shared future for mankind has yielded fruitful results. From bilateral to multilateral, from regional to global, China has built different forms of communities with a shared future with dozens of countries and regions,” said Wang.
“The global development initiative and the global security initiative have received clear support from more than 100 countries,” he added.
Wang also said China’s recently launched white paper could also help the world navigate the current geopolitical turbulence, especially as competition had become increasingly fierce with the return of a “Cold War mentality”, in addition to a rise in nontraditional security challenges such as terrorism, cyberattacks, transnational crimes and biosecurity.
