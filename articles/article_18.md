T
wenty-eight years ago, the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum came into being. Ever since, APEC has been growing vigorously, living up to the role as the region’s premier economic forum.
In a globalized and changing world and a dynamically growing Asia-Pacific, APEC is facing both new opportunities and challenges.
As the host of APEC 2017, it is Vietnam’s mandate to work with other member economies to transform the APEC leader’s commitments into tangible results and bring APEC closer to the people and the business community, thereby realizing the strategic vision for an Asia Pacific of sustainable and inclusive development in the 21st century.
The course of economic growth and integration in the Asia Pacific is being presented with opportunities thanks to deepened globalization, the Fourth Industrial Revolution, particularly digital technology, artificial intelligence, the internet of things, etc.
The increasing interdependence and connectivity in the region as well as the need to address global challenges also open up new opportunities for member economies to foster cooperation and integration.
While global and regional economic recovery is firming, given the international economic integration slowdown, mid-term risks, rising protectionism, the increasing rich-poor gap and traditional and non- traditional security challenges, the environment for regional security and development has become ever more uncertain and unpredictable.
Against that backdrop and on the basis of cooperation characterized by consensus, volunteerism, mutual benefit and mutual respect, the APEC Economic Leaders’ Meeting in Danang, a beautiful, modern, dynamic and hospitable coastal city, has an important mission in creating a new dynamism for APEC cooperation, integration and growth.
