ustralia has been able to stop an "incursion" by Beijing into the Pacific islands by talking with leaders there weekly and offering vaccine aid, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Sunday.
Concern over China's military ambitions for the region, after it provided police and riot equipment to the Solomon Islands, prompted United States Secretary of State Antony Blinken to last month announce Washington would open a Solomon Islands embassy.&nbsp;
Morrison said China had been "very clear" about aspirations to build a military base in the Pacific islands, but this had not occurred.
This was because Australia worked closely with the region, including providing COVID-19 vaccines before others could offer support, he said in a TV interview with Nine's Weekend Today.
"I talk to Pacific leaders every single week and that is what ensures that we can block the incursion into our region, because we share values with the Pacific," he said.
Australia is historically the largest aid donor to the Pacific islands, although China has increased infrastructure lending and aid, and provided military equipment to regional hub Fiji.&nbsp;
Beijing has previously said Australia and the US are "resurrecting a Cold War mentality", while China's assistance would "build a community with a shared future for China and Pacific island countries."
Tensions between Australia and China, who are significant trading partners, have risen as Beijing sanctioned Australian products in reprisal for Canberra calling for an investigation into the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Morrison, who faces an election in May, has put his government's tough rhetoric on China at the forefront of his campaign for reelection.&nbsp;
‘Establish primacy’
Last week, Australia's intelligence chief said that a "troubling new strategic convergence" between Beijing and Moscow has developed and the risk of "major power conflict" had grown since Russia invaded Ukraine.
Andrew Shearer, director general of Australia’s Office of National Intelligence, said China's President Xi Jinping appeared to be planning to dominate the Indo-Pacific region and use it as a base to overtake the US as the world's leading power.
The comments reinforce warnings that the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which has met near-universal condemnation by the West, may spread into a regional or global conflict.&nbsp;
"We're going to have to work much harder to maintain the liberal quality of the rules-based order in Europe and here in the Indo-Pacific region," Shearer said at a conference hosted by the Australian Financial Review on Wednesday.
"We see a leader who's really battening down and hardening his country for this struggle to overtake the US as the world's leading power," he added, referring to Xi.
"The base camp ... is to establish primacy in the Indo-Pacific region."
Shearer said the geopolitical threat would center around technology, including the use of cyber attacks, so Australia must bolster its cyber defenses without closing itself to trade and information-sharing.
"We need a growing, open economy so we can fund the increases in defence spending that the government's committed to, but this can't be a zero sum trade-off between economics and security," he said.
Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which it has called a "special operation", Australian intelligence professionals considered that "a major power conflict unfortunately is becoming a less remote prospect than it was previously", Shearer said.
He echoed many Western commentators by saying he was surprised by the effectiveness of Ukraine's resistance to Russian forces. But he foreshadowed a "brutal, bloody couple of weeks" since Russian leader Vladimir Putin had "everything at stake now [and] it's hard to see an elegant, or inelegant, dismount".
The Kremlin describes its actions as a "special operation" to disarm Ukraine and unseat leaders it calls neo-Nazis. Ukraine and Western allies call this a baseless pretext for a war of choice that has raised fears of wider conflict in Europe.
