The Food and Drug Monitoring Agency (BPOM) confiscated thousands of illegal drugs and cosmetics worth Rp 31.66 billion (US$2.6 million) after conducting raids across the archipelago from June to August.
BPOM head Roy Sparingga said that the raids, entitled Operation Storm, found 3,556 illegal items, consisting of 173 drug products (4.7 percent), as well as 1,520 traditional drugs (41.6 percent) and 1,963 cosmetic products (53.7 percent).
Your comments:
I think this country has a big problem with illegal goods. The BPOM has the preeminent job in controlling it, but the reality is drugs aren't controlled well. The BPOM must engage in cooperation with other agencies like the police and organizations like the Indonesian Pharmacy Organization because Indonesia is too large to be handled only by the BPOM.

We should appreciate what the BPOM has done. They should continue such operations in order to clear the market from these illegal products, especially traditional medicines, the fact is the BPOM found a lot of jamu (traditional medicines) that contain chemicals.
It's a good step for the BPOM to confiscate all the illegal products. Moreover, we hope that the government will also take action to stop the factories that produce illegal medicines.

The government should act harder against illegal factories, Consumers are in danger from illegal cosmetics and medicines.
