Russian President Vladimir Putin speaks with Chinese President Xi Jinping before an extended-format meeting of heads of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit (SCO) member states in Samarkand, Uzbekistan Sept. 16, 2022.  (Reuters/Pool/Sputnik/Sergey Bobylev)

ecently, the 22nd Meeting of the Council of Heads of State of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) was successfully held in Samarkand, Uzbekistan, where Chinese President Xi Jinping, together with leaders of other SCO member states, reviewed achievements, summarized experience, and drew new blueprints. During this period, openness and inclusiveness were the frequently mentioned keywords.
Openness and inclusiveness have contributed to the vigorous development of the SCO. Founded over 20 years ago, SCO member states have always upheld the Shanghai Spirit featuring mutual trust, mutual benefit, equality, consultation, respect for the diversity of civilizations and pursuit of common development, committed to political trust, mutually beneficial cooperation, equality, openness and inclusiveness, and equity and justice, and promoted “dialogue and cooperation in an interconnected world” as Uzbek President Shavkat Mirziyoyev wrote in his op-ed recently published in
The Jakarta Post.
The SCO member states, with their diverse national conditions and cultures, have been able to stay together and attract the attention and the application for joining of more like-minded countries because of their adherence to open and inclusive multilateralism. This is the important foundation for the SCO’s development and growth.
Openness and inclusiveness are also the secrets of successful East Asia cooperation. Since the establishment of the East Asia regional cooperation mechanism, all parties have made remarkable development achievements by adhering to the vision of peace, development, independence and inclusiveness, and upholding open regionalism.
ASEAN countries have created and led the East Asia regional cooperation mechanism, and also promoted the formation of the ASEAN development philosophy and ways of interaction featuring a development-first approach, mutually beneficial cooperation and mutual respect.
China has always supported ASEAN’s community building, supported the ASEAN-centered regional cooperation architecture. Last year, China and ASEAN established the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership. With the concerted efforts of the two sides to build a peaceful, safe and secure, prosperous, beautiful and amicable home together, China-ASEAN cooperation will certainly continue to be at the forefront of the times and offer strong guidance to East Asia cooperation.

China will always uphold the spirit of openness and inclusiveness in regional and international cooperation. As an advocate, a participant, and a beneficiary of global development cooperation, China will always pursue an opening-up strategy of win-win cooperation, and actively participate in regional and global cooperation. In response to the common and urgent issues of development and security faced by the international community,
China has proposed the Global Development Initiative and the Global Security Initiative, calling on all countries to stay true to the vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security and build a balanced, effective and sustainable security architecture, and also calling on all parties to foster global development partnership, and achieve more robust, greener and more balanced global development, thus effectively promoting international cooperation and addressing common challenges.
China is willing to take the implementation of relevant initiatives as an opportunity to deepen solidarity and cooperation with ASEAN and other relevant parties, practice multilateralism with a clear attitude and firm actions, and promote the building of a community with a shared future for mankind.
Seclusion and isolation will only lead to rigidity and backwardness, while inclusiveness and openness will bring mutual benefit and win-win results. In order to maintain its own hegemony, the United States is engaged in geopolitical contests and bloc confrontation, which goes against the spirit of openness and inclusiveness.
We should remain highly vigilant in this regard and prevent it from hindering the international community’s joint response to challenges, the healthy development of international relations and transformation of the international order toward justice and equity.
As a Chinese saying goes, “Advancing with the times opens up new horizons”. China is ready to work with regional countries to uphold open and inclusive regionalism and jointly promote peace, stability, development and prosperity in the region and the world.
