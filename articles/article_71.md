ndonesia's annoyance with Australia's suspension of the live cattle trade in response to the Australian Broadcasting Association's (ABC) film on the inhumane slaughter of Australian cattle in some Indonesian abattoirs, has reinforced Indonesia's efforts to pursue beef production self-sufficiency.
This policy is clearly unsustainable, as we are seeing, with rising beef prices (irrespective of increased demand during Ramadhan) and livestock farmers selling their breeding stock for slaughter.
Indonesia and Australia have complementary 'comparative economic advantages' when it comes to live cattle trade, making this trade beneficial to both parties. Northern Australia can breed and grow cattle at a lower cost compared to livestock farmers in Indonesia, while Indonesian feedlots can fatten Australian cattle at a lower cost than in Northern Australia. Indonesia can also slaughter Northern Australian cattle at a much lower cost than in Australia.
When Australian cattle are slaughtered in Indonesia, the entire animal is used for productive purposes ' for example, skin for leather (Bandung ' shoes), provides significant 'added value' and employment to Indonesia. Indonesia's Agriculture Ministry's policy of 'self-sufficiency', with its quota system, has only led to 'rent seeking', as we have seen recently.
An Indonesian policy based on the principles of 'food security' would be more appropriate. This would involve the import of livestock/beef from Australia while seeking to make Indonesian domestic producers more competitive. The problem, as always, is to find the right balance between the interests of Indonesian producers and consumers.
According to an article published in The Jakarta Post on July 20, the Indonesian Trade Ministry said that 'Indonesia will remove import quotas for beef and live cattle to stabilize domestic prices and curb inflation'. The proposed scheme, where parity or 'normal' prices are used to assess the need for imports, makes more sense than the quota system applied by the Agriculture Ministry.
Such a scheme is more in line with the concept of food security, as advocated by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and would probably be more acceptable to trading partners in the World Trade Organization.
Unfortunately, much damage has already been done to Indonesian-Australian livestock trade, to the detriment of both Australian and Indonesian producers, as well as consumers. Irrespective of which party wins the next election in Australia (September 2013), the Australian government will likely restrict live cattle trade to Indonesia until more humane slaughter practices are in place.
All parties should be aware that the concept of halal slaughter is not limited to the method of slaughter alone, but more generally to the humane treatment of animals, as advocated by Prophet Muhammad (Hadiths). Australian abattoirs adhere to these halal practices ' Indonesia should adopt them also.
The bottom line is that Australia and Indonesia need to establish reliable, long-term relations in beef trade that respect the interests of both countries. My concern is that, if the Australian and Indonesia governments do not focus on 'reliable, long-term trade relations' in this sector, the Australian beef industry will establish longer-term trade relations with other more reliable trading partners in the Asian region. Indonesia will be the looser!
