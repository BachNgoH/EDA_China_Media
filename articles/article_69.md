Gen. Moeldoko

Indonesian Military (TNI) commander Gen. Moeldoko said on Tuesday that the government had discussed security matters relating to the government's plan to enact a visa-free policy for 30 countries to ensure that no security problems would arise.
In its efforts to bolster the weakening rupiah, the government recently announced that it would waive visa requirements for 30 countries as early as next month to boost tourism in order to net more foreign exchange income.
Your comments:
It's getting funny to see the TNI trying to sneak its nose in or throw its rather unnecessary statements around on everything that's happening in this country lately.
They are kind of missing those good old days when they were relevant in the government.

Of course there will not be any security threats now since the visa on arrival was given for a fee without any background check on the arriving tourist. So, in this respect, it stays exactly the same.

There will, of course, still be a time limit for this visa, which when overstayed will open that person up to the same visa violations that exist. The only difference is tourists will save US$35 and perhaps feel a little more welcome when they arrive.
My biggest gripe about arriving in Indonesia is they never have any bloody pens to fill out your immigration cards with, and I often have to wander around until I can find someone to borrow one off. How much does maintaining a few pens on chains cost?

They have been ripping us off for years by charging for visas in US dollars and when they convert it to rupiah the exchange rate is nothing more than appalling. Where is Indonesia's pride? Surely if true to yourself you should transact in the rupiah and not US dollars.
