hrough its world-first climate-responsive technology, innovative construction and next-generation wellness, ELEMENTIS Development Group is revolutionizing luxury living guided by its four core values of Wellness, Nature, Innovation and Community.
Engineering communities that are connected to nature, thrive on innovation and embrace personalized wellness, the first Elementis property in Indonesia is set to launch in Ubud in the first quarter (Q1) of 2025, followed by properties in Uluwatu later that year.
Also on the horizon are properties opening in Q1 2026 in Farellones, Chile, followed by Elementis Lombok, Sumbawa and Rote in Indonesia, and then in Papudo, Chile.
Founded by Anton Titov and Andrey Skripachev, Elementis aims to inspire a global community united by a passion for socially and emotionally conscious living.
“At the heart of our mission is a commitment to sustainable construction and climate-responsive solutions,” says Titov.
“By partnering with regional industry leaders, maximizing energy efficiency and minimizing environmental impact, we are creating spaces that reflect our dedication to community building and ecological responsibility.”
ELEMENTIS cofounder Andrey Skripachev, who is also chief construction officer, echoes these sentiments and adds that he is always on the lookout for progressive technologies for both business and personal growth.
“Here in Bali, our goal is to integrate cutting-edge technologies with the Balinese culture’s emphasis on harmony with Nature as well as personal and community well-being to inspire a completely new approach to construction. We are not building villas, we are building a vision,” he says.
The company’s approach to integrative Wellness encompasses physical, mental and spiritual health, offering advanced amenities such as ultramodern saunas and OKEARA structured hydrogen water, known for its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, along with a range of other benefits. These form part of the highly personalized programs that enable optimized lifestyles through education and support.
Investment in Nature is vital to ELEMENTIS, as demonstrated by its modern architectural designs that maximize ecological immersion and minimize environmental impact without compromising on comfort.
“We offer abundant opportunities for outdoor recreation and exploration, harmonizing our lifestyles with the natural world,” says Titov.
ELEMENTIS has a profound commitment to Community building as integral to its business ethos. Beyond being a hospitality brand, it strives to unite like-minded individuals who embrace innovation and comprehensive holistic wellness.
“We aim to cultivate a thriving Community that fosters the ongoing development of Elementis and helps us realize our vision,” Titov says.
Innovation is the company’s cornerstone, driving its team to enhance the Elementis experience through collaboration with leading experts while fostering creativity and prioritizing a forward-thinking mindset.
“By utilizing next-generation technology and energy-efficient solutions, the company is leading the way in industry trends and advancements,” says chief hospitality officer Michael Burchett, a veteran hospitality professional with over 45 years in the global industry.
Among the company’s founding partners is Singapore-based Sun-Ice Energy, inventor of the world’s first zero carbon climate control system. All ELEMENTIS structures that require cooling utilizes Sun-Ice Energy’s technology, while all resorts and residences feature special insulated glass and construction techniques to optimize energy efficiency and ensure a healthy living environment.
Complementing Sun-Ice Energy’s world-first climate-responsive technology, all ELEMENTIS resorts and residences are constructed from responsibly sourced glue laminated timber.
Also known as glulam, this engineered wood product is made by bonding thin layers of timber with eco-friendly, durable glue that is also moisture and pest resistant. Compared to other building materials such as cement and steel, glulam’s manufacturing process consumes less energy and produces fewer greenhouse gas emissions.
Glulam will be exclusively supplied locally by Woodlam Indonesia, the nation’s first end-to-end wood consultants. For its engineered timber, Woodlam Indonesia uses the wood of the jabon tree (
Neolamarckia cadamba
), a native tropical evergreen. The company adheres to stringent international regulations that ensure legal and sustainable logging practices.
Working alongside Woodlam Indonesia, Italian building materials supplier Rothoblaas will leverage its latest technologies in connections, waterproofing and safety to enhance the guest experience at Elementis properties, playing a crucial role in the precise integration and connection of glulam components for superior quality and performance.
"Our commitment to sustainable construction and climate-responsive solutions stands at the forefront,” says Titov.
“At ELEMENTIS, we are not just building properties. We are shaping a vision of a holistic lifestyle that is deeply connected to the environment and those around us. We want to inspire a new paradigm where innovation harmonizes with nature, fostering communities that thrive on wellness and shared values."
