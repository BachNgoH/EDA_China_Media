tate-owned China Energy Engineering Corporation (CEEC) is looking to engage in energy projects in countries located along the corridors of China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).
The Chinese state-owned infrastructure company says this could help countries accelerate their energy transition.
CEEC, through its subsidiary China Energy International, said in a statement on Saturday that it would do so by using Chinese standards, technology, management practices and services.
“The company actively engages in international cooperation for new energy, promoting green and low-carbon development along the belt and road route,” said Lu Weiming, who manages China Energy International’s South Asia operations, according to the statement.
During a bilateral meeting with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping in Beijing on Oct. 17, President Joko "Jokowi" Widodo had asked for support in developing renewable energy in Indonesia.
China has vowed to support green development projects through its BRI.
