As we ring in 2024, people around the world are hoping for the better. How to make the world a better place? We need to, first and foremost, understand where we are right now.
President Xi Jinping once quoted Charles Dickens as saying, "It was the best of times, it was the worst of times."
Increasing wealth and advancing technology take human civilization to a historic high. But the harsh reality is that humanity is also in the midst of daunting challenges and risks.
Global growth is sluggish. Geopolitical conflicts are flaring up. A Cold War mentality and power politics still haunts us. Climate change, food insecurity, refugee crises, major infectious diseases – these are all serious challenges that we must face together.
We also see tragedies in Gaza and Ukraine. What is wrong with this world? What kind of world should we build? How to build such a world?
As a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council and a responsible major country, China's answer is to build a community with a shared future for mankind.

It was pointed out at the Central Conference on Work Relating to Foreign Affairs at the end of 2023 in Beijing that building a community with a shared future for mankind was a noble goal of our major-country diplomacy with Chinese characteristics for the new era.
China calls for a community with a shared future for mankind. We aim to build an open, inclusive, clean and beautiful world of lasting peace, universal security and shared prosperity.
The pathway is through promoting global governance that features extensive consultation and joint contribution for shared benefits, for a new form of international relations. This is neither the old thinking of confrontation and alliance, nor the old path of colonization and hegemony.
Even less, the dead end of compromise under oppression. On the contrary, this is the gateway to peaceful development.
We the Chinese people always support world peace for all. This is also in line with the spirit of the Asia-Africa Conference 60 years ago in Bandung, West Java. China never pursues development at the cost of others. A zero-sum game is never our choice.
We have never resorted to invasion or colonization to become the second-largest economy. The Belt and Road Initiative (OBOR), the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative and the Global Civilization Initiative proposed by President Xi resonate well with the international community.
China welcomes all to join the cause toward a community with a shared future for mankind.
China calls for an equal and orderly multipolar world. As President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo stated at the Group of 20 Summit in Bali in November 2022, peace and stability are important for regional and global development.
As major developing countries, China and Indonesia share common goals. How to maintain peace and stability and protect every individual, every company and every country?
China's solution is to build an equal and orderly multipolar world, in which all countries, regardless of size, are treated as equals. Hegemonism and power politics are rejected and democracy is truly promoted in international relations.
The purposes and principles of the UN Charter must be observed by all, the generally universally recognized, basic norms governing international relations must be upheld by all, and true multilateralism must be practiced by all.
China calls for a universally beneficial and inclusive economic globalization. This is especially important for the Asia-Pacific, the most dynamic place full of economic potential.
A universally beneficial and inclusive economic globalization is one that opposes all forms of unilateralism, protectionism and decoupling, firmly promotes trade and investment liberalization and facilitation and makes economic globalization more open, inclusive, balanced and beneficial to all.
For China, Indonesia and other regional countries, the implementation of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) and mutually beneficial cooperation in supply chains are all part of our efforts for a universally beneficial and inclusive economic globalization.
An equal and orderly multipolar world, a universally beneficial and inclusive economic globalization, and greater democracy in international relations are the features of a better world.
Currently, China, together with Indonesia and an increasing number of friendly countries, are building a community-shared future. The Jakarta-Bandung high-speed train (Whoosh), the Suramadu Bridge, timely vaccine assistance from China, popular electric vehicles and Mobile Legends, are all real images of the China-Indonesia community of a shared future.
President Xi quoted an Indonesian proverb during the G20 Bali Summit, "Sugarcane and lemongrass grow in dense clumps." China is ready to work with Indonesia to implement the important consensus reached by our two presidents to build the China-Indonesia community with a shared future, strengthen exchanges and cooperation in all fields, promote peace, stability, development and prosperity for China, Indonesia, the region and the world and deliver a community with a shared future for mankind.
