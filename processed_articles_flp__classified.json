At its core is spending on sports by the $900 billion sovereign wealth operation, the Public Investment Fund, which he oversees.\n\u201cIt\u2019s amazing.

This project will invest in the government\u2019s national fiber optic backbone, middle-mile, and last-mile connectivity infrastructure, while ensuring these facilities are secure against cybersecurity threats and climate risks.\n\u201cA robust broadband connectivity infrastructure is not just a technological necessity; it\u2019s an essential cornerstone for the Philippines to boost growth and attain its goal of becoming an upper middle-income country in the next couple of years,\u201d said Manuela Ferro, World Bank vice president for East Asia and Pacific. \u201cBringing greater internet access to the grassroots can bridge the digital divide, empower communities, and unlock the full potential of the digital economy.\u201d\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nHigh-capacity cables\nThe \u201cnational fiber optic backbone\u201d refers to a network of high-capacity fiber optic cables that interconnect different regions of the country. This network serves as the principal data highway for intra-country communications, carrying large amounts of data at high speeds. This project will complete the remaining parts of the national fiber backbone, connecting the two main international landing stations in Baler (Luzon) and Davao City (Mindanao).\nFEATURED STORIES\nNEWSINFO\nBar exam 2024: List of successful examinees\nNEWSINFO\n3 schools have highest percentage of passers among first-time bar exam takers\nNEWSINFO\nBar exam result 2024: 3,962 passed \u2013 Supreme Court\nInvestments in the \u201cmiddle-mile\u201d infrastructure will extend connectivity from the main backbone to more localized underserved areas in the regions of Western Visayas, Central Visayas, Eastern Visayas, Zamboanga Peninsula, Northern Mindanao, Davao Region, Soccsksargen, and Caraga. Among other steps, this will involve the installation of underground fiber optic cables, which promise to make the network more resilient against disruptions from climate and extreme weather events.\nLast-mile services\nInvestments in the \u201clast mile\u201d infrastructure or those that connect to end-users takes the work one step further by rolling out infrastructure in currently uncovered areas. The project will create infrastructure foundations that will connect public institutions, schools, and hospitals in Eastern Mindanao, along with free-Wi-Fi access points in these facilities. These facilities will pave the way for commercial operators to offer last-mile internet services for households.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\n\u201cImproved internet access will help all Filipinos, especially those in remote areas of Mindanao, gain better education, health care, social protection, and government services,\u201d said Zafer Mustafao\u011flu, World Bank country director for the Philippines, Malaysia, and Brunei Darussalam. \u201cThis project fosters a brighter future for lagging regions by connecting everyone and ensuring that the poorest and most vulnerable Filipinos can benefit from the power of technology.\u201d\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nTo ensure resilience of these investments, the project will incorporate climate data, risks, and resilience measures into the design of the infrastructure. These measures include using climate-resilient materials and conduit systems for underground cables, designing overground infrastructure to withstand strong winds and floods, and incorporating innovative engineering solutions to adapt to climate-related risks, among others.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nA variety of steps will be taken to guarantee the country\u2019s broadband network is safe from cybersecurity threats. For instance, the project will deploy advanced intrusion detection and prevention systems, as well as implement next-generation firewalls. Additional measures include multi-factor authentication for broadband infrastructure access, comprehensive encryption protocols, regular updates to address Wi-Fi vulnerabilities, and provisions against the dual vulnerabilities of natural disasters and cyberthreats.\nExpanding reach\nThe project promises to benefit Filipinos outside the country\u2019s main urban centers, in particular. At present, the delivery of telecommunications, internet connectivity, and other mobile or data-based services concentrates disproportionately in areas of strong commercial viability. This is due to the historic role of the private sector in shaping the market. As a result, almost half (45.5 percent) of all barangays (villages) nationwide are presently not served by a private telecommunications service provider.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nExpanding the reach of broadband connectivity to all regions of the country will help level up this uneven service provision.\nYour subscription could not be saved.

        "content": "Phnom Penh\u2014The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has issued a dire warning about developing nations in Asia and the Pacific being ill-equipped to meet the needs of their rapidly aging populations.\nThe region\u2019s growing elderly demographic faces numerous challenges, including low pension coverage, health issues, social isolation, and limited access to essential services. Urgent and comprehensive policy reforms are required to ensure the welfare of older individuals, as highlighted in the recently released \u201cAging Well in Asia: Asian Development Policy Report\u201d during the bank\u2019s 57th Annual Meeting held from May 2 to 5 in Tbilisi, Georgia.\nBy 2050, the number of individuals aged 60 and above in developing Asia and Pacific nations is projected to nearly double, reaching a staggering 1.2 billion, or about a quarter of total population. This demographic shift means there is urgent need for adequate pension and welfare programs, along with improved health-care services.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThe report, however, notes the potential for a \u201csilver dividend\u201d\u2014additional productivity from older individuals that could potentially increase the region\u2019s gross domestic product by an average of 0.9 percent.\nFEATURED STORIES\nOPINION\nUrgent action needed vs online piracy as Congress session nears end\nOPINION\nLife has shortened\nOPINION\nThe gift of second chances\nADB chief economist Albert Park highlighted the need for prompt government action to prepare for the challenges, and called for policies that focus on lifelong investments in health, education, skills, and financial preparedness for retirement. Additionally, nurturing family and social ties is crucial to foster the well-being and productivity of older people and maximize their contribution to society, he said.\nThe report reveals a distressing statistic: 40 percent of individuals aged over 60 in Asia and the Pacific lack access to any form of pension. This issue disproportionately affects women, who often engage in unpaid domestic work. Consequently, many older individuals are forced to continue working well beyond retirement age merely to make ends meet. Among those still employed at age 65 or older, a staggering 94 percent work in the informal sector, which typically fails to provide basic labor protections or pension benefits.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nBeyond financial concerns, physical and mental health issues become more prevalent with age. The ADB report indicates that some 60 percent of older individuals in the region do not receive regular health checks, while 31 percent report depressive symptoms resulting from illness, social isolation, and economic insecurity. Older women in the region are particularly susceptible to health problems, including depression, diabetes, and hypertension, compared to their male counterparts.To address these pressing challenges, the report calls for a range of policy measures that include government-assisted health insurance and pension plans, improved health infrastructure, and the provision of free annual check-ups and lifestyle evaluations. The report also urges policymakers to strive toward universal health-care coverage and extend basic labor protections to older individuals working in the informal sector.By adopting measures such as flexible retirement ages, promoting health among the elderly, providing suitable work opportunities, and facilitating lifelong learning and skills development, economies in the region can harness the productivity and expertise of older individuals for a longer duration, the report concluded.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nAiko Kikkawa, a senior ADB economist and one of the authors of the report, said Cambodia was not facing an imminent critical condition compared to Thailand or Vietnam. She noted that with its smaller population, Cambodia can transition more rapidly, although she stressed the importance of early preparation to support the population effectively.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThere is also need for collaboration with the young population, and the encouragement of mindfulness about their health, careers, and the importance of retirement savings, Kikkawa added. She emphasized the importance of proactive measures to ensure that the younger generation is adequately prepared for their future.\n\u201c[T]he country has to prepare to be able to support (these current young people). You do not want to wait until you have many older persons,\u201d she said.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThe ADB reaffirmed its commitment to foster a prosperous, inclusive, resilient, and sustainable Asia and the Pacific. The bank aims to eradicate extreme poverty while addressing the challenges posed by the region\u2019s aging population.\nADB chief economist Park also highlighted the bank\u2019s support for modernizing social protection programs for various governments by improving information systems, digitalization, and data collection to enhance access to resources during crises like the COVID-19 pandemic.

Three bookstores, if you expand the radius by half a mile. On rough days, I console myself by marching up to the ever-enticing displays of my neighborhood bookshop. The covers are an invitation.\nThis ritual is a luxury compared to what a trip to a bookstore entails back home in Manila: An hour\u2019s car ride through the city\u2019s weekday traffic (considered the world\u2019s worst in 2023) to access a Fully Booked branch that allows me to browse through its shelves. And even in Manila\u2019s biggest bookstores, the selection can be narrow and outdated.\nOn a trip home in December, I noted that topselling titles had changed little in years. Bookstores may struggle to navigate government regulations that ranked 95th out of 190 in the global ease of doing business in 2020. This is par for the course in a country with one of the highest learning poverty in East Asia and the Pacific, being second only to Laos.

The Philippines is also among the five worst global performers in science, according to the 2022 Programme for International Student Assessment results, and is at the bottom 10 of 81 countries in reading comprehension and mathematics. This dismal education performance worsened during the pandemic as Philippine schools had some of the longest shutdowns in the world.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nIn a country strewn with shopping malls, good bookstores are few and far between. Bookstores account for a dwindling share of the monolithic megamall floor space. The two main book chains, National Bookstore and Fully Booked, have downsized and permanently shuttered some branches even prior to the pandemic. Libraries are similarly inaccessible. A 2023 National Book Development Board (NBDB) survey found that 82 percent of adult respondents were not aware of a library in their locality. In 2022, there were 1,622 public libraries to service the country\u2019s then 112.5 million people, about 76 percent of the number of libraries that exist in Thailand, whose population is much smaller. The selection on offer is likewise restrictive.\nFEATURED STORIES\nOPINION\nUrgent action needed vs online piracy as Congress session nears end\nOPINION\nLife has shortened\nOPINION\nThe gift of second chances\nOf Fully Booked\u2019s top five online bestsellers for teens and adults\u2014a selection that included Atomic Habits by James Clear and Emma by Jane Austen\u2014the latest release was from 2019.

Rowling, William Shakespeare, Sidney Sheldon, and Nicholas Sparks. In sharp contrast, the window display of my local Cambridge bookstore changes weekly.\nLimited literary offerings curb the country\u2019s future growth. Research in the Journal of Global Health finds that access to at least one book at home nearly doubles the probability that a child is on track in literacy and numeracy. Self-directed reading for pleasure has been linked to stronger academic performance in English, mathematics, science, and history. Fundamental to this process is what a Scholastic education report calls \u201cwide reading driven by access to abundant books and personal choice.\u201d\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nSince academic performance has a significant impact on children\u2019s later economic status, an investment in their reading life is an investment in their future. Calls to expand access to nonschool-related reading should be seen as a vital investment in the country\u2019s education infrastructure.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThe Philippines should look to neighboring Vietnam as an example. A key component of Vietnam\u2019s continued economic expansion has been its heavy investment in its education system. The secret of Vietnamese students\u2019 stellar school performance lies in Vietnam\u2019s high cultural regard for the value of education, home environments conducive to learning, and well-trained teachers. All of these require a society\u2019s investment in literacy and a deeper appreciation for books.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThe Philippines has already taken a few steps in the right direction. Efforts by the NBDB to foster local book publishing and set up reading nooks are expanding book accessibility and interest. But the government should do more to ensure Filipinos\u2019 access to a rich literary diet. It should invest in more public libraries, host traveling book fairs with subsidized titles, and lean in to lending electronic copies. Failure to act means accepting our students\u2019 dismal performance in international education assessments, and conceding that a rich reading life is a luxury reserved for the wealthy.\nBookstores are a testament to the height of human achievement and potential.

        "content": "Many problems keep the ordinary Filipino up at night. A recent Pulse Asia survey commissioned by the Stratbase Institute said seven in 10 Filipinos are deeply concerned with the escalating inflation crisis. This concern is first on the list of respondents\u2019 urgent national concerns. Worse, 74 percent of respondents believe that the current administration\u2019s response to this concern is inadequate.\nStill, despite this concern about the cost-of-living crisis in the country, consumers remain optimistic about our prospects. The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) found that in the first quarter of this year, consumer sentiment improved, according to its consumer outlook index. People expect additional income and greater availability of permanent employment.\nUnfortunately, businesses in the Philippines are not as optimistic. The BSP in its Business Expectations Survey Report found that in the same period, businesses grappled with dwindling demand leading to a slowdown in economic activities, rising inflation, and the threat of climate-induced disruptions. We are already feeling this through the prevailing El Ni\u00f1o conditions.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nWhose concerns, then, more accurately reflect the Philippines\u2019 current state? Shall we go by businesses\u2019 more realistic and less upbeat outlook because we could presume they would be more objective in their assessment of the business environment? Or should consumers\u2019 expectations be given more weight, since it is they who directly experience the effects of economic ebbs and flows?\nFEATURED STORIES\nOPINION\nUrgent action needed vs online piracy as Congress session nears end\nOPINION\nLife has shortened\nOPINION\nThe gift of second chances\nHow are we to reconcile these seemingly conflicting or incongruous beliefs about the coming days? Perhaps we should give credence to both.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nAcross Southeast Asia, the Philippines is often compared to Vietnam and Thailand in terms of economic makeup and prospects. Vietnam is touted as a consistent outperformer in attracting foreign investments, outpacing the Philippines as an ideal investment destination.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nSince 2014, the World Bank has underscored the need for the Philippines to revise the economic provisions of its Constitution, specifically its strict restrictions against foreign ownership. Indeed, in this globalized business environment, the Philippines can only claim to embrace economic liberalization by dismantling barriers to foreign ownership.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThe merits of opening up our industries to foreign ownership have been cited numerous times. Foreign investment boosts the economy because it causes the improvement of infrastructure and enables industries to thrive. Moreover, it generates jobs for Filipinos, bringing them a sustainable source of income and allowing them to improve their quality of life. And then they would not worry too much about their cost of living.\nThe Philippines is the sole Asean country to still have numerous constitutional constraints on foreign investment: This is a strategic disadvantage that we must take active steps to change. We must position ourselves to be competitive in the international economic arena. We have to position ourselves as a favorable location on the global investment map especially since economic giants are looking to derisk and decouple.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nWe have been laggards for far too long because we have been crippled by these restrictions. Revisiting and amending the economic provisions of the Constitution should not be equated to any political moves that could serve specific interests. By focusing only on the economic provisions, we assert that there is a more fundamental, significantly more important beneficiary of initiatives to amend the Constitution\u2014the Filipino people.\nAnd it appears, as well, that Filipinos are aware of the nuances of Charter change. The same Pulse Asia survey of March 2024 revealed that nearly 40 percent of respondents advocate for a more inclusive approach to economic growth and see increased foreign participation in local businesses as a potential catalyst. If the people themselves have this sentiment, then this should be supported by policies that foster a conducive environment for foreign investors to enhance the nation\u2019s economic trajectory.\nYet another Stratbase-commissioned Pulse Asia survey from September 2023 shows that Filipinos across diverse demographics and socioeconomic strata believe that strategic partnerships with trusted allies are pivotal to economic security. That survey revealed that the United States, Japan, and Australia stand out as the most favored countries with which the Philippines must collaborate, not only for defense security but also for economic security which is felt more acutely by the people.\nBusinesses\u2019 less-than-upbeat sentiment is justified as they are directly at risk, and suffer from the constraints and roadblocks that keep our economy from achieving its full potential. But consumers\u2019 optimistic take should also be considered: There remains room for growth and improvement despite economic challenges, and one way is to acknowledge\u2014and act on\u2014the fact that we need foreign investments to jump-start our industries.\nThe government must take heed of this.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\nYour subscription could not be saved.

Additionally, they provide food security for local communities and help maintain water quality by filtering nutrients, sediment, and trash.&nbsp;\n\u201cAt RAFI, we believe that a balanced, thriving environment is essential to building resilient, prosperous, and vibrant communities. With GCash as our partner, we\u2019re making meaningful strides toward a greener, more sustainable tomorrow. Since our project started in 2021, we are able to grow more than a million seedlings both upland and mangroves and equipped 648 farmers and fisherfolk with the tools and support they need to thrive,\u201d said Estee Marie Plunket, RAFI\u2019s Chief Partnerships Officer.\nLivelihood Opportunities for Farmers&nbsp;\nAside from planting mangroves, RAFI and GCash planted over 600,000 native trees, including bangkal, mamalis, molave and narra, as well as a variety of fruit-bearing trees such as avocado, cacao and rambutan.\nThrough these efforts and GCash\u2019s new GFarm program, the trained farmers who manage and cultivate these areas are given the opportunity to sell the fruits of the trees, providing stable income that significantly improves their livelihood.&nbsp;\nOne of the beneficiaries, Mang Renante, has experienced firsthand the positive impact of this project on his community\u2019s welfare.&nbsp;\n\u201cMalaki aking pasasalamat sa RAFI at GCash kasi mga kasamahan ko, mga miyembro sa aming association nabigyan sila ng pangangailangan,\u201d\nhe shares.

At tsaka lalong lalo na sa financial, malaki na ang naitulong ng GCash parati sa amin dahil nadagdagan ang income namin mangingisda.\u201d\n(\u201cThrough the trees we are planting, the air around us is fresher, and we\u2019ve seen more fish in the ocean thanks to this project, especially the mangroves. GCash has also made a big difference for us, helping our income as fishermen grow.\u201d)\nMichael Miscala, Treasurer: (VCBRMA) Victoria Community Based Resource Management Association\nBe part of the movement today with GForest\nThanks to GForest, millions of Filipinos have the opportunity to be a green hero for the environment. As of Nov 2024, 19.7M Filipinos have joined the movement to plant trees. Through users\u2019 everyday transactions on the GCash app, such as cashing in, sending money, paying bills, or even registering up to 20,000 steps per day, they can earn green energy points to plant digital trees, which in turn will be converted into actual trees by GCash and its partners.&nbsp;\nWith GForest, tree planting is made easy; earn energy points with every GCash transaction and turn them into real trees.

These are strategic investments that underscore our commitment to asserting our territorial integrity,\u201d Poe explained.\nIn the reconciled version, the soldiers\u2019 subsistence allowance was likewise raised from P150 to P350 a day, or P10,500 a month.\nOther gainers\n\u201cWe honor our soldiers, the front-liners of our nation\u2019s defense, by ensuring that they have the resources they need to fulfill their duties,\u201d she added.\nThe budget of the Philippine Coast Guard was increased by P800 million to P33.2 billion \u201cto ensure that our coastlines are patrolled and secured, safeguarding not just our territory but also the livelihoods of our beloved fisherfolk.\u201d\nThe Department of Foreign Affairs also received a P500-million adjustment in its budget to P27.6 billion to \u201cstrengthen our diplomatic missions and ensure that our country\u2019s interests are upheld and our voice is heard in the international community,\u201d Poe said.\nShe added that they have funded the operations of the courts and the social lawyering fund to ensure fast and fair attainment of justice.\n\u201cWe also bolstered the fight against human trafficking and child sexual abuse as well as cybercrimes through increased funding for our justice sector,\u201d Poe said.\nThe budget for the Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT) was also jacked up by P4 billion to P12.4 billion \u201cto expand our digital literacy efforts so that more Filipinos can keep up with the ever-changing and evolving technology.\u201d\n\u201cWe did the same for the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) for better traffic management that will alleviate congestion and boost productivity in Metro Manila,\u201d Poe said.\nFocus on infrastructure\nThe MMDA will see an increase of P3 billion in its 2025 budget to P8.8 billion.\nIn a bid to support sustainable tourism programs that provide livelihood in various communities, lawmakers also approved an increase of P300 million in the budget of the Department of Tourism to P3.8 billion next year.\nPoe said the National Economic and Development Authority will also be given additional funds\u2014from the House-approved P12.29 billion to the bicam panel\u2019s P12.35 billion\u2014to ensure that government projects are according to a master plan that would provide jobs to millions of Filipinos.\n\u201cWe recognize the growing frequency and intensity of natural disasters. Our response is more robust funding for disaster preparedness and rehabilitation.

As the green beam pierced the darkness, one could almost imagine it as an unorthodox holiday greeting, albeit one that could potentially blind our sailors.\nIncidents like these remind us of the challenges faced by our courageous men and women guarding the waters of the West Philippine Sea. Hasa-Hasa Shoal, a part of our exclusive economic zone (EEZ), isn\u2019t just a spot on the map\u2014it\u2019s a resource-rich area teeming with marine life, a haven for Filipino fishers, and a symbol of our national identity.\nWhile the laser incident might sound like a scene from a sci-fi movie, it\u2019s a stark reminder of the reality we face: a need to assert our sovereign rights without losing sight of diplomacy and peace. Let us not be intimidated by these bright displays; instead, let them serve as a spotlight on the pressing need for unity\u2014both domestically and internationally.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThe Philippines has always been a nation that values dialogue, justice, and mutual respect. We have demonstrated our commitment to these principles through the legal and diplomatic avenues we\u2019ve pursued, most notably the 2016 arbitral ruling that affirmed our rights in the West Philippine Sea.\nFEATURED STORIES\nOPINION\nUrgent action needed vs online piracy as Congress session nears end\nOPINION\nLife has shortened\nOPINION\nThe gift of second chances\nYet, these rights are not just about us. They resonate with all nations that believe in the rule of law and the importance of maintaining peace and stability in international waters. Our maritime zones are part of a larger network that supports global trade, biodiversity, and climate resilience. Protecting these waters is a shared responsibility.\nWe call on our friends in the international community to shine a light of their own on this issue. This is not merely a bilateral matter between the Philippines and China; it\u2019s a question of respecting international law and ensuring that no nation can claim what isn\u2019t theirs through coercion or force.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nFrom Asean partners to the broader global family, we urge you to amplify your voices. Support initiatives that uphold peace and the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (Unclos). Stand with us in asserting that the future of these waters lies in sustainable development, not conflict.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nTo our fellow Filipinos, let this serve as a rallying cry\u2014not to war, but to unwavering vigilance and unity. Every fisher who sails these waters, every soldier who guards our outposts, and every citizen who supports our claim, strengthens our stance. Together, we are a nation that believes in fairness, peace, and sovereignty.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nAnd to the unidentified vessel that brought a light show to Hasa-Hasa Shoal, let this be our message: the Philippines does not stand in darkness. We are guided by the light of our laws, our allies, and our indomitable spirit.\nSo, let us steer forward, navigating these contested waters with confidence.

        "content": "Athletes aren\u2019t really a tough crowd to shop for, if you truly know what tickles their fancy\u2014here\u2019s our 2024 gift guide that will add some cheer to anyone on your list\nIt\u2019s the Yuletide season once again. While it\u2019s fun and fulfilling to give gifts during the holidays, it\u2019s often difficult and confusing in deciding what to get your active loved one. All the jargon, gadgets, and equipment they use can be a little bit too much sometimes. But we\u2019re here to help. Here\u2019 our 2024\nMultisport\ngift guide that\u2019s perfect for your aspiring or veteran athlete.\nP1,000 or less\nWheyl Nutrition Co. supplements, P799\nRecovery\nis a key word for any athlete. You can\u2019t ask your body to perform at a high level if recovery is compromised. Nutrition is an integral part of recovery and one of my go-to supplements is whey protein. It\u2019s easy to get confused with different brands since they all practically look and taste the same but consider\nWheyl\n.\nIt is a proudly Filipino brand that takes a unique spin on your favorite post-workout drink. They have lots of fun flavors such as melon milk, ube, and matcha; they also haven\u2019t forgotten about the all-time greats such as salted chocolate, naked white (plain), and clean caramel. This holiday season try out the cinnamon spice to really soak in the holiday vibes.\nP1,000 to P3,000\nPSI x Jamborun Core run singlet and run jersey, P 1,000 and P1,200\nPSI\nis another proud Filipino brand that has been one of the top custom apparel manufacturers since 2012. They produce hundreds of thousands of pieces of apparel with an emphasis on quality, sustainability, and durability.\nRecently, they have forayed into retail to help suit more people\u2019s training needs. One item we got exclusive eyes on is their\nCore run singlet\n. This singlet features the most advanced fabrics that are lightweight and sweat-wicking to keep you cool even during the hottest days.\nPSI is supporting the\nJamborun initiative\nof\nInes Santiago\n, one of the fastest women in the local triathlon scene. For every singlet that you buy, 10 less fortunate kids will be fed via the NVC Foundation.\nSpirulina Blue Extra, P2,000\nIn a perfect world, we would get all our nutrients from whole foods in a farm-to-table setup. Unfortunately, this is hard to attain. We need to fill in nutritional gaps with multivitamins and other\nsupplements\n. One of the hidden gems I discovered is the\nLifestream Spirulina Blue Extra\n.\nThis is not your ordinary spirulina as it comes from blue algae that is higher in bioavailable phycocyanin. It is a powerful antioxidant that may work in tandem with B vitamins, GLA, and zeaxanthin to help enhance your resilience from stress. Whether it be faster recovery, better immunity, or extra energy, Spirulina Blue Extra is a necessary part of my own supplement toolbox.\nTYR Special Ops 3.0, P2,539\nGoggles\nall look almost the same but in terms of fit, they are worlds apart. Smaller goggles might look more streamlined but are sometimes painful to the eye sockets. But thicker ones tend to feel bulky or may even leak if the gaskets don\u2019t suit your facial structure. Luckily, I chanced upon the TYR Special Ops line and they\u2019ve been part of my favorites ever since.\nThe\nSpecial Ops 3.0\nis the newest version and has improved on the previous successes of the past models. It features a soft silicone gasket that is wide and thick enough to dissipate the pressure without appearing too bulky. The lenses are also wide and clear, which makes it perfect for both pool and\nopen-water swimming\n. It also comes in multiple colors and tints to help you find the perfect combination for your next pool session.\nP3,000 to P10,000\nWahoo Tickr Fit heart rate monitor, P4,900\nMonitoring your\nheart rate\ncan be a powerful tool for success. It\u2019s a good way to keep track of effort, progress, and even dehydration or stress. However, some people, especially females, find it difficult to wear traditional chest straps as they can sometimes be uncomfortable or inconvenient. Luckily, there\u2019s a unisex heart rate monitor that will address your concerns.\nThe\nWahoo Tickr Fit\nis an arm-based heart rate monitor that is both rechargeable and accurate. It comes with a universal arm strap you can wrap around your bicep or forearm. The best part is it has Bluetooth and ANT+, which means it can work with practically any GPS device (or phone) out there.\nPassion Kitchen Manila Meals\n,\nP5,500 to P10,000 for a two-week weekday plan (depending on calorie requirements)\nIt\u2019s hard to stick to a diet plan if you have a very busy schedule. Aside from the overhead needed to prepare your daily meals, it\u2019s hard to add variety to your usual meals. On top of that, quality, calorie goals, and nutrient requirements are also things you have to consider.\nThat\u2019s where\nPassion Kitchen Manila\nshines. I got this meal plan for my wife\u2019s fitness journey and she\u2019s been raving about it ever since. For one, she doesn\u2019t have to worry about things like \u201cWhat do I prepare?\u201d or \u201cI want something different!\u201d The daily meals feature a variety of cuisines and ingredients that make it much more palatable. Since then, she\u2019s lost several kilos and has felt a boost of energy throughout the day. Meals can also be customized to your goals, whether it be to lose weight, gain weight, or simply be healthier.\nP10,000 to P20,000\nNew Balance Fresh Foam 1080 v14, P10,295\nThe longest running shoe line by New Balance just got better. The Fresh Foam 1080\u2019s 14\nth\nedition focuses on comfort and support, making it the perfect all-around shoe. It\u2019s probably the shoe I recommend the most as you practically can\u2019t go wrong with it.\nIt\u2019s renowned for its super soft sole that doesn\u2019t feel squishy or unsettling. This year, they emphasized greater support so it can also work well for those who have flat feet or pronate too aggressively. Personally, I like it as a casual shoe that I can use all day at the mall or theme park without any pain or discomfort.\nP20,000 to P50,000\nGarmin Edge 540 | Edge 540 Solar, P21,970 | P27.990\nThe Edge 540 is one of Garmin\u2019s most popular and most practical cyclocomputers. It packs a punch with lots of cool features such as the ConnectIQ App store, multi-band GPS, clear and responsive colored touchscreen, and ultra-long battery life.\nIf you\u2019re willing to spend a bit more, get the solar version for improved battery life as it essentially charges your unit as you ride outdoors. All these features come jampacked into a form factor that is neither too compact nor bulky. It\u2019s perfect for your coffee rides, training sessions, and races.\nWahoo Kickr Core, P50,000\nThe Wahoo Kickr Core is one of the most cost-effective trainers out in the market. It uses the same motor that was used in their top of the line Kickr a few years back. Now, at a much lower price range, you can have access to that same technology.\nWith a direct drive form factor, it makes the power readings more accurate and reliable. There\u2019s also less wear and tear from your wheelset and tires unlike traditional trainers. The best part is, Wahoo is well-known for its good customer support and warranty policies.\nP50,000+\nGarmin Fenix 8 Sapphire 47mm and 51mm, P63,490 and P77,790\nThe Garmin Fenix 8 is the newest state-of-the-art multisport watch. By multisport, I really mean multisport: It\u2019s good for triathlons, trail runs, ultra endurance events, even diving, camping, and golf. It\u2019s miles apart in terms of improvement from its predecessors as it comes with an option to have an ultra-crisp AMOLED screen that works well even in direct sunlight. It also has an added feature that makes it more practical: voice calls (through your phone). The screens are also a bit bigger than before.\nWahoo Kickr Move, P108,000\nNow when it comes to a perfect\npain cave\naddition, I\u2019ll have to swear by the Wahoo Kickr Move. This trainer is perhaps the most advanced in the market. It still comes with the Axis feet that give it that side-to-side movement but now also comes with a base that moves forward and back: similar to what you would experience when riding outdoors. It comes with the most advanced, most accurate self-calibrating motor Wahoo has to offer.\nRead more",

The Kadiwa kiosks are open Tuesdays to Saturdays from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nWhile there is no limit on the amount of rice that can be purchased, the DA said it is available only in prepacked sizes of 5 kilograms and 10 kilograms.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nResponse to high rice prices\nDe Mesa, also the DA\u2019s spokesperson, said Food Terminal Inc., the department\u2019s partner in implementing this initiative, will adjust its plans including increasing the quantity of rice sacks delivered to Kadiwa kiosks after stocks sold out quickly during the initial rollout.\nThe DA brought the Rice-for-All program to public markets in response to \u201cpersistently high\u201d retail prices despite reduced tariff rates and declining global rice prices.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nExecutive Order No. 62 slashed the import duty on rice to 15 percent until 2028 from 35 percent previously in a bid to augment local supply, manage prices and ease the inflationary pressure of commodities.\nAgriculture Secretary Francisco Tiu Laurel Jr. said this would \u201cforce rice retailers and unscrupulous traders who refuse to pass onto consumers the benefit of lower rice prices.\u201d\nDe Mesa said the Rice-for-All program will be implemented next in Balintawak (Cloverleaf) Market, Cartimar Market, Pateros Grace Marketplace, Maypajo Public Market and Paco Market, and eventually in provincial markets.\nThe government had earmarked an additional P5-billion budget for Rice-for-All and P29 rice programs, with the latter aimed at making discounted rice available to about 6.9 million low-income households.\n\u2018Sulit\u2019 and \u2018nutri\u2019 rice\nThe sulit and nutri rice available next year will be priced at P36 and P38 per kilogram, respectively, Agriculture Assistant Secretary Genevieve Guevarra said during the Saturday News Forum in Quezon City. She described nutri rice as \u201cbrownish\u201d while sulit rice as white but \u201csuper broken.\u201d\nThe new rice varieties are in addition to the P40 per kilogram price for mixed local and imported well-milled rice currently offered at Kadiwa stores.\nWhen asked if further price cuts at Kadiwa stores were possible, Guevarra said the government is \u201cbalancing\u201d the situation as it could have a \u201cripple effect\u201d on farmers.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a ripple effect if it drops too low. Of course, if I\u2019m planting rice, I might be discouraged to plant more because, if it is that low, I might not make any money,\u201d she said.\nNew livelihood program\nMeanwhile, the DA and the Department of Labor and Employment (Dole) have signed a memorandum of agreement (MOU) to offer government-funded livelihood programs for small business owners at Kadiwa stores.\nBased on the MOU, the livelihood funds, ranging from P500,000 to P3 million under the Dole Integrated Livelihood Program, target agriculture workers, particularly farmers and fisherfolk, as well as labor unions and other sectoral associations.\nYour subscription could not be saved.

With the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in November 2023, anyone involved with the LGBTQ+ community could be imprisoned for up to six years.\nAs a result, many left the country. But others remain \u2013 and find themselves in a community pushed into the shadows, marginalized even further and dogged by fear of repression.\n\u201cSix years, it\u2019s not a joke,\u201d Olga Baranova, head of the Moscow Community Center for LGBT+ Initiatives, said in an interview from outside Russia. \u201c\u2019What is worth me going to prison for six years?\u2019 Every person who\u2019s doing something right now (in LGBTQ+ activism in Russia) has to answer this question these days.\u201d\nFILE PHOTO: A police officer detains a gay rights activist in Red Square in Moscow on Feb. 7, 2014. (Associated Press Photo/Evgeny Feldman, File)\nTargeting nightclubs, rainbow flags, and gay tourism\nJust days after the Supreme Court ruling, the LGBTQ+ community was rattled by news of police raiding gay bars, nightclubs and venues that hosted drag shows in Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities.\nLast spring, the first criminal case on charges of involvement with the \u201cLGBT movement\u201d extremist group was lodged against the owner and the staff of a bar in the southwestern city of Orenburg that held drag performances. A handful of similar cases came elsewhere.\nCharges have been launched for displaying symbols such as a rainbow flag \u2013 even though many of those accused had nothing to do with the LGBTQ+ community, said human rights lawyer Max Olenichev.\nMore raids of bars and nightclubs were reported in Moscow last month, almost exactly a year since the Supreme Court ruling. State media quoted law enforcement as saying they targeted those spreading \u201cLGBT propaganda.\u201d\nREAD:\nRussian LGBTQ+ museum closes after new law bans \u2018gay propaganda\u2019\nOne man arrested for allegedly running a travel agency for gay customers faces charges of organizing activities of an extremist organization. Independent news outlet Mediazona reported that Andrei Kotov rejected the charges and said in court that law enforcement officers beat him and administered electric shocks during the arrest, even though he didn\u2019t resist.\nOn Nov. 23, Putin signed into law a bill banning the adoption of Russian children by citizens of countries where gender-affirming care is legal. He also approved legislation outlawing the spread of material that encourages people not to have children.\n\u201cAll this, in general, speaks more about the desire of the authorities to create some kind of atmosphere of fear. It\u2019s not repressions, it\u2019s terror,\u201d said Vladimir, an LGBTQ+ rights advocate in Russia who like many interviewed by AP asked to be identified only by a first name out of security concerns.\nIkar, a fellow activist and transgender man, described the actions by authorities as \u201can attempt to intimidate \u2026 to make people lose their social connections, stay silent, stay home.\u201d\nGoing underground, online or abroad\nVladimir and Ikar belong to an underground LGBTQ+ rights group that offers legal aid and holds offline events without fanfare. Activists thoroughly verify identities of anyone seeking its help.\nThe group is seeing a growing number of cases related to violence against LGBTQ+ people, Vladimir said.\nSome regional organizations have shut down completely; others operate openly, but in a drastically different way. The Moscow Community Center for LGBT+ Initiatives moved its community-building efforts into a sprawling online network of chats and Zoom meeting rooms, according to Baranova.\n\u201cOur strategy today is to preserve the community in some form and size at least, for the people to just know each other, support each other,\u201d she said.\nCenter T, a prominent trans rights group, closed its Moscow shelter after visits from police and opened one in Yerevan, Armenia, said group leader Yan Dvorkin. Center T helps emigres as well as those still in Russia to find doctors and medical care, trying to resolve crises and still be a part of a community, if only online.\nAnna, a 25-year-old transgender woman in Moscow, said being part of the community provided the courage to transition. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine what it\u2019s like for new people, who are only opening up the possibility for themselves,\u201d she said.\nAnna transitioned and came out to her family and friends last year, after the ban on gender-affirming care was enacted.\nFILE PHOTO: Gay rights activists hold a banner reading \u201cHomophobia \u2013 the religion of bullies\u201d during a protest on Red Square in Moscow on July 14, 2013. (Associated Press Photo/Evgeny Feldman, File)\nThe ban and other repressive laws and rulings hit the already-vulnerable transgender community hard, Dvorkin said.\nFinding a job has become more difficult, both for those who haven\u2019t changed their gender marker in documents and those who have, he said. Access to gender-affirming medical care is a major issue, with doctors wary of working with transgender people and with many turning to shoddy underground medications.\nViolence against transgender people has spiked, as has harassment and discrimination, Dvorkin said.\n\u201cNowadays, you can intimidate people \u2013 blackmail them \u2013 by (saying) that \u2018I will report you and you will go to prison for extremism,\u2019\u201d the activist said.\nThose who stay in Russia, despite the risks\nAnna considers herself lucky and \u201cprivileged.\u201d She has a well-paying job, can afford a doctor advising her from abroad on hormonal therapy, and can get the medicine in Moscow. She wouldn\u2019t elaborate on how and where she gets it, so authorities \u201cdon\u2019t pull the plug.\u201d\nBut she said she hasn\u2019t come out to her colleagues for fear of losing her job, and she is sometimes harassed on the street because of her appearance. Her identity documents can\u2019t be changed under the ban.\nShe says she has a support network of friends and doesn\u2019t want to leave Russia, even though she\u2019s acutely aware of the risks.\n\u201cI somehow have managed to adapt,\u201d she said. \u201cI know how to live here.\u201d\nYulia, another transgender woman, also vowed to stay, describing it as sort of a mission to show that \u201cpeople like me are not necessarily weak, are not necessarily useless.\u201d\nIn her mid-40s, Yulia has a family and children, a successful career in a male-dominated industry, and the respect and acceptance from her colleagues and friends. For her, \u201cit\u2019s about normalizing\u201d being trans, she said.\nHow much \u201cnormalizing\u201d is possible in the current climate and the years ahead is still an open question.\nThe\nban on \u201cpropaganda of nontraditional sexual relations\u201d\nforces print, TV, and movie censorship of LGBTQ+ relations. In a recent example, two Russian streaming services cut a transgender character from the 1990 drama series \u201cTwin Peaks.\u201d\nAt the same time, there is abundant official rhetoric from politicians, the Russian Orthodox clergy and media figures condemning LGBTQ+ people.\nMany like Gela Gogishvili, the gay man who fled Russia last year, worry about the next generation of LGBTQ+ people.\nHe said he\u2019s \u201ceven more scared for those who are born there and are currently growing up -\u2013 from their childhood years onwards, they will be taught that (being queer) is bad.\u201d\nYour subscription could not be saved.

It has expanded over the years and now has 80 garden plots and a plant nursery. (Photo courtesy of San Miguel Corp.)\nThe government and the private sector as well have been looking at urban farming as one of the key solutions to achieving food security, a view that was further cemented at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nListed conglomerate San Miguel Corp. (SMC) is actively championing this movement, having launched in 2021 its Backyard Bukid initiative in order to augment food supplies and income of its service personnel during such a difficult time.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nSMC piloted its backyard farm nestled at the company\u2019s head office complex in Mandaluyong City. Situated behind its iconic Francisco Manosa-designed building, the urban farm has more than 30 varieties of vegetables and flowering plants.&nbsp;&nbsp;\u201cMost of the crops from the \u2018Bahay Kubo\u2019 song can be found in our urban farms, SMC tells the Inquirer.\nFEATURED STORIES\nBUSINESS\nMore foreign brands seen coming to PH shores in 2025\nBUSINESS\nGlobal Dominion: Simplifying financing to empower every Filipino\nBUSINESS\nInternational group kicks off infrastructure investment drive for PH\nREAD:\nChange is in the air: A new era begins\nThese include ampalaya, eggplant, string beans, patola, upo, mustasa, tomatoes, and ginger; plant herbs such as sweet basil, rosemary and tarragon; and leafy greens like lettuce, arugula, kale and bokchoy.&nbsp;An undertaking of the San Miguel Foundation,&nbsp; the project has since been grown to include a plant nursery and about 80 garden plots that serve as a center for employee wellness, volunteerism and training.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThe initiative has also expanded in terms of locations, such that SMC now has five Backyard Bukid sites. Aside from the company\u2019s headquarters, there are also on-premises farms at the&nbsp; San Miguel Yamamura Packaging Corp. facilities in General Trias, Cavite and Pandacan, Manila; SMC Better World Smokey Mountain Community Center in Tondo; and Bulacan Bulk Water facility in Bulacan.&nbsp;Also, there are two community-based Backyard Bukid sites in Camarines Sur and Hagonoy, Davao Del Sur. A third one is set for launch in Bukidnon, meant for the residents of communities near SMC facilities.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nFor its part, the government recognized the crucial role of urban agriculture, or the practice of cultivating crops in limited spaces in the metropolis, by creating a dedicated banner program.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nIn 2022, the Department of Agriculture (DA) introduced the National Urban and Peri-Urban Agriculture Program (Nupap) to develop farming in urban and peri-urban areas or locations between the city and the countryside.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThe DA says urban gardening \u201cis seen as an intervention in achieving food security and providing alternative sources of livelihood,\u201d a thrust that is spelled out in Administrative Order No. 3 signed in 2022 and which created the Nupap.\n\u201cThe country is faced with rising pressures due to unstable food supplies, climate change, and growing unemployment as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic,\u201d the DA says.\nThis initiative seeks to increase food production and reduce costs to cushion the impact of global concerns such as food security, climate change and rising costs of fuel and other farm inputs.\nREAD:\nBanking runs deep in Favilas\u2019 veins\nMeanwhile, the San Miguel group is keen on replicating the Backyard Bukid in other areas where the conglomerate has offices nationwide.\n\u201cGiven its success, we\u2019ve been working to expand the program and bring it to our other facilities and partner communities. We are also looking at bringing more learning sessions about urban farming to encourage more employees to take part in this initiative,\u201d SMC says.\nLast January, the project was expanded through a partnership with nonprofit organization Urban Farmers PH, to enhance the farms\u2019 diversity and variety of produce.

This year, the government earmarked P406.13 million to implement this project, higher than P376 million in 2023. The BPI is seeking a budget of P439 million in 2025, an increase of 8 percent from this year if approved.\nIn a briefer provided to the Inquirer, the Nupap Secretariat says that one of the major projects for the coming year is the provision of agricultural machinery, equipment and facility support services with an indicative funding of P143.16 million.\nIn light of this, the establishment of production facilities \u2014 particularly protected agriculture systems and controlled environment agriculture\u2014 were prioritized in order to achieve an optimal growing environment for crops even with harsh weather conditions.\nThus, interventions under the Nupap include greenhouses (in various iterations like rainshelters, rainshelters with drip irrigation, screenhouses, nethouses, grow-out nurseries, greenhouses with hydroponics, and solar-powered greenhouses with hydroponics) as well as indoor cultivation systems or containerized vertical farms, and mushroom houses.\nThe proposed budget for Nupap initiatives also covers infrastructure projects such as poultry houses, vermicomposting facilities, edible landscaping and packaging houses.\nAside from support services and training programs, the Nupap implementers will distribute seeds and planting materials, primarily highland and lowland vegetables and herbs and spices given their relatively shorter growing period and are easily cultivated in limited spaces.\nDuring ceremonies held in September to give recognition to outstanding urban and peri-urban gardens, Agriculture Secretary Francisco Tiu Laurel Jr. cited the crucial role of urban agriculture in addressing global challenges including food security.\nREAD:\nTimeless BSP art: A glimpse into Remolona\u2019s favorites\n\u201cFrom mitigating climate change to enhancing food resilience and improving mental well-being, your gardens serve purposes beyond mere aesthetics,\u201d Tiu Laurel says.\nThe World Bank estimates that by 2050, about 102 million Filipinos will be living in cities, equivalent to more than 65 percent of the country\u2019s total population.

Aba\u00f1o\nILOILO CITY, Philippines \u2014 Boracay Island, world-renowned for its pristine beaches and vibrant tourism, may soon set a precedent as the first gun-free zone in the Western Visayas region.\nThe regional police and the Regional Peace and Order Council (RPOC) recently expressed their bid to redefine security standards in major tourist spots, especially Boracay in Malay, Aklan, one of the country\u2019s prime destinations.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\n\u201cWestern Visayas is one of the areas where we have plenty of tourist destinations \u2026 The purpose is for local government units to pass an ordinance identifying these specific areas where they will declare the gun-free zone,\u201d said Police Brig.

This [gun-free zone] project is our way of addressing these issues,\u201d Wanky said.\nThe gun-free proposal is seen to bolster Boracay\u2019s reputation as a safe and family-friendly destination, aligning with its one-entry, one-exit system that simplifies security monitoring.\nThe regional police team has started coordinating with local officials, residents, and business owners to determine specific zones for the policy\u2019s initial rollout.\nThe success of the Boracay pilot could pave the way for other Western Visayas tourist destinations to follow suit. With the RPOC\u2019s resolution encouraging regionwide adoption, places like Guimaras, Iloilo City and other Aklan towns may soon join the initiative.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of work to do, but we\u2019re confident this will make Boracay an even more peaceful place for tourists,\u201d Wanky said.\nThe Department of Tourism (DOT) has set a target of over 2 million tourists in Boracay by the end of the year.\nIn 2022, the DOT unveiled three \u201ctourism circuits\u201d that they intended to promote\u2014something the agency described as \u201cdeviant\u201d from the usual beach and Meetings, Incentives, Conferences and Exhibits (Mice) that they\u2019ve promoted in previous years.\nYour subscription could not be saved.

        "content": "FILE PHOTO (REUTERS/Kacper Pempel)\nA new study commissioned by the\nMotion Picture Association\n(MPA) showed that Filipino consumers who access piracy sites and services are at severe risk of cyber threats, such as identity theft and ransomware.\nThe study found Filipinos are up to 33 times more likely to encounter a cyber threat on the most popular piracy sites compared to legal film and TV websites.\nThese findings were presented in a study released this week during an anti-piracy symposium organized by the Intellectual Property Office of the Philippines (IPOPHL), the Alliance for Creativity and Entertainment (ACE), GMA Network, Inc. and Globe Telecom.\nYour subscription could not be saved.

IPOPHL is still hopeful to see a site-blocking law passed soon.\u201d\nThe MPA\u2019s experience in almost 60 countries around the world shows that site blocking is one of the most effective tools in their toolbox to combat piracy, said Karyn Temple, senior executive vice president and global general counsel for the MPA.\n\u201cThis is particularly true in jurisdictions like the Philippines, where the most visited sites are run by operators based elsewhere in the world,\u201d Temple said.\n\u201cThe enactment of site blocking legislation is the next key step towards protecting Filipino consumers, content creators, and the creative industry in the Philippines and around the world.\u201d\nThe study also showed that raising consumer awareness and education \u2013 particularly with&nbsp;teens and pre-teens \u2013 is crucial to mitigating the cyber risks associated with piracy sites in the Philippines.\n\u201cThe study confirms what we have long feared about online piracy in the Philippines,\u201d said Joseph Francia, first vice president and head of International Operations for GMA Network, Inc., an ACE member company.\n\u201cIn addition to the negative economic impact to the Filipino entertainment industry, digital piracy has far more serious consequences to the Filipino consumers who are unwittingly exposed to a host of cyberthreats by visiting pirate sites,\u201d Francia said.\n\u201cGMA is committed to continue raising consumer awareness and education on the cyber risks associated with digital piracy.\u201d\n\u201cAt Globe, we believe in a digital world that is safe and empowering for everyone,\u201d said Yoly Cristiano, chief sustainability and corporate communications officer for Globe, an ACE member.\n\u201cThis study underscores the critical need for collaborative action to protect consumers, especially young people, from the hidden dangers of online piracy,\u201d Cristiano said.\n\u201cWe are committed to working with the government and partners like the MPA, ACE and GMA Network to promote responsible digital citizenship and ensure a secure online experience for all Filipinos.\u201d\nThe full report is available&nbsp;\nhere\n.\nWant stories like this delivered straight to your inbox?\nStay informed.

Through the up-to-date and expansive FEP interventions and collaborations, we can help enhance the smallholder farmers\u2019 practices and mindsets, and transform them into empowered agro-entrepreneurs,\u201d said Jollibee Group Chief Sustainability and Public Affairs Officer Pepot Mi\u00f1ana.\nFEP is JGF\u2019s flagship program, empowering smallholder farmers nationwide with holistic interventions designed to transform them into agro-entrepreneurs. Through comprehensive training and development, access to financing, market linkage support, and capacity-building resources, FEP enhances their productivity and equips them with the entrepreneurial skills and mindset needed to thrive in a challenging agricultural landscape. To ensure the successful implementation of FEP in different localities, JGF collaborates with various internal and external stakeholders, including the Jollibee Group procurement and logistics and manufacturing team, government agencies, local implementing partners, academic institutions, international organizations, and local farmer groups.\nContent creators farm tour in Laguna\nOn July 22, agriculture and food content creators visited the farmlands of the AGAP Farmers of Pangil, Laguna (AFAP) and AGAP Farmers of\nMagalolon-Kalayaan, Laguna (AFAM) in the first ever media tour held in the FEP farms of Rizal and Laguna.&nbsp;\nAGAP/AFAM farmers with content creators, joined by the Jollibee Group Corporate Communications and JGF team during the farm tour held on July 22, 2024.\nAFAP and AFAM farmers are members of the microfinance institution Ahon Sa Hirap, Inc. (ASHI), which has been a reliable FEP partner since 2013. ASHI launched the ASHI Grameen Agricultural Program (AGAP) in 2010 to reach more farmers in different areas and organize them into becoming agri-entrepreneurs. In 2022, AGAP became the first group in Luzon to deliver directly to Chowking branches in Laguna. It has delivered 45,000 kilos of mixed vegetables to select Chowking stores. AFAP and AFAM farmers have also delivered mixed vegetables such as cabbage, spring onion, and bell peppers to select Chowking stores in Rizal, Laguna, and Cavite Extension since 2023.\nNational and regional media farm tour in Cebu\nJollibee Group and JGF also organized a farm tour in Cebu on October 16 to highlight the collaboration with Lamac Multi-Purpose Cooperative (LMPC), a trusted FEP local implementing partner since 2013.&nbsp;\nParticipants from national and local media outlets learned about stories of successes in farming and adoption of new and innovative farming technologies from the FEP farmers themselves as they visited three farmlands and the Agro-Enterprise Resource Center (AERC), which LMPC facilitates. Apart from FEP, Jollibee Group also provides opportunities to underprivileged Filipino youth through JGF\u2019s Access, Curriculum, and Employability (ACE) Scholarship Program. The Foundation has strengthened its ACE curriculum in recent years and established several AERCs across the country to help institutionalize the practice of agro-entrepreneurship. LMPC, also a local implementing partner of the scholarship program, has trained 90 ACE scholars on agro-entrepreneurship since 2022.\nRepresentatives from LMPC, JGF, and Jollibee Group Corporate Communications joined the national and local media at the Cebu farm tour on October 16, 2024. Led by the FEP farmers, the participants visited three lettuce and spring onion farms.\n\u201cAs we showcase the inspiring stories of our FEP farmers, we are reminded of the vital role the media plays in bringing awareness to important matters such as this. By shedding light on the challenges faced by Filipino farmers and highlighting the collaborative efforts of various stakeholders to support them, the media helps amplify the impact of initiatives like ours. We sincerely thank our media partners for their commitment to telling these stories and for helping us drive awareness and action towards inclusive growth and sustainable livelihoods,\u201d said Mi\u00f1ana.\nLMPC has started supplying select Jollibee Group brands stores with assorted vegetables like cabbage, carrots, and spring onions in 2014. LMPC farmers have delivered 83,000 kilos of vegetables to the company in 2023 and 42,000 kilos of vegetables as of July 2024.&nbsp;\nMeanwhile, since its inception in 2008, FEP has already accredited 30 farmer groups and have collectively delivered 12 million kilos of fresh vegetables with more than P600 million worth of sales to Jollibee Group.\nAs the Jollibee Group continues to grow and expand its business, the company commits itself to sustaining the FEP, further promoting entrepreneurship, education, and sustainable practices among Philippine farming communities.\nADVT.\nThis article is brought to you by Jollibee Group.\nREAD NEXT\nNew Syria PM says will \u2018guarantee\u2019 all religious g...\nMalibu wildfire grows as thousands still evacuated\nEDITORS' PICK\nJericho Rosales raves over Janine Gutierrez\u2019s calendar girl stint\nP40 per kilo rice now available in more public markets\nPBA: Ginebra crushes Phoenix for back to back wins\nUrgent action needed vs online piracy as Congress session nears end\nAcop: Quad comm uncovers Duterte\u2019s link to \u2018grand criminal enterprise\u2019\nNegros Occidental declares state of calamity after Kanlaon blast\nMOST READ\nComelec exempts 48 projects from election ban\nBar exam 2024: List of successful examinees\n3 schools have highest percentage of passers among first-time bar exam takers\nHouse panel: Ex-president Duterte center of grand criminal enterprise\nFollow\n@FMangosingINQ\non Twitter\n-->\nView comments",

These include corporate and shareholder governance, protection of minority shareholders\u2019 interests, and regulatory quality.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nSingapore and Malaysia topped the list in nearly all categories.\nFEATURED STORIES\nBUSINESS\nMore foreign brands seen coming to PH shores in 2025\nBUSINESS\nGlobal Dominion: Simplifying financing to empower every Filipino\nBUSINESS\nInternational group kicks off infrastructure investment drive for PH\nREAD:&nbsp;\nBargain hunting lifts PSEi back to 6,700\nThe OECD stressed that 411 private enterprises in the Philippines had the potential to go public, which should encourage both the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE) to strengthen measures to make listing more attractive to these firms.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThe minimum criterion for listing on the main board of the PSE is to have an anticipated market capitalization of at least P500 million. Based on the OECD\u2019s study, 55 percent of large unlisted companies meet this requirement.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nAccording to OECD director for financial and enterprise affairs Carmine di Noia, private enterprises are often discouraged by the inaccessibility of public equity markets, and weak enforcement of corporate governance policies.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\n\u201cAlthough the SEC and PSE have taken important steps to improve corporate governance, it remains a key issue to improve investor confidence in the domestic capital market,\u201d OECD said in its report.\nFor example, the Securities Regulation Code prohibits insider trading, or trading of public shares by people with access to nonpublic information, such as mergers and acquisitions. This gives insiders an unfair advantage over ordinary investors and tends to manipulate stock prices. The SEC has previously investigated cases of insider trading.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nFor their part, SEC Commissioner McJill Bryant Fernandez told reporters in a media briefing on Wednesday that they planned to update the Philippine Code of Corporate Governance to factor in OECD\u2019s findings.\nThe report likewise found that the Philippines was the only country in Southeast Asia without state-owned enterprises (SOEs), such as Land Bank of the Philippines and Development Bank of the Philippines, listed on its bourse.\n\u201cThe listing of [SOEs] has significantly contributed to the growth and dynamism of capital markets worldwide,\u201d OECD said.\nIn Singapore, three of its top-listed SOEs account for 27 percent of the Singapore Exchange\u2019s total market capitalization.\nFernandez pointed out, however, that the charters of some SOEs in the country needed to be revised to allow listing.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a need to review the respective charters of these SOEs, whether these [listings] are for national development projects or for charity purposes,\u201d Fernandez said.\nAt the same time, the organization said the number of newly listed firms in the Philippines and the capital raised through initial public offerings have been the lowest in Southeast Asia since 2000.\n\u201cThe listing process is long and suffers from organizational challenges, with requirements being less flexible than in peers,\u201d it said.\nCurrently, listing on the local bourse requires the approval of both the SEC and the PSE.

This is soft power, and it rests on our cultural identity, creative expression, and ecological stewardship.\u201d\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nREAD:\nLegarda cites importance of PH Studies courses\nFEATURED STORIES\nNEWSINFO\nBar exam 2024: List of successful examinees\nNEWSINFO\n3 schools have highest percentage of passers among first-time bar exam takers\nNEWSINFO\nBar exam result 2024: 3,962 passed \u2013 Supreme Court\nLegarda recounted her advocacies and initiatives in advancing the country\u2019s cultural diplomacy, including the Philippines\u2019 historic return to the Venice Biennale in 2015 after a 51-year absence, which she championed as the prime mover. \u201cOur reentry into the Venice Biennale redefined global engagement by centering on human stories and sparking collective action for positive change,\u201d she said.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThe senator also highlighted the Philippines\u2019 forthcoming role as Guest of Honour at the 2025 Frankfurt Book Fair, the world\u2019s largest literary event. Legarda worked tirelessly to secure this prestigious participation, driven by a vision to elevate Filipino ingenuity and storytelling on the global stage. \u201cIf other nations have carved their place on this prestigious stage, why not the Philippines? Why shouldn\u2019t our luminous literary heritage be celebrated alongside the world\u2019s greatest voices?\u201d she shared, emphasizing her belief in the brilliance of the Filipino.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nLegarda shared how the Philippines will showcase the richness of Filipino imagination under the theme, \u201cThe Imagination Peoples the Air,\u201d inspired by Dr. Jose Rizal\u2019s ideals of enlightenment and empowerment. She also reflected on her visit to Wilhelmsfeld, Germany, where Rizal stayed in 1886, and wrote the last chapters of Noli Me Tangere.&nbsp; The four-term shared a significant milestone in cultural diplomacy by announcing that the historic vicarage of Pastor Ullmer in Wilhelmsfeld, Germany\u2014where Dr. Jose Rizal stayed for three months\u2014will soon belong to the Philippines.\nUpon learning that the property was placed on the market, she took decisive steps to secure it for the nation. \u201cThis vicarage stands as a testament to Rizal\u2019s ability to transcend barriers through the brilliance of his mind and the humanity of his spirit amidst a time of oppression and discrimination,\u201d she said. The acquisition ensures that this symbol of Filipino cultural diplomacy will be preserved as a vital connection to the country\u2019s rich heritage.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nBeyond cultural diplomacy, Legarda stressed the strategic role of soft power in driving urgent climate action. A steadfast leader in climate advocacy, she initiated the Manila Call to Action on Climate Change, led the Philippines\u2019 efforts within the Climate Vulnerable Forum (CVF), and played a key role in securing the Paris Agreement.\nLegarda also highlighted her ongoing efforts to address climate challenges, such as advocating for the Senate\u2019s concurrence on the High Seas Treaty and funding key activities leading to the 2025 United Nations Oceans Conference in Nice, France. She expressed pride in the Philippines hosting the Fund for Loss and Damage Board, recognizing the country\u2019s commitment to equity and climate justice.\n\u201cSoft power is anything but soft,\u201d Legarda, the UNDRR Global Champion for Resilience, asserted. \u201cIt reshapes perceptions, transforms societies, and fosters collaboration. When wielded with purpose, it allows us to lead by example and offer the world a model for resilience, sustainability, and harmony.\u201d\nWith her visionary leadership in cultural and climate diplomacy, Legarda continues to redefine how the Philippines navigates and influences the global stage, bridging divides and championing shared aspirations for a sustainable future.\nYour subscription could not be saved.

Frequent typhoons and heightened annual rainfall create ideal breeding grounds for mosquitoes, particularly in vulnerable grassroots communities. From January to October 2024, the Philippines reported 314,785 dengue cases and 3,000 deaths, making it the country with the highest number of cases and fatalities in ASEAN.\nIn an interview, Dr. Florentina Ty, the immediate past President of the Philippine Pediatrics Society (PPS), emphasizes the necessity of proactive dengue prevention strategies.&nbsp;\n\u201cWe must move beyond a \u2018ningas kugon\u2019\n(hardworking or great at first, but eventually, no longer continues what was started.)\napproach of reacting only when outbreaks have escalated, especially at the community level\u2014and instead embed sustained, proactive measures into our healthcare system to combat dengue effectively.\u201d\nFighting with one hand tied behind our backs\nThe Philippines was the first Southeast Asian nation to report a dengue epidemic in 1954. Since then, the country has consistently struggled to curb dengue cases and prevent hundreds of deaths\u2014mostly children\u2014each year. Furthermore, subsequent dengue infections pose a greater risk of developing severe symptoms such as hemorrhagic fever or dengue shock syndrome.\nDespite all this, the Philippines has long been at a disadvantage in fighting dengue. While 24 other nations, including neighboring ASEAN countries like Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand, have successfully classified dengue as a vaccine-preventable disease through comprehensive strategies, the Philippines continues to lag behind.&nbsp;\nThe absence of an FDA-approved dengue vaccine in the country creates a critical gap in its efforts to address this decades-long public health challenge, leaving the nation vulnerable to repeated outbreaks and preventable deaths.\nThe controversy surrounding the previous dengue vaccine has further compounded the issue. While allegations against the first generation of dengue vaccine were ultimately unproven, the politicization of the situation eroded public confidence in vaccines and created a lasting setback for the country\u2019s healthcare system.&nbsp;\nHope for a better tomorrow\nEmerging regional strategies offer a promising blueprint for the Philippines. Through comprehensive public health interventions, neighboring countries like Sri Lanka and Singapore have demonstrated remarkable progress. Sri Lanka, in particular, has dramatically reduced dengue case fatality rates from 5% in 1996 to near-zero levels in 2024.\nHealth experts highlight these nations\u2019 integrated approaches\u2014combining targeted vaccination programs, aggressive vector control measures, and widespread community education\u2014as a model that the Philippines can adopt to address its own dengue burden.\nCentral to this success is the introduction of the second-generation dengue vaccine, which offers renewed hope in the fight against the disease. Already approved in several ASEAN nations, this vaccine overcomes many of its predecessor\u2019s limitations by providing protection regardless of prior exposure to the dengue virus.\n\u201cThe second-generation dengue vaccine has a higher safety profile,\u201d emphasized Dr. Ty. \u201cIt can be administered to patients even without previous exposure to dengue.\u201d\nThe new dengue vaccine, developed using a dengue virus backbone rather than the yellow fever virus used in its predecessors, marks a significant advancement in the fight against all dengue serotypes. Particularly, this vaccine has shown efficacy against dengue type 2 (DENV-2) \u2014the strain responsible for the most severe cases.\nBy eliminating the need for prior screening to determine exposure and addressing the side effects associated with first-generation vaccines, this second-generation vaccine offers a safer, more accessible solution for widespread immunization efforts.&nbsp;\nAchieving zero dengue death\nThe Department of Health\u2019s 5S Preventive Dengue Campaign\u2014Search and Destroy, Self-Protection, Seek Early Consultation, Support Fogging, and Sustain Hydration\u2014remains the cornerstone of dengue prevention in the Philippines.&nbsp;\nHowever, Dr. Ty stressed the critical need for a dedicated champion in each community to proactively monitor grassroots situations, ensuring the sustainability and continuity of initiatives and policies despite changes in leadership. She emphasized that combating dengue effectively requires a collective responsibility and a whole-of-community approach.\nThe Philippine medical community remains steadfast in its commitment to achieving \u201cZero Dengue Deaths by 2030,\u201d which aligns with the World Health Organization\u2019s sustainable development goals. \u201cAchieving zero dengue deaths by 2030 is possible if we work together\u2014other countries have done it,\u201d said Dr. Ty. \u201cBy prioritizing vector control and the possibility of integrating the use of vaccines, we have a stronger chance of reducing dengue cases and reaching zero mortality.\u201d\nDr. Ty also underscored the lessons from the COVID-19 vaccination campaign, which demonstrated how widespread immunization and robust public health strategies can effectively reduce infection rates and save lives. She noted that the success of these campaigns provides a valuable framework for dengue prevention, highlighting the parallel significance of integrating vaccines to complement existing healthcare practices and mitigate disease burdens.\nHealthcare professionals continue the call toward sustainable actions and innovative solutions to combat dengue effectively. Just as neighboring countries have made significant strides in reducing dengue mortality, Filipino healthcare professionals hope for a better future where our communities are safeguarded from the devastating impact of this preventable disease.&nbsp;\nReferences:\n1.&nbsp;\nhttps://www.adva.asia/\ndengue-dashboard/\n2.&nbsp;\nhttps://www.\nprecisionvaccinations.com/\nsecond-gen-dengue-vaccine-\nfound-24-countries-2024-07-29\n3.&nbsp;\nhttps://www.who.int/\nsrilanka/news/detail/14-08-\n2024-sri-lanka-successfully-\nconducts-capacity-building-\nprogram-in-clinical-\nmanagement-of-dengue\u2013for-\nbangladeshi-health-staff#:~:\ntext=Dengue%20is%20a%20public%\n20health,time%20to%200.07%25%\n20in%202023\n4.&nbsp;\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.\ncom/science/article/pii/\nS1477893923000583\n&nbsp;.\nADVT.&nbsp;\nThis article is brought to you by&nbsp; Filipino healthcare.\nREAD NEXT\nBeyond The 5S: Understanding the 2nd generation dengue vaccine...\nPH Embassy mapping out next moves on Harry Roque\u2019s UAE stay\nEDITORS' PICK\nBar exam 2024: List of successful examinees\nNegros Occidental declares state of calamity after Kanlaon blast\nAcop: Quad comm uncovers Duterte\u2019s link to \u2018grand criminal enterprise\u2019\nSOCIAL CLIMATE: Life has shortened\n2025 DepEd budget still tops \u201924 level, Poe clarifies\nPBA: Ginebra crushes Phoenix for back to back wins\nMOST READ\nComelec exempts 48 projects from election ban\nCourt clears model in Julie Ann Rodelas slay, but boyfriend found guilty\n3 schools have highest percentage of passers among first-time bar exam takers\nHouse panel: Ex-president Duterte center of grand criminal enterprise\nFollow\n@FMangosingINQ\non Twitter\n-->\nView comments",

        "content": "Today I digress from my usual weekly political commentaries to call attention to something that has bothered me for quite some time as a former academic. While I am no longer teaching in the classrooms of the universities that I used to be part of, I continue to do mentoring work and provision of technical guidance to various social development initiatives of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) ministries, offices, and agencies.\nMy attention was called to the issue of intellectual dishonesty among college professors lately. A good friend of mine who is still part of the faculty of a state university posted on her social media wall the sad reality (but true) in many local institutions of higher learning, not only in Mindanao but throughout the country.\nThat friend has written several peer-reviewed articles that have been published in local and international journals. She has seen how many professors succumb to the usual line of least resistance, choosing to do shortcut approaches in pursuing intellectual growth. This is the practice of circumventing stringent requirements to design and implement research projects, writing reports on them, and publishing these reports for dissemination to fellow academics. Some action-oriented professors strive to write simpler, more popular versions of their scholarly findings for local and regional policymakers for them to rationalize their development plans and initiatives. In this way, professors\u2019 studies will not just gather dust on library shelves, becoming part of the bulk of studies that have not been read at all.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nSometime back while doing my post-graduate courses at the University of Hawaii, I often heard from my professors this phrase \u201cpublish or perish.\u201d Translating it to millennial lingo, this is the \u201chashtag\u201d for those in academe who want to ensure a tenured faculty position in a university. My professors disclosed they only taught at least two subjects in graduate school, and one undergraduate course. The reason: they were required to undertake research projects in their field of specialization, and the results of these studies should also see publication in reputable, peer-reviewed academic journals. A professor who did not engage in research and publication of her studies is a candidate for being eased out, (\u201cperish\u201d) or erased in the roster of tenured faculty members.\nFEATURED STORIES\nOPINION\nUrgent action needed vs online piracy as Congress session nears end\nOPINION\nLife has shortened\nOPINION\nThe gift of second chances\nSuch an academic requisite is true not only in Western-based universities but also in other Asian reputable institutions of higher learning, like the National University of Singapore, among others. Many Southeast and East Asian universities have already made their mark in terms of producing not only scholarly articles and books but also world-renowned intellectuals whose ideas and overall erudition have influenced many Filipino intellectuals as well.\nHowever, in many local universities, the competition for promotion to the next higher rank for professors is such that only a few determined and highly motivated academics can reach the highest possible rank they can access. One stringent requirement is the number of publications a professor has in her portfolio, and that these publications are certified to be in peer-reviewed, reputable, and widely acknowledged professional journals.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThese are Scopus-certified journals, or publications that are expertly curated with citation database, with \u201cenriched data and linked scholarly literature across a wide variety of disciplines.\u201d This is to differentiate Scopus from \u201cpredatory\u201d research journals that are produced by commercially driven groups of pseudo-academics who prey on those who do not make the grade for Scopus-accredited journals. Publishers of predatory journals require payment from those who cannot make it to Scopus-level journals. Indolent professors succumb to this to show they also have a publication portfolio to meet the required academic rank promotion requirements.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nAnother sad reality (again) faced by professors is being overloaded with teaching work, with professors being burdened with a heavy 21-unit teaching load every semester. This is the required teaching load for full-time faculty, and this translates to teaching seven classes of at least 1.5 hours each within a five-day workweek. The hours of preparing for classes, checking students\u2019 papers and consultation with students are not included here. It also does not include special assignments and designations, especially during the university accreditation process when almost all faculty members and even students are on their toes to look for sources of documentary evidence needed for accreditation.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nOne fellow academic asked me a rhetorical question: Given our heavy teaching loads, how can we find time to do research and publish the results in Scopus journals?\n(To be concluded next week)\nArticle continues after this advertisement\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\nrcguiam@gmail.com\nYour subscription could not be saved.

Its inventions and economic successes are\nthe envy of the globe\n. But the rest of the world needs to do everything in its power to avoid being too dependent on it.\nYour subscription could not be saved.

I agree to the\nTerms of Use\nand acknowledge that I have read the\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nAnd this situation would not have been much different had Harris won.\nThe \u201cAmerica first\u201d approach of Donald Trump has actually been a bipartisan policy. At least since previous president Barack Obama\u2019s policy of\nenergy independence\n, the US has been on a mostly inward-looking quest of maintaining technological supremacy while ending the offshoring of industrial jobs.\nOne of the major choices Trump made in his first term was to accept higher prices for US consumers in order to protect national producers by slapping high tariffs on almost every trading partner.\nADVERTISEMENT\nFor instance, Trump\u2019s 2018 tariffs on washing machines from all over the world mean US consumers have been paying\n12% more\nfor these products.\nPresident Joe Biden \u2013 in certainly a\nmore polite\nway \u2013 then\nincreased\nsome of the Trump tariffs: up to 100% on electric vehicles, 50% on solar cells and 25% on batteries from China.\nAt a time of climate emergency, this was a clear choice to slow down the energy transition in order to protect US manufacturing.\nADVERTISEMENT\nWhile Biden\nsigned a truce\nwith Europe on tariffs, it started a perhaps even more damaging battle by launching a subsidy race.\nThe US Inflation Reduction Act for instance contains\nUS$369 billion\n(\u00a3286 billion) of subsidies in areas such as electric vehicles or renewable energy. And the\nChips Act\ncommitted US$52 billion to subsidise the production of semiconductors and computer chips.\nChina, Europe and the rest of the world\nThis US industrial policy might have been inward-looking, but it has clear consequences for the rest of the world. China, after decades of mostly export-based growth, must now deal with massive problems of\nindustrial overcapacity\n.\nThe country is now trying to encourage more\ndomestic consumption\nand to diversify\nits trading partners\n.\nEurope, despite a very tight budget constraint, spends a lot of money\nin the subsidy race\n. Germany, a country facing sluggish growth and big doubts on its\nindustrial model\n, is committed to matching US subsidies, offering for instance\n\u20ac900 million\n(\u00a3750 million) to Swedish battery makers Northvolt to continue producing in the country.\nAll those subsidies are\nhurting the world economy\nand could have easily financed urgent needs such as the electrification of the\nentire African continent\nwith solar panels and batteries. Meanwhile, China has replaced\nthe US and Europe\nas the largest investor in Africa, following its own interest for natural resources.\nThe incoming Trump mandate might be a chance to fix ideas.\nOne might, for instance, argue that the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and the thousands of deaths and the energy crisis that followed, could have been avoided had the Biden administration been clearer to Russian president Vladimir Putin about the consequences of an invasion, and provided modern weapons to Kyiv before the war.\nBut the blame is mostly on Europe. Credit where it\u2019s due, the strategic problem of becoming too dependent on Russian gas is something Trump had\nclearly warned Germany\nabout during his first mandate.\nThere is a clear path forward: Europe could help China fix its overcapacity problems by negotiating an end to its own tariff war on Chinese technology such as\nsolar panels\nand\nelectric cars\n.\nIn exchange, Europe would regain some sovereignty by producing more of its own clean energy instead of\nimporting record amounts\nof liquid gas from the US. It could also\nlearn a few things\nfrom producing with Chinese companies, and China could use its\nimmense leverage on Russia\nto end the invasion of Ukraine.\nThe European Union could also work harder on what it does best: signing\ntrade deals\n, and using them as a way to\nreduce carbon emissions\naround the world.\nThis is not only about Europe and China. After decades of\ncontinuous improvement\non all major dimensions of human life, the world is moving backwards.\nThe number of people facing hunger is increasing, taking us back to\nthe levels of 2008-9\n.

Photo by TED ALJIBE / Agence France-Presse\nThe Asian Development Bank (ADB) plans to invest as much as $100 billion in climate-related projects by 2030, highlighting how fighting climate change ranks high on its development agenda.\n\u201cThe vision for ADB is to be the Climate Bank for the Asia and the Pacific region,\u201d said Ramesh Subramaniam, Director General and Group Chief of the Sectors Group at ADB.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve allotted $100 billion in cumulative commitments to be reached by 2030. We also have more funds that have been approved, and a significant portion of that will go [towards addressing] climate change,\u201d he said during the recent Girls Takeover event.\nREAD:\nADB prepares $500-M policy loan to boost PH fiscal modernization\nSubramaniam said that the Asia Pacific region performed well despite the pandemic with the middle class in the developing economies continuing to expand.\nThis growth, however, has accelerated global warming that has spurred worsening environmental disasters such as more frequent and severe typhoons and longer droughts.\nThese underscore the urgent need to invest in mitigation and adaptation measures to achieve climate goals.\n\u201cAll of us clearly need to play a very strong role in protecting nature. Not just protecting nature, but we also need to value nature and address climate change at all levels,\u201d he said.\nYouth power\nHe added that in many communities, societies and countries, young people, including girls and young women were more aware of the perils of climate change and are eager to contribute to achieving climate goals.\nThese include keeping global warming to 1.5 degrees over pre-industrial levels. Failure to do so means a higher risk of unleashing more severe impacts, including more frequent and severe heatwaves, droughts and rainfall.\nRecently, the ADB formally partnered with Plan International, a global humanitarian and development organization, to showcase the critical role girls and young women play in leading climate action.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nDuring the event last month, youth leaders from across Asia and the Pacific, along with civil society organizations discussed and explored innovative nature-based solutions to climate change, as well as recognized the unique contributions of girls and young women in building climate-resilient communities.\nFEATURED STORIES\nBUSINESS\nMore foreign brands seen coming to PH shores in 2025\nBUSINESS\nGlobal Dominion: Simplifying financing to empower every Filipino\nBUSINESS\nInternational group kicks off infrastructure investment drive for PH\n\u201cThe climate crisis is a social and intergenerational injustice; those who have contributed least are often the most impacted.

Most of these libraries are managed by the offices of the heads of local government units (LGUs), while other libraries are managed by various national and local government offices such as the National Library of the Philippines, Public Information Office, and local Tourism and Cultural Affairs agencies. A few more libraries in the country are under the management of civil society organizations or private or nonprofit organizations.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThe report also highlighted that while many libraries fall under the supervision of LGUs, they often lack the necessary resources and support to sustain the library\u2019s operations. The NLP said there may be a need to clarify the role of public libraries in local government plans to help improve their sustainability and effectiveness in serving local communities.\nFEATURED STORIES\nNEWSINFO\nBar exam 2024: List of successful examinees\nNEWSINFO\n3 schools have highest percentage of passers among first-time bar exam takers\nNEWSINFO\nBar exam result 2024: 3,962 passed \u2013 Supreme Court\nREAD:\nThe library\u2019s place in a democracy\nAnother study, the National Book Development Board 2023 Readership Survey, found that only 18 percent of the surveyed adults and 12 percent of the surveyed children were aware of public libraries within their cities or municipalities. Of these, only 51 percent of adults and 60 percent of children reported having visited these libraries.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nWe talked to four such libraries\u2014two public and two independent ones\u2014to learn about the common challenges they face, how they work to help shape and empower their communities, and how these avenues for public learning can continue to play a role in national education, literacy, and community-building.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nQuezon City Public Library\nAs the highly urbanized home to a wide array of government offices, vocational schools, and educational institutions, including the main campuses of the University of the Philippines-Diliman and Ateneo de Manila University, and also among the wealthiest cities in the country, Quezon City has taken the right course of maintaining and supporting an active library for its residents.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nWith around 32 branch libraries spread across the districts of Quezon City, including its main hub in City Hall, the Quezon City Public Library provides various activities for its many visitors. The main library continues to find ways to foster literacy and learning, such as conducting reading tutorials for students.\nMariza Chico, the officer in charge of the Quezon City Public Library, said over 699 beneficiaries have benefited from program, which this year finally saw a standardized model for tutorials.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\n\u201cPublic libraries serve as a source of credible information and a free force in developing literacy in communities,\u201d said Chico. \u201cAs a center of information, public libraries not only provide equitable access to library materials, but also programs and activities that elevate the literacy level of people belonging to a particular community, especially those who are underserved.\u201d\nChico, who became officer in charge in 2020, recounted how even during the pandemic, the library was able to keep its community alive through the efforts of its staff and by providing online services such as tutorials and digital resources.\nPASSION FOR CULTURE, LETTERS IN LA UNION The Alfredo F. Tadiar Library, once the residence of the Tadiar family (left, top photo), now stands as a testament to its rich history, offering a space for various community activities and cultural events. \u2014Photos from Alfredo F. Tadiar Library Facebook and Instagram accounts\nDeveloping a digitized library is ongoing, said Chico, to enable the institution to adapt to the fast-changing technological environment and to bring the benefits of the library\u2019s resources to many more constituents.\nVisit QC Public Library FB page, email qcplibrary@quezoncity.gov.ph, or visit Gate 3 City Hall Compound, Diliman, Quezon City, 1100 Metro Manila.\nSentro ng Karunungan Library\nLocated in Tutuban Center Mall in Tondo, Manila, is the Sentro ng Karunungan Library, one of the affiliated public libraries of the National Library of the Philippines.\nOn the mall\u2019s third floor, past the shops and restaurants down below, the library is a quaint, quiet space with tables and desks for private reading and discussion, shelves of books and periodicals, and a coffee nook for visitors who would like to stay a little longer.\nAfter moving to its current location from an old facility in Tayuman, the library now focuses on providing a space for relaxation and learning for all sorts of visitors, from children with special needs to out-of-school youth. The library also offers digital literacy classes for senior citizens.\nDarwin Besorio, who started working at the library in 2018 and currently serves as the librarian in charge, wants Sentro to become the go-to review center for students and a sanctuary of other learning resources aside from books.\nCATCHING UP ON TECH The main Quezon City Public Library near City Hall is currently taking steps to become a rich source of both printed and digitized materials. \u2014Erin Alcala\n\u201cStudents, out-of-school youth, senior citizens, children, and even informal settlers, they can all come to the library,\u201d said Besorio, who recalled the challenging times they had promoting the library. The staff handed out flyers and visited schools to spread the word, and these days harness social media to continue to make the library present in the minds of readers and visitors.\n\u201cI\u2019m fighting for the library,\u201d said Besorio. \u201cFor whatever it can give back to the community.\u201d\nVisit Sentro ng Karunungan Library FB page, email sentrongkarununganlibrary2007@gmail.com, call 0966-2640944, or visit 3F, TMX, Prime Block, Tutuban Center Mall, Tondo, Recto Avenue, Manila.\nTanggew: Community Library, Eco-Cultural Learning, and Resource Center\nThe Tanggew: Community Library, Eco-Cultural Learning, and Resource Center was born out of countless cups of coffee and spirited discussions among a group of passionate individuals committed to making a difference in their community.\nEstablished in 2019 in Northern Sagada, Mountain Province, this community library was created to serve as a vibrant hub for learning, cultural exchange, and community empowerment. With 46 community volunteers, ranging from children to adults, Tanggew promotes collaboration and knowledge-sharing through various activities such as the Read Aloud Program and the establishment of community book pantries.\nAlma Toyoken, chair of Tanggew, said the initiative is focused on reviving the spirit of volunteerism in an era dominated by capitalism. At the heart of this vision is a deep commitment for the well-being of the communities in Northern Sagada and other indigenous communities of Mountain Province.\nRICH BREW FOR THE MIND A cup of coffee can make a good book even better. At Sentro ng Karunungan Library, visitors can take their pick among various blends in sachets. \u2014Erin Alcala\nTanggew is temporarily housed in one of the oldest homes in Barangay Bangaan, Sagada. The library\u2019s resources are supported by partnerships with organizations like Library Hub Philippines and with local community members.\nAside from using books as resources, Tanggew is looking to develop the concept of a human library, where older Sagada residents are treated as \u201cliving books\u201d or oral historians who can share their firsthand knowledge of the region\u2019s culture, history, and traditions.\nVisit Tanggew Community Library FB page, call 0915 -0282225, or visit House No. 189, Barangay Bangaan, Sagada, Mountain Province.\nAlfredo F. Tadiar Library\nTo honor Alfredo F. Tadiar, a lawyer, educator, and a pioneer in alternative dispute resolution in the Philippines, his daughter, Neferti Tadiar, converted their family home into a library as a lasting tribute to her father\u2019s legacy and commitment to education.\nFounded in 2017, the Alfredo F. Tadiar Library (AFTL) is an independent research and resource center in San Fernando, La Union. When it first opened, Neferti said the response was overwhelming, particularly from young creative individuals who expressed their longing for this type of space in the area.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know there was that demand [for the library], that young people were looking for this,\u201d she said. Neferti, also an educator, now serves as director of the AFTL.\nLike Tanggew, AFTL is supported by a dedicated group of volunteers. They organize regular community discussions and events, helping foster a vibrant, collaborative environment. AFTL also regularly hosts book launches, art exhibitions, and public forums, offering a platform for local artists and writers to share their work and engage with the community.\nSHELF LIFE (From left) Inside the Tanggew: Community Library, Eco-Cultural Learning, and Resource Center; Quezon City Public Library; and Sentro ng Karunungan Library. \u2014Photos from Tanggew: Community Library, Eco-cultural Library, Learning and Resource Center facebook page and Erin Alcala\nThe library\u2019s strong social media engagement has helped it attract a diverse range of visitors, from locals and seasonal tourists to international guests. Its well-curated collection includes an extensive Filipiniana collection, making it a valuable resource for researchers and scholars.\nSaid Neferti: \u201cLibraries change people and empower people, because they give information [that allows] them to decide for themselves and to learn their own histories.\u201d\nYour subscription could not be saved.

        "content": "The gap between the generations arises because the young person looks at the future, the middle-aged person looks at the present and the old person looks at the past.\u201d \u2014Professor M.S. Rao\nThe theory offered by authors William Strauss and Neil Howe can partially explain why Rao\u2019s statement holds. They introduced the concept of generational identities, suggesting that people born within a specific era were shaped by common historical events, societal attitudes and values. These collective experiences led to shared beliefs and behaviors, giving rise to distinct identities shared by generational groups.\nThe world today is a complicated \u201cmess.\u201d We live in an era where knowledge abounds and where technological advancements are fast and furious, such that what used to be science fiction is now part of our routine and ordinary living.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nYet, it is when times are turbulent that we need a solid pillar to hang on to or risk being swept away and drown in nothingness, like an uprooted tree. True, the circumstances where our ancestors lived are different from ours, and that is the reason why we must strengthen institutional and cultural memories so that our identities remain connected and become the shoulders we stand upon as civilization progresses.\nFEATURED STORIES\nBUSINESS\nMore foreign brands seen coming to PH shores in 2025\nBUSINESS\nGlobal Dominion: Simplifying financing to empower every Filipino\nBUSINESS\nInternational group kicks off infrastructure investment drive for PH\nThese generational identities should be harnessed to combine the strengths of each to make every generation better than the one that went before. We focus on the threads that connect rather than on the differences that divide.\nIntergenerational collaboration has the rich potential for building a more sustainable and inclusive future. Harmonizing the advantages every generation brings, blending the wisdom and experience of older generations with the innovation and technological savvy of younger ones, can help build more resilient organizations, communities, and societies.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nWhat superpowers are brought to the table by these generations?\nArticle continues after this advertisement\n\u2022 The Silent Generation\u2019s (1928-1945) experience and resilience rooted in the post-war era, and their values of discipline, loyalty and responsibility can provide a stabilizing influence in today\u2019s fast-paced world.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\n\u2022 The Baby Boomers (1946-1964), who secured leadership roles, created established networks and are used to arduous work, have the willingness to mentor younger generations and can help bridge the gap between the old and new ways of thinking.\n\u2022 Generation X (1965-1980) are characterized by their adaptability and that lessened the pain points of technological transitions, effectively bridging the analog and digital worlds. They can serve as role models who can balance traditional values with modern approaches.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\n\u2022 The Generation Y or Millennials (1981-1996), who quickly became digital immigrants, are comfortable with technology, yet equally focused on work-life balance and purpose-driven work. Their entrepreneurial spirit and social consciousness can drive innovation and social change.\n\u2022 The Generation Z or Gen Zs (1997-2012) are digital natives and strong advocates of diversity, activism and their push for transparency, inclusivity and sustainability. Their influence can now be felt on markets through new consumption patterns and in organizations through their redefinition of workplace and influencing work conditions.\nImpact on business, workplace and markets\nThe Generation Alpha (2013-present) who are born and growing up in an entirely digital world stand to benefit from the fruits of this intergenerational collaboration. Their collective strengths can develop the agility, creativity and environmental consciousness for this upcoming generation. The collective experiences are shared memories that strengthen their roots and fortify their foundation and those coming next.\nToday and in the future, the different generations shape market trends\u2014from the Silent Generation\u2019s brand loyalty to Gen Z\u2019s preference for ethical consumption and instant gratification. They are the multi-generational workforce requiring a changed workplace dynamic and needing right-fit communication styles to foster a culture of inclusion. Companies need to leverage generational diversity and factor this in product/service development to ensure they meet the needs of a wide demographic.\nBuilding a sustainable future\nTechnology has the potential to bring these generations together, from digital literacy programs for older adults to intergenerational tech start-ups focused on solving global challenges.\nOlder generations can impart wisdom so that the younger ones can enjoy the benefits of structured mentorship and in the process acquire fresh perspectives, manage learning curves and use digital skills more effectively. All generations in a constant state of collaboration can drive sustainability initiatives, from policy advocacy by the more senior ones to grassroots activism led by younger groups.\nThey say that history repeats itself\u2014or as George Santayana aptly puts it, \u201cThose who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.\u201d\nThe times we live in today are filled with astounding discoveries and the advancement of knowledge is rapid; but other than these physical manifestations, has the world really changed? Maybe because we tend to forget the past and are only concerned about the present.\nThe philosophy of passages that should have been taught from generation to generation are the value anchors that make for a just and humane society. While the world changes, the values are constant.\nRespect, integrity, honesty \u2014these should be part of our core foundation because they will make the individuals and the society stable and unshaken despite turbulence and disruptions.\nThese values define our choices\u2014knowing and showing respect means doing the right thing for individuals and institutions; having integrity will not allow one to benefit at the expense of others; and when there is honesty, one cannot be lured by the call of greed and corruption\u2014and therefore, all three value anchors can enable the best outcomes.\nHierarchical authorities, while they provide stability and structure, are learning that to be effective, to get the results they want, they must learn to listen, be comfortable working with teams and individuals across multiple generations and be more open to share power and use the benefits it brings to build a better world.

French boasts 300 million speakers across 106 countries and territories, with 132 million learners worldwide. With 235 million people using it daily, it ranks as the fifth most spoken language globally and serves as the official language in 29 countries and governments among the 88 members of the International Organisation of La Francophonie (OIF).\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nCreated on March 20, 1970, in Niamey, Niger, the OIF is a unique organization, rich in diversity, which promotes not only the French language but also political, educational, economic, and cultural cooperation among its member countries. This spirit of cohesion built around the French language is reflected in the work of key figures such as L\u00e9opold S\u00e9dar Senghor. He was a Senegalese poet, philosopher, and politician who served as the first president of Senegal from 1960 to 1980. His legacy reverberates through the history of Francophonie, from its roots to its contemporary political dimension. Through his eloquent speeches, Senghor highlighted the importance of French as a language of universal civilization, emphasizing its role in shaping the identity and culture of Francophone peoples. His advocacy for Francophonie as a cultural community that transcends political boundaries laid the groundwork for international cooperation based on linguistic and cultural sharing.\nFEATURED STORIES\nOPINION\nUrgent action needed vs online piracy as Congress session nears end\nOPINION\nLife has shortened\nOPINION\nThe gift of second chances\nThus, Francophonie, much like the linguistic and cultural diversity of the Philippines, embodies a political and ideological vision of a world unified in the richness of its languages and cultures. Similar to the ideal of the OIF, the Philippines is a treasure trove of linguistic and cultural richness. With a plethora of languages spoken across its diverse islands, including over 170 regional and local dialects, the Philippines stands as a testament to unity and diversity.\nAlthough not a member of the OIF, the Philippines holds a promising outlook for the French language. With a positive image and growing opportunities in industries such as services, business process outsourcing, and student mobility, French enjoys a favorable position. Key players such as the Alliance Fran\u00e7aise in Manila and Cebu, prominent universities like the University of the Philippines and Ateneo de Manila, and the association of French teachers contribute significantly to French language education and promotion. Each year, these cultural organizations in charge of promoting the French language and culture enable around 4,000 Filipinos to learn French.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThe Department of Education is also an active partner in that field. Since 2009, it has included French in the curriculum of 12 science high schools in the National Capital Region (NCR) and Region VII. During the academic year 2022-2023, these schools have witnessed the training of more than 1,600 pupils in these regions.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nFrancophonie Week in the Philippines. During Francophonie Week 2024, francophone ambassadors prepared an array of diverse initiatives to celebrate French language and culture.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nRepresentatives from each country produced videos highlighting athletes from their country participating in the Paris 2024 Olympic or Paralympic Games, emphasizing their inspiring stories and sporting values. Visits were organized to two NCR high schools where French is taught (Makati Science High School and Quezon City Science High School), allowing diplomats to interact directly with students and educators. A lively karaoke event took place in Makati on March 20, Francophonie Day, to welcome French-speaking ambassadors, Department of Foreign Affairs representatives, university students, and teachers. Furthermore, the Alliance Fran\u00e7aise de Manille hosted screenings of French language films from Romania, Swiss, Canada, and Morocco, offering audiences captivating cinematic experiences. Francophonie Summit in Villers-Cotter\u00eats. The next Francophonie Summit is scheduled for October 2024 in France, in the castle of Villers-Cotter\u00eats. It is set to commence on Oct. 4 at the Cit\u00e9 internationale de la langue fran\u00e7aise, a venue dedicated to French language and Francophone cultures, inaugurated by French President Emmanuel Macron on Oct. 30, 2023. This castle hosted in 1539 the signature of the ordinance declaring French the official language of all legal documents in France.

Porcelain, silk and various spices made their way to the Philippines via the Manila Galleon trade starting at Quanzhou, a crucial hub in the ancient Maritime Silk Road.\nFEATURED STORIES\nBUSINESS\nMore foreign brands seen coming to PH shores in 2025\nBUSINESS\nGlobal Dominion: Simplifying financing to empower every Filipino\nBUSINESS\nInternational group kicks off infrastructure investment drive for PH\nPer a quick history from Wilson Flores, Federation of Filipino Chinese Chambers of Commerce and Industry, Inc. (FFCCCII) board member, the wave of Chinese migration, which began in the 19th century, was triggered by the \u201ccorrupt and bad governance of the late Qing Dynasty, combined with Western and Japanese colonial wars and Opium Wars, causing the once rich Chinese empire to suffer economically.\u201d\nLIVING FOSSIL Three Lanes and Seven Alleys in Fuzhuo was once a residential block where intellectuals, politicians and anyone of importance lived Photos by Ira Pedrasa.\nGeographical proximity lured a number of ethnic Chinese from Fujian to cross the seas and settle in the Philippines. Quoting the \u201cChristmas in Our Hearts\u201d singer, whose late father was sugar tycoon Antonio Chan, Flores says they were \u201cthe first overseas workers.\u201d\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nFlores, who acquired and restored the 85-year-old Kamuning Bakery, says his own forebears were from Fujian.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nElephant in the room\nAgainst this backdrop, the FFCCCII hosted a three-city familiarization trip in Fujian for a number of journalists that began in Xiamen early this month. Indeed, the conflict raging over the West Philippine Sea was not lost on anyone, including this author, but calmed by an almost familiar setting replete with Filipino culture and traditions\u2014that, perhaps, showcase that there are no distinctions to be set aside.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\n\u201cFujian people have been having business with the Philippines since more than a thousand years ago. They know our country and they have had intermarriages with our people, so that they are more comfortable with us,\u201d says George Chua Cham, FFCCCII government liaison committee chair, whose ancestors also hail from the China province.\n\u201cIt seems these controversial border disputes came about only in modern times, especially with the onset of colonialism. In the past, fisherfolk, traders and seafarers of all nations interacted with each other without passports, with the vast expanse of the sea actually uniting them in camaraderie, kinship and brotherhood,\u201d adds Flores.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nCROWNING GLORY A tiny shop near Kaiyuan Temple in Quanzhou offers traditional wear for rent, including this headpiece, to tourists. The belief is that when one wears a floral crown, called Zanhuawei, \u201cin this life, you\u2019ll also be pretty in the afterlife.\u201d\nFrom Xiamen airport, a mall with an all-too-familiar logo of the SM group greets guests upon their entry into the city. Manicured gardens and parks are found in every corner, as a major highway provides unobstructed view of the sea, a la Manila Bay.\nIn early December, temperature usually drops to the mid-teens\u2014just the right formula for a long walk for those accustomed to the tropics. Around the same time this year, Beijing had to endure its longest cold wave in modern history.\nAccording to Fujian officials interviewed, aside from the weather, Filipinos will take a liking to the connectivity that the city and the province, in general, have to offer.\nInterprovince, a bullet train will cut by more than half passengers\u2019 travel time to Fuzhou, the provincial capital, to just over an hour. The CR Fuxing is only the third fastest train in the world, with the first two also belonging to China.\nTHIRD FASTEST TRAIN At a speed of 350 kilometers per hour, the CR Fuxing is just the third fastest in the world. The first and second spots also belong to China.\nRunning at a speed of 350 kilometers per hour, a seat by the window gives a spectacular\u2014at times dizzying\u2014alternate views of the sea, tree-lined mountains and buildings of various shapes and sizes. It\u2019s a showcase of how the Fujian government would describe its advantage over the more popular cities of China: the province offers \u201cmarine culture, ecological civilization and multiculturalism.\u201dA crisscross of modern and ancient\nAside from the rich cuisine\u2014think oyster omelette, spring rolls, fish balls and an array of soup varieties (including \u2018Buddha Jumps Over the Wall,\u2019 a collagen-filled soup of abalone, sea cucumber and various meats so-called because even Buddha would be tempted to splurge on it)\u2014on offer, Fujian also provides an ancient vibe that can easily comingle with the modern.\nSanFangQiXiang, or the Three Lanes and Seven Alleys in Fuzhou, is an Instagram-ready residential block regarded by scholars as a \u201cliving fossil of ancient city street system.\u201d Once an area that housed intellectuals and officials of important standing in the Ming and Qing dynasties, it is now a major tourist spot with a side street offering various curios and food.\nA stone\u2019s throw away is Lin Zexu Memorial, a mix of temple and museum in remembrance of China\u2019s anti-opium hero, whose policies precipitated the Opium War and continued to inspire modern China\u2019s endeavors in the narcotics war.\nNOT TIRESOME One of two five-story pagodas that flank Kai- yuan Temple in Quanzhou, a crucial port on the ancient Mari- time Silk Road, where various beliefs and religions flourished.\nA consistent theme in China\u2019s history is perhaps the pride that its peoples have grown to evolve with in response to subjugation and humiliation over the centuries.\nNot only in Fujian, Luckin outlets are now scattered across China. It was the country\u2019s response to the dominance of Starbucks, which currently numbers around 6,000 versus the homegrown coffee brand\u2019s 10,000 branches.\nIn Quanzhou, which is two hours by bus from Fuzhou, a museum houses the 32-year-old history of Anta, the country\u2019s biggest sportswear company and the world\u2019s third largest in terms of market capitalization (next only to Nike and Adidas). Founded in Fujian, Anta has gained popularity in recent years after signing up big names in world sports while tapping a burgeoning predilection among the young for anything homegrown rooted in national pride.\nPH hero in China\n\u201cMulticulturalism\u201d is another big theme in Fujian\u2019s tourism banner.\nNOT LUNETA The tallest Rizal monument, at 18.61 meters representing the Philippine hero\u2019s birth year, can be found in Jinjiang, Quanzhou.\nWhere else is this most reflected than in Quanzhou, one of the most important ports in the Maritime Silk Road, a sea route that modern China wants to revisit through its Belt and Road Initiative.\nWowing the likes of explorers Marco Polo and Ibn Battuta, Quanzhou was an important trading hub that allowed various religions and beliefs to flourish.\nEven FFCCCII\u2019s Cham could only quip they had no concept of racism and discrimination in those days. A tombstone unearthed in recent years showed Buddha with angel wings and a mix of other religious elements, such as Hinduism surrounding it. Meanwhile, in the middle of the city is a 1,000-year-old mosque built for Muslim traders and not far from it is the Taoist temple, Guandi.\nFilipinos will also do a double take when they visit Rizal Park in Zhangguo village also in Quanzhou for its similarities to the one in Manila. The Fujian monument commemorates the Philippine hero while acknowledging his Chinese connection. Rizal\u2019s great-grandfather was Domingo Lam-co (Chinese name: Ke Yinan) who adopted the surname Mercado.\nA case for Mandarin\nBack in Fuzhou, about 50 Filipino students and teachers are studying Mandarin at 116-year-old Fujian Normal University. Some have been living in China for a couple of years now and are supported by the FFCCCII.\nLindsey Reyes, who hails from Bataan, believes studying the language will be a big advantage when she graduates. \u201cKnowing a foreign language is an advantage, what more if it\u2019s Mandarin?\u201dReyes and her companions say the language will make Filipinos more competitive in an increasingly globalized world. Knowledge of the language also becomes an imperative with China\u2019s growing impact across economies.\nIn the Philippines, teachers who can teach Mandarin are few and far between. While a campaign for the inclusion of Mandarin in the curriculum has yet to take root, students like Reyes will have to content themselves with scholarships that will allow them to \u201cgive back\u201d to their mother country in the near future.\nAdjusting in a foreign country like China was not difficult for Christian Dayson of Pampanga. He was more surprised that all his perceptions of China were shattered when he started studying there.\n\u201cTheir personalities are not that different from Pinoys. Like us, they are very much willing when we need help,\u201d he says.\nAs run-ins on disputed waters continue, so too must trade and cultural exchanges, according to Cham. Fujian today also remains a commercial center of trade for Filipino products such as durian, banana chips and other agricultural products.\nBased on data from the Fujian government, exports to the Philippines grew 16 percent in 2021 to $10.43 billion, while imports increased almost 41 percent to $1.2 billion in the same year.\nTRAFFIC-FREE Xiamen\u2019s roads are free of heavy traffic even at peak hours due to pedestrian-friendly sidewalks and e-bikes scattered all over the city, ready for renting using e-wallets.\nFFCCCII president Cecilio Pedro says it\u2019s high time for a \u201creset\u201d in Philippine-China relations in the direction of \u201cmore cooperation and dialogues.\u201d\nIn a follow-up email correspondence with the Inquirer, the Fujian government says the dispute at sea is \u201crooted in the intersection of history, law and geopolitics, and there is currently no universally accepted solution.\u201d\nYour subscription could not be saved.

Exchanges between the two cultures can also promote cultural diversity and the protection of cultural heritage. Exchanges and cooperation between the two peoples can promote mutual understanding and friendship, help ease political tensions, and provide a solid social foundation for the stability and development of bilateral relations.\u201d\nINQ\nREAD NEXT\nHog raisers brace for slow recovery\nGov\u2019t spending slowdown shrank Nov budget gap\nEDITORS' PICK\nGlow all out: Sparkly makeup to welcome the New Year\nComelec exempts 48 projects from election ban\nUS developing topical vaccine that you rub on the skin\nBuilding a league of their own with the WMPBL\nEnforce discount laws,&nbsp;commuters tell LTFRB\nCourt clears model in Julie Ann Rodelas slay, but boyfriend found guilty\nMOST READ\nComelec exempts 48 projects from election ban\nBar exam 2024: List of successful examinees\n3 schools have highest percentage of passers among first-time bar exam takers\nCourt clears model in Julie Ann Rodelas slay, but boyfriend found guilty\nFollow\n@FMangosingINQ\non Twitter\n-->\nView comments",

        "content": "Humanity is still figuring out artificial intelligence (AI), and our worries about this strange new technology, while warranted, stem largely from the fear of the unknown. At the heart of our collective anxiety is the idea that people, for all their talent and ingenuity, will someday be replaced by an object of their own creation far more talented and ingenious than they can ever hope to be.\nThis fear will only grow over time as machine learning becomes more and more adept at simulating (or appropriating) human knowledge, engendering questions that once belonged only in the realm of science fiction: Will AI achieve sentience? Is any job safe from a takeover by machines? Can AI overrun civilization?\nBut even such existential crises-in-the-making barely touch the tip of the iceberg. We have yet to truly confront the malevolent prospects that AI brings. Think of dictators tapping AI to influence elections, smear opponents and spy on foreign governments. Or cybercriminals using it to develop sophisticated social engineering and phishing techniques. Or terrorists making use of AI to invent new pathogens to attack populations. Or AI-generated deepfakes being used to spread disinformation, instigating conflict and chaos the world over.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nTo a great extent, some of these scenarios are already occurring even without AI assistance, but imagine how deep-learning algorithms can accelerate our descent into such a post-truth dystopian hell.\nFEATURED STORIES\nOPINION\nUrgent action needed vs online piracy as Congress session nears end\nOPINION\nLife has shortened\nOPINION\nThe gift of second chances\nOn the flip side, AI brings with it an alluring promise. World leaders believe AI can put an end to some of the enduring ills afflicting the globe, via \u201cnew knowledge, new opportunities for economic growth, new advances in human capability, and the chance to solve global problems we once thought beyond us,\u201d as British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak wrote in a commentary that appeared on this page on Oct. 30.\n\u201cAI can help solve world hunger by preventing crop failures and making it cheaper and easier to grow food. It can help accelerate the transition to net zero. And it is already making extraordinary breakthroughs in health and medicine, aiding us in the search for new dementia treatments and vaccines for cancer,\u201d he said.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThe possibilities are endless in either direction, but whether AI will be a force of good or evil ultimately depends on what our government is going to do to mitigate the risks, while exacting immense gain from it\u2014a tall order for a country that is still struggling against online attacks and data breaches.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nOn Nov. 1, the Philippines joined 27 other nations and the European Union in signing the Bletchley Declaration during the AI Safety Summit organized by the United Kingdom.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nAmong other objectives, the signatories resolved to \u201cwork together in an inclusive manner to ensure human-centric, trustworthy and responsible AI that is safe,\u201d and support \u201cthe good of all through existing international fora and other relevant initiatives, to promote cooperation to address the broad range of risks posed by AI.\u201d\nBeyond signing this pact, however, the Philippine government has yet to devote any meaningful attention to AI regulation. In May 2021, the Department of Trade and Industry launched an ambitious national roadmap to hasten AI adoption in the country with the goal of becoming an AI powerhouse in the region. But not much progress has been made since.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nSix House bills and two Senate resolutions on AI concerns have been filed, but with little traction among lawmakers to pursue them, and zero prodding from the executive branch.\nTo date, we have heard of only a few localized solutions for AI, such as guidelines by the University of the Philippines to prevent cheating through apps like ChatGPT, as well as the Supreme Court\u2019s plans to use AI tools to streamline court processes.\nInformation and Communications Technology Secretary Ivan John Uy has warned that AI could deal a catastrophic blow to our labor force. \u201cWithout proper regulation from the government, it could become dangerous, it could become destructive as it evolves. And it\u2019s evolving very, very fast,\u201d he said in June.\nBut we are more interested in hearing his proposed solutions. What strategies are our officials forming in the face of this looming threat? Are there even any?\nTime is of the essence because, in the absence of a clear policy direction, we risk being caught flat-footed as AI disrupts production chains and industries in the blink of an eye, from finance and health care to agriculture, logistics\u2014and even the arts and media communications.\nIn September, GMA unveiled its first AI sportscasters on air.

        "content": "The World Economic Forum\u2019s 14th Annual Meeting of the New Champions (AMNC23) brought together influential leaders, entrepreneurs and innovators from around the globe on June 27 to June 29.Also known as the \u201cSummer Davos Forum,\u201d AMNC23 was held in Tianjin, People\u2019s Republic of China, with the theme \u201cEntrepreneurship: The Driving Force of the Global Economy.\u201d The annual meeting aims to foster collaborative efforts in addressing the critical geopolitical and geoeconomic challenges facing humanity\u2014such as sustainable energy transition, internet of things (IoT) security and safeguarding nature and climate.\nIn the opening ceremony, Chinese Premier Li Qiang emphasized the need for communication, cooperation and openness to sustain economic globalization and global supply chain stability. He highlighted China\u2019s major contributions to global economic growth\u2014being the first in the world for goods trading in six consecutive years\u2014and outlined China\u2019s commitment to innovation, sustainability and global cooperation to aid world economic recovery.\nThis year\u2019s topics centered on key issues that have the potential to either transform or derail economies and societies worldwide.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nA debt crisis for developing countries\nSoaring global debt and rising interest rates are forcing governments worldwide to divert funding from important development goals, such as education and climate change. The issue is exacerbated in developing countries that are forced to get credit at very high interest rates.\nFEATURED STORIES\nBUSINESS\nMore foreign brands seen coming to PH shores in 2025\nBUSINESS\nGlobal Dominion: Simplifying financing to empower every Filipino\nBUSINESS\nInternational group kicks off infrastructure investment drive for PH\nGlobal debt hit $305 trillion in previous months due to compounding shocks, such as COVID-19 and the war in Ukraine. Developing countries, in particular, saw external debt levels grow by over 15 percent last year compared with prepandemic levels. The interest cost on external borrowing is, on average, three times more for developing countries than for developed countries, resulting in developing countries using a far greater percentage of their domestic revenue on interest payments.\nAt the Summer Davos Forum, political and economic leaders called for better coordination and communication among major world economies to help curb the global debt crisis. Experts stressed that governments, the private sector and international financial institutions like the International Monetary Fund need to create new funding mechanisms. International lenders were also urged to increase access to long-term public financing and improve market borrowing terms for developing countries.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThe need for AI guardrails and responsible design\nAt the Summer Davos forum, experts agreed that artificial intelligence (AI) models are powerful, creative technology that could change human civilization. One session discussed AI\u2019s potential to revolutionize health care by improving medical diagnosis, health-care delivery and clinical trial selections. A report was also shared about the success of FireAId, a pilot initiative that uses AI to predict wildfires with 80 percent accuracy rate.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nForums discussed the need for a framework to develop responsible generative AI models and address AI\u2019s potential negative consequences. Emilija Stojmenova Duh, Slovenia\u2019s Minister of Digital Transformation, expressed concerns about the biases inherent in AI systems and the need to eliminate them. Darko Matovski, CEO of CausaLens, stated that to build trust in AI innovation, humans need to understand how AI systems operate; AI, in turn, must be able to explain its decisions and actions.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nTo regulate AI, panel members leaned toward a public-private approach between governments and the tech industry. Legislators alone might create regulation that\u2019s inadequate in controlling risks or stifles positive innovation. Tech companies have a better understanding of AI and thus can help governments worldwide ensure that people feel secure in a world with AI, especially those who may be displaced by AI development.\nDigital inclusion for entrepreneurs of all sizes\nSmall and medium enterprises (SMEs) make up the majority of companies worldwide. However, while the digital economy contributes a significant portion to the global gross domestic product, the gaps in digitalization between large businesses and SMEs prevent digital productivity gains from translating into overall economic growth.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nSMEs face challenges in investing in digital upgrades due to high costs, technological barriers and security challenges. A promising solution is the creation of collaborative technology-driven models to help increase SMEs\u2019 digital capabilities in payment, security, marketing and more, at a lower cost. The \u201cPlatform + Independent Software Vendor (ISV)\u201d model, for instance, allows ISVs to use a platform\u2019s repertoire of open APIs to build a customized solution for an SME\u2019s unique need. An example in Hong Kong is restaurant outlet Kitchen 11 Food Court, which uses Alipay\u2019s Smart Restaurant solution to resolve bottlenecks during peak hours. The food court enables customers to use the Alipay app to view menus, order and pay on their phones, removing the in-person frictions of queuing, ordering and paying at every restaurant stall.\nSMEs also struggle with being data-ready and data-driven. Many are unable to unlock valuable insights that can help them gain a competitive advantage due to limited resources, a lack of data policies and difficulty extracting value from data. Multiple Summer Davos sessions called upon stakeholders to help SMEs prioritize data readiness through collaborations between the public and private sectors. Private sector players were urged to share best practices and knowledge on quality management and data governance. Governments and regulators were asked to simplify regulatory frameworks and provide incentives for responsible and ethical data management. International and civil society organizations were encouraged to promote the responsible use of data and provide open-source data tools and training resources.\nThis year\u2019s Summer Davos concluded with experts emphasizing the need for business communities and public sectors to work together to maintain the benefits of a connected and relationship-based world. For Philippine SMEs, embracing AI, data readiness and vital collaborations with the government and private sector can transform their decision-making processes. More importantly, these can help them respond to market trends, streamline operations, capitalize on growth prospects and ignite innovation. INQ\nYour subscription could not be saved.

        "content": "Ambassador Shambhu Kumaran\nArriving during the early part of the pandemic, India\u2019s envoy to the Philippines had one vision: to keep his nose to the grindstone. In the past three years, Ambassador Shambhu Kumaran managed to thrive in pursuing his mission to make the relationship between India and the Philippines more consequential.\nNow on the last year of his posting, Kumaran is busier than ever with talks and agreements on financial technology and science and technology programs. Next year will be a milestone, as the two countries will celebrate 75 years of diplomatic ties, which were established on Nov. 26, 1949.\nEmerging power\nWhy should it matter? \u201cOur ties are very ancient. If you look at the Filipino language, a lot of words that have to do with spirituality and culture have Indian roots. We traded ideas and goods for centuries,\u201d said Kumaran. \u201cAs two key democracies with their share of complex developments, what India and Philippines do together will matter.\u201d\nThe Philippines is dealing with the world\u2019s fifth largest economy. India is projected to rank third place by the end of the decade. As an emerging power, it has joined several alliances such as the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, the world\u2019s largest regional political and economic group; the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, a network committed to support security and order in the Indo Pacific; and the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa) Alliance that bolsters economic cooperation among these fast-growing economies. Moreover, India presides over this year\u2019s G20, a forum of countries with major roles in the global economy, and will host the 2023 G20 New Delhi Summit in September.\n\u201cIndia sees itself as a country with a rightful place in the global order,\u201d said Kumaran.\nIn maintaining peace and order in the maritime territories, Philippine Coast Guard officials were deployed for training in India. Kumaran hopes to further reinforce the maritime cooperation.\nIndia\u2019s economic activity in the Philippines is vibrant. As the world\u2019s largest business process outsourcing country, its companies here employ 200,000 Filipinos.\nPharmaceutics is India\u2019s biggest export. \u201cWe are contributing effectively to the health security of the Filipinos because we are offering high-quality affordable medicines,\u201d said Kumaran.\nThe interest in ancient Indian civilization and culture is reflected in the yoga activities. Likewise, there is a memorandum of agreement wherein experts from the National Institute of Ayurveda will assist the Philippine Institute of Traditional and Alternative Health Care in developing our traditional medicines.\nThe envoy observed that Indian cuisine is becoming popular with the rise of new restaurants not just in NCR, but also in Pampanga and Boracay.\nIn cultural diplomacy, the Philippine Madrigal Singers amazed the world when they rendered their signature choral rendition of Indian folk songs in a YouTube video. Ateneo de Manila co-produced the Tagalog broadcast of \u201cJantaka,\u201d fables and stories on the life of Buddha for children.\nDigital governance\nThe envoy also sees the potential for cooperation in governance. When President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. was newly elected, Kumaran introduced India\u2019s digital governance initiative and how it benefited the poor. Through the Aadhaar, the resident\u2019s identification number, government welfare subsidies (the equivalent of ayuda in the Philippines) were directly transferred to the zero-balance savings accounts of the poor.\n\u201cThis is one of the biggest governance successes. It is of interest to a country like the Philippines where you have similar democratic challenges that need to be addressed in a democratic framework,\u201d said Kumaran.\nAside from the government structure, Kumaran saw other similarities that put him at ease when he came here in 2020.\n\u201cI could sense the generosity of spirit. Filipinos are very engaged. Like India, you are a globalized nation. There are Filipinos in every part of the world as there are Indians. You are naturally curious about what is happening. There is interest in building relations. I found that easy to connect with,\u201d he said.\nTo engage with the locals, he picked up golf. \u201cI found that to be a useful addition to social interactions with a purpose. You meet interesting people who are golfers. They provide a common bond for you to stay in touch,\u201d he said.\n\u2018Sinigang\u2019 at home\nA typical day consists of paper work and meeting with Filipino government officials. \u201cWe try to move our relationship forward all the time,\u201d he said. Aside from socials, the ambassador hosts meals, a form of gastronomic diplomacy, for an assortment of guests\u2014members of the diplomatic corps, Indian businessmen, Filipino academics and even yoga teachers.\nGuests anticipate the Indian cuisine prepared by his wife and a Filipina chef. Kumaran has developed a liking for sinigang, which is occasionally served at home, and the comfort foods sisig and bangus. The buko and mangoes remind him of his home state in Kerala.\nWhen the country reopened, Kumaran explored Luzon and enjoyed Boracay and Palawan. \u201cThe beaches in the Philippines are unparalleled in beauty and in their crystal-clear waters. I take that as the dominant memory of my trips,\u201d he said.\nLike most envoys, Kumaran hopes to see more tourism and business between both countries and visits from top-level officials from India to mark the 75th anniversary of India and Philippine ties.\n\u201cWe established diplomatic relations as young democracies since 1949, and we have since seen the expansion of partnership.\u201d\n\u2014CONTRIBUTED\nRead more",

        "content": "LONDON \u2014 Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine is tragic, infuriating, and unspeakably sad. It is also an unexpected turning point for environmentalism. Until a few days ago, climate change topped the global agenda, with science-based targets pointing the way to a cleaner, more sustainable future. But now, Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s reckless decision to invade a sovereign country and threaten nuclear war has revealed weaknesses in the architecture of international rules and multilateral governance. It is hard to believe that global environmental efforts have any chance of succeeding within such a fragile system.\nStrikingly, this realization has not yet dawned on those engaged in environmental work. A week into the war, the United Nations hailed a major agreement on single-use plastics as a \u201ctriumph\u201d for planet Earth. But such agreements depend on the mutual recognition of sovereign nation-states\u2014precisely the principle that Putin has called into question.\nThe war also imperils efforts to transform the energy system through global cooperation. Sharp increases in oil and gas prices are testing the goodwill of governments and companies. Many OPEC suppliers are seeking to profit from the situation rather than helping to mitigate the shock. Yes, high oil and gas prices and the clear security risk implied by dependence on petrostates like Russia may well accelerate the shift away from fossil fuels. But the economic turmoil on the horizon will discourage investment, and green energy may find itself competing against the military-industrial complex for public finance.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThese developments pose a significant challenge for contemporary environmentalism, a still-young intellectual framework that has seldom had to deal with geopolitical issues. With roots in the pacifist, anti-capitalist movements of the 1960s, the movement became institutionalized at the 1992 UN Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, where the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Convention on Biological Diversity were established. In addition to serving as the backbone of the environmental movement for three decades, these agreements long stood as a monument to the post-Soviet world order.\nFEATURED STORIES\nOPINION\nUrgent action needed vs online piracy as Congress session nears end\nOPINION\nLife has shortened\nOPINION\nThe gift of second chances\nComforted by the notion that all countries could agree, in principle, to be held accountable to environmental objectives, activists and environmental institutions focused their efforts on private and public actors\u2019 predatory and illegal behavior. Taking the rules-based system for granted, they relied on science-based targets to produce global roadmaps to desired outcomes. For a while, this politically neutral approach allowed everyone to avoid the question of whether outcomes delivered by authoritarian states are acceptable. But those days are over: environmental goals can no longer be considered separately from the sources of power that define state authority.\nConsider the issue of biodiversity protection. Most environmental organizations have mobilized behind a \u201c30\u00d730\u201d target\u2014protecting 30 percent of land and ocean areas by 2030. But protecting nature requires more than advocacy. It ultimately depends on the regulatory power of the state, which exercises sovereignty over territory, using force if necessary. Indeed, the Latin origin of \u201cterritory\u201d is not the noun terra, \u201cland,\u201d but the verb terrere, \u201cto terrorize.\u201d Until recently, this distinction would have seemed pedantic. Not anymore. Conservation depends on state power, so it matters very much which state we are talking about.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThe problem is hardly limited to Putin\u2019s delusions of empire. When Chinese President Xi Jinping, on his first visit to Davos in 2017, portrayed his government as a global environmental steward, he was met with applause. China\u2019s \u201cecological civilization\u201d was hailed as an example of global environmentalist leadership, rather than as an application of ecological Marxism, a project that is indifferent to individuals\u2019 civil and political rights. But now, we should recognize the danger of elevating despots to the status of environmental heroes. Without the rule of law and the protection of human dignity, environmental commitments may not be worth the paper they are printed on.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nTraditional Western environmentalism grew up protesting an order that it now must defend. The question is whether it is prepared, or even equipped, for the task. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz apparently saw no need to consult his Green Party coalition partners before he greenlit sending weapons to Ukraine and vastly increasing Germany\u2019s military spending\u2014two paradigm-shifting policy changes.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nMoreover, as governments around the world sanction Russian oligarchs who owe their fortunes to Putin, we should not forget that many environmental initiatives have also benefited from wealth created under authoritarian regimes. Prince William\u2019s \u201cEarthshot Prize,\u201d for example, has received grants from Emirati corporate giants and Chinese tycoons.\nModern environmentalism may now need to re-examine its methods. With the war in Eastern Europe dragging on, it is already clear that the movement can no longer afford to ignore the nature of political power. The defense of self-determination and political agency now must become a fundamental principle of environmental action.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\n\u2014Project Syndicate\n* * *\nGiulio Boccaletti, an honorary research associate at the University of Oxford\u2019s Smith School of Enterprise and the Environment, is a former chief strategy officer of The Nature Conservancy and the author of \u201cWater: A Biography\u201d (Pantheon, 2021).\nYour subscription could not be saved.

        "content": "The increasing frequency and severity of natural disasters, coupled with civilization\u2019s inability to live sustainably, has become a serious problem for most countries. The Philippines is no exception. Climate change has put the most vulnerable sectors of the country in harm\u2019s way.\nFilipinos are no stranger to the real effect of exogenous shocks to the economy brought about by climate change and environment-induced risks. Left unaddressed, these predicaments will continue to not only lead to major economic losses but also endanger the present and future generations. Ground realities become more vivid as the Department of Finance in November 2021 reported that about 98.2 percent or P506.1 billion of the total economic losses were due to climate-related hazards. Additionally, according to the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council, the total damages to agriculture and infrastructure incurred due to Supertyphoon \u201cOdette\u2019\u201d alone amounted to P29 billion as of Jan. 13, 2022. Despite countless first-hand experiences, majority of Filipinos still remain unaware of the consequences of inadequate preparations and inaction. This is shown by a Stratbase ADR Institute-commissioned survey conducted by Social Weather Stations in October 2021. The survey, which sought to find out what hinders the Philippines from addressing climate change, revealed that 34 percent of respondents do not know, cannot understand, have no answer, or are not aware of the issues concerning climate change. What is even more frustrating is that 40 percent responded with an invalid answer. However, environmental challenges can give way to reforms through concrete and aggressive sustainability commitments.\nThankfully, on their own, the country\u2019s big businesses have been actively taking steps in not only keeping the economy running strong, but also in making sustainable investments, anchored on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) principles. Collectively, these fundamentals will contribute to a strong green economic rebound in the post-COVID-19 era. It is worthy to note that in the said SWS survey, 81 percent of Filipinos agree that the government should engage the private sector to invest in public infrastructures such as roads, bridges, and airports to save government funds for COVID-19. Encouraging public-private partnerships to build more sustainable infrastructure is key to ushering sustained and inclusive economic growth.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThrough the private sector\u2019s integration of ESG in their core businesses, they will be better equipped to identify the needs of the people they serve and the communities they operate in while ensuring continued value creation in their services and products. Their investments and initiatives in the communities will help position themselves, in partnership with host communities, to respond to immediate and long-term threats and challenges.\nFEATURED STORIES\nOPINION\nUrgent action needed vs online piracy as Congress session nears end\nOPINION\nLife has shortened\nOPINION\nThe gift of second chances\nMeanwhile, when shaping policies, the government needs to consider a range of factors in order to design frameworks that are inclusive of the most vulnerable sectors, while being conducive and attractive to ESG-based business investments and initiatives. This combination will provide more public access to power and communication services that are calamity-resilient and encourage huge investments to upgrade our roads, bridges, and other transportation and digital infrastructure. These policies must be anchored on promoting sustainability and environmental stewardship to meet the growing demands of the current generation without jeopardizing the needs of future generations.\nDespite the continuing COVID-induced economic drawbacks such as unemployment and hunger, the issue of climate risks should not be put on the back burner. In light of the upcoming national and local elections in May 2022, the country\u2019s next leaders should commit to greater multi-sectoral collaboration to strengthen environmental stewardship. Indeed, tackling environmental risks and pushing for a more sustainable and resilient future is a responsibility shared by all of society, exemplifying the true bayanihan spirit that Filipinos are known for.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\n* * *\nDindo Manhit is founder and managing director of Stratbase Group.\nYour subscription could not be saved.

Only a few more swings of the pendulum, and, from Moscow to Chicago, atomic explosions will strike midnight for Western Civilization.\u201d\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nREAD:\n100 Seconds to Doomsday\nIn 1991, the clock was set 17 minutes to midnight\u2014the farthest from the looming apocalypse compared to any time period since 1947.\nGraphic: Ed Lustan\nDuring this year, the Cold War has officially ended and then-US President George H.W. Bush and then-Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev signed the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START), which greatly reduced the number of strategic nuclear weapons deployable by the two countries.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nNearing doom\u2019s door\nWhile experts from the Bulletin acknowledged the positive impact of the leadership change in the United States last year, they said it was \u201cnot enough\u201d to \u201creverse negative international security trends\u201d which occurred and threaten nations across the globe in 2021.\nAccording to the Bulletin, the changes in US policies made under US President Joe Biden\u2019s administration have, in some ways, made the world safer.\nREAD:\nJoe Biden elected 46th US president\nIt also noted that the changes in the US administration have brought hope that \u201cwhat seemed like a global race toward catastrophe might be halted\u201d and even reversed.\nSome of these policies, according to the Bulletin, were:\nthe US and Russia\u2019s agreement to extend the 2010 New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START)\u2014the only remaining US-Russia arms control pact\u2014for five years;\nthe Biden administration\u2019s plan to return to the 2015 Iran nuclear deal\nthe United States\u2019 return to the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement.\nREAD:\nUS rejoins fight against climate change at high level summit\n\u201cPerhaps even more heartening was the return of science and evidence to US policymaking in general, especially regarding the COVID-19 pandemic,\u201d said the SASB.\nGraphic: Ed Lustan\n\u201cA more moderate and predictable approach to leadership and the control of one of the two largest nuclear arsenals of the world marked a welcome change from the previous four years,\u201d it added.\nHowever, with threats\u2014continuing tense relations between the US on one side and Russia and China on the other, climate change, future biological threats, and the dangers of technology in the age of disinformation\u2014the world remained far from safe from destruction.\n\u201cThe members of the Science and Security Board find the world to be no safer than it was last year at this time and therefore decide to set the Doomsday Clock once again at 100 seconds to midnight,\u201d the SASB said.\n\u201cThis decision does not, by any means, suggest that the international security situation has stabilized. On the contrary, the Clock remains the closest it has ever been to the civilization-ending apocalypse because the world remains stuck in an extremely dangerous moment,\u201d it added.\n\u201cIn 2019 we called it the new abnormal, and it has unfortunately persisted.\u201d\n\u2018Tick, tick, boom!\u2019\nDespite positive developments in nuclear policies, which mainly involved the US, there were still events last year that have pushed a rise in nuclear risks.\nOne of the biggest threats flagged by experts from the Bulletin was the tense relations between the US, Russia, and China, all of which are engaged in \u201can array of nuclear modernization and expansion efforts.\u201d\nLast year, a report published by the Washington Post detailed that China had begun constructing over 100 new missile silos\u2014an apparent large-scale program to increase the country\u2019s capacity to deploy silo-based long-range nuclear missiles.\nGraphic: Ed Lustan\nThe report, which cited commercial satellite images and analysis from the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies in Monterey, California, said that there were 119 nearly identical construction sites that had similar features to the existing launch facilities for China\u2019s current arsenal of nuclear-tipped ballistic missiles.\nREAD:\nU.S. calls build-up of China\u2019s nuclear arsenal \u2018concerning\u2019\nIn its annual report to Congress, the US Department of Defense said that \u201cover the next decade, the PRC aims to modernize, diversify and expand its nuclear forces.\u201d\n\u201cThe PRC (People\u2019s Republic of China) is investing in, and expanding, the number of its land, sea, and air-based nuclear delivery platforms and constructing the infrastructure necessary to support this major expansion of its nuclear forces,\u201d the report stated.\nThe experts from the Bulletin likewise mentioned the three nation\u2019s push to develop hypersonic missiles, as well as the anti-satellite tests conducted by several other countries.\nThese threats and trends, according to the Bulletin, could potentially mark the start of a new arms competition if not restrained.\nThe outcome of these possible nuclear conflicts, as described by an article published by Vox, would be \u201cas predictable as it is unthinkable.\u201d\nThe report detailed that for a city with around four million people, the combined heat and pressure wave from a single 800-kiloton warhead\u2014\u201cwhich is the yield of most of the warheads in Russia\u2019s ICBM arsenal\u201d\u2014could instantly kill 120,000 people.\nMore people would die during firestorms and radiation fallout following the initial impact of the nuclear attack.\nAlso included in the nuclear tightrope, which has helped place the world seconds away from doom, was the nuclear tests and unconstrained nuclear and missile expansion by North Korea.\nLast Jan. 31, North Korea confirmed that it had launched a Hwasong-12 ballistic missile, its biggest nuclear-capable missile since 2017.\nREAD:\nNorth Korea tests biggest missile since 2017, U S calls for talks\nMoving away from doomsday\nAccording to Mecklin, the Bulletin\u2019s decision to keep the Doomsday Clock at 100 seconds to midnight sends a clear message to the world: \u201cWe need to back away from the doorstep of doom.\u201d\nIn order to do so, the Bulletin recommended some practical steps to protect humanity from the major global threats, including:\nA more ambitious and comprehensive limit on nuclear weapons and delivery systems by the US and Russia by the end of 2022.\n\u201cThey should both agree to reduce reliance on nuclear weapons by limiting their roles, missions, and platforms, and decrease budgets accordingly,\u201d said Mecklin.\nAccelerating the US and other country\u2019s decarbonization matching policies to commitments.\nInstead of fossil fuel-intensive projects, the Bulletin suggested China set an example in the Belt and Road Initiative by pursuing sustainable development pathways.\n\u201cUS and other leaders should work through the World Health Organization and other international institutions to reduce biological risks of all kinds through better monitoring of animal-human interactions, improvements in international disease surveillance and reporting, increased production and distribution of medical supplies, and expanded hospital capacity.\u201d\nWealthy countries should provide additional financial support and technology cooperation to developing countries to undertake strong climate action.\nDevising more effective regimes for monitoring biological research and development efforts.\nGovernments, technology firms, academic experts, and media organizations should cooperate to identify and implement practical and ethical ways to combat internet-enabled misinformation and disinformation.\n\u201cWithout swift and focused action, truly catastrophic events\u2014events that could end civilization as we know it\u2014are more likely.

        "content": "July 2021 marks the 100th founding anniversary of the Communist Party of China (CPC). Once the most impoverished in the world, China, governed by the 95-million-strong Communist Party, is the largest populated nation at 1.4 billion people, and is now an enviable global economic power. It has the world\u2019s largest middle class population, comprising two-thirds of the country.\nChina is an Asian neighbor that has traded with our islands since precolonial times. What can we Filipinos learn from this awakened dragon that has had 5,000 years of statecraft and civilization, having invented many technologies such as paper-making, the compass, gunpowder, printing, silk, among others? Ancient and modern China have weathered civil wars, famines, and defeat in wars against foreign powers that forced the sale of opium to the country, leading to the annexation of some of its parts. Rising from a century of colonial humiliations, the CPC has led China\u2019s liberation from feudal poverty to its colossal industrial growth today.\nProbably the first great lesson we can learn from China is its poverty eradication program, which, according to the IMF-WB and the UNDP, is \u201cthe most successful anti- poverty program in the world.\u201d It has uplifted more than 800 million people to middle-class status in just a matter of four decades.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThe second great lesson we can learn from this neighbor is how, in a matter of four decades, it achieved economic revolution with its remarkable industrialization program, transforming a backward agricultural economy into a high-tech one that has overtaken most Western countries. Its \u201cFour Modernizations\u201d program in agriculture, industry, science and technology, and defense is a model that many less developed countries can emulate.\nFEATURED STORIES\nOPINION\nUrgent action needed vs online piracy as Congress session nears end\nOPINION\nLife has shortened\nOPINION\nThe gift of second chances\nThe third lesson we can learn from China is how it evolved its own strategies to keep abreast with the times, and creatively adjusted to the changing national and international situation to build a strong nation firmly guided by \u201csocialism with Chinese characteristics.\u201d In 2018, during the bicentennial year of the birth of Karl Marx, China hosted the 2nd World Congress on Marxism in Beijing, where its keynote speaker, President Xi Jinping, head of the largest communist party in the world, hailed Karl Marx as \u201cthe greatest thinker of modern times\u201d and called on all socialists in the world \u201cto continuously improve the ability to use Marxism to analyze and solve practical problems in a creative way.\u201d\nIn its foreign policy, China is the strongest and most consistent supporter of Cuba, Venezuela, North Korea, Syria, and the Palestinian cause. It has established an alternative Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank to remove the monopoly of capitalist countries in using development aid to control and steer development planning in other countries toward the neoliberal paradigm. Its Belt and Road Initiative and New Silk Road have been its soft power response to the militarized orientation of the US-led NATO version of the Quad (the US, Japan, Australia, and India) in Asia. It has consistently practiced a \u201cpeaceful rise\u201d philosophy in engaging the capitalist West, learning from and using the very tools of capitalism to create surplus value in a centrally-planned economy.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThe US\u2019 Cold War containment strategy of encircling China with 50 overseas military bases has been revived. This has led to China\u2019s paranoia and increasingly militarized strategy in the South China Sea (SCS) to protect its southern and eastern coastlines and cities. China today has its own version of America\u2019s Monroe Doctrine for the SCS, militarizing what used to be part of the \u201cAmerican lake\u201d with its unilateral \u201cnine-dash line\u201d that claims almost 90 percent of the SCS. This has alarmingly impeded freedom of navigation in international waters and impinged on the traditional fishing grounds and the exclusive economic zones of the Philippines, Vietnam, and Indonesia.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nChina faces the challenge of practicing rules-based diplomacy under terms it itself has committed to, and avoiding the mistakes of previous big powers that overextended themselves through an unproductive arms race and foreign military intervention. As the CPC celebrates its centennial year, the world can only learn from China\u2019s achievements and mistakes in transforming an impoverished nation into what has become the leading global economic power.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\n* * *&nbsp;\nRoland G.

The first bottle of wine was brewed in the desert region in 1984.\nA Chinese TV drama series, depicting how grape plantation and cattle breeding were among poverty alleviation measures in Minning township, has garnered millions of views on YouTube. The Chinese drama \u201cShanhaiqing\u201d goes by the English title \u201cMinning Town.\u201d\nWhile in a few decades, the edge of the Gobi Desert has been transformed with extending vineyards irrigated by water sourced from the Yellow River.\nCurrently, the coverage of vineyards in Ningxia accounts for one fourth of China\u2019s total, yielding 36 high-quality grape varieties. There are 211 wine chateaux \u2014 completed or under construction \u2014 with an annual output of 130 million bottles of wine, accounting for 60 percent of China-produced wines.\nChilean Ambassador to China Luis Schmidt Montes extended his congratulations on the launch of the wine pilot zone. He said that the path outlined through this initiative for the grape and wine industry in Ningxia would allow the development of this industry to compete with the most prominent wine-producing regions in the world side by side.\nPioneering role\nBy designating the wine area as a national pilot zone, China hopes to optimize the whole-chain development of the wine-manufacturing industry and introduce measures and standards of the International Organization of Vine and Wine countries to help regulate the sector.\nSui, the official with the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, said the establishment of the pilot zone can encourage government departments and market entities to \u201cboldly try\u201d all measures and models that can help industrial development.\nThe beautiful architecture of chateaux and wine tasting areas have turned wineries into popular tourist spots.\n\u201cLast year, our winery received more than a dozen visitors on average every day, including free travelers, wine lovers and distributors,\u201d said Zhang Xueyan, owner of Ningxia Huangkou Winery.\nIn 2020, the sales of the winery hit 13.95 million yuan. This year, before the arrival of the peak season, the sales of its red wines have chalked up more than 8 million yuan.\nZhang said she believes that with the pilot zone\u2019s preferential policies, the wine zone will become more and more internationally competitive.\nChristelle Chene from Burgundy, a famous wine region in France, came to Xige Estate, a winery in Ningxia, in 2019 to work on promoting the local winery products in the global market.\n\u201cIn Ningxia, I have got my favorite wine taste with a rich fruity aroma and delicate tannin. I want to promote the wines here to the whole world,\u201d she said.\nThe wine and grape industry has become an important pillar of Ningxia\u2019s sustainable economic development, offering more than 120,000 jobs.

        "content": "During President Duterte\u2019s last televised address, Education Secretary Leonor Briones announced that the World Bank gave in to her demand for a public apology, following its premature release of an unfavorable report on the current state of Philippine education. That is the spin. In reality, the apology does not change the substance and recommendations of the report. Secretary Briones authorized Philippine participation in the 2018 Programme for International Student Assessment, and when the negative report was made public in 2019, the Department of Education (DepEd) was ready with a spin. Nobody doubts that DepEd is doing its job, the question is how can we do better?\nReading the 1925 Monroe Commission report on Philippine education I was struck by the opening lines: \u201cThe Board of Educational Survey is not unmindful of the consequences which may result from its frank discussion of Philippine education. There is in the report much criticism of existing conditions. This report will fall into the hands not only of persons who have at heart the welfare of the Filipino people, but also into the hands of some who may seek to reap some personal advantage from such criticism. Such an exposition may be expected to stimulate those responsible for the success of administration to the correction of defects. But it may also be used as a basis of attacks on members of the present administration by persons actuated by unworthy motives.\u201d\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThen as now, government officials are sensitive to truth that can be weaponized for personal, partisan, or political purposes.\nFEATURED STORIES\nOPINION\nUrgent action needed vs online piracy as Congress session nears end\nOPINION\nLife has shortened\nOPINION\nThe gift of second chances\nSignificant findings of the Monroe report are on the medium of instruction, the need for a common language, and bridging communication in an archipelago separated by many Philippine languages and dialects. English was introduced to replace Spanish and bring to a Malay people \u201cAnglo-Saxon institutions and civilization\u2026[as well as] ideals of universality, practicality, and democracy.\u201d Universal education was recommended but one suited to the needs of Filipinos. Issues on quantity and quality of education, academic vs. social education, were noted. Not all students were suited for an academic path so there was a need for more agricultural, trade, and vocational schools.\nThen as now Reading was not the problem but Literacy or understanding what is read. The 1921 Civil Service Records revealed that 98 percent failed the English composition exam. Nobody passed the 1918 exams for messengers and third-class patrolmen. In the 1922 exams for junior teachers, 87 percent of them failed. How would today\u2019s students perform in international assessments if the tests were conducted in Filipino? How successful are our bilingual or mother tongue experiments?\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nIn 1925, the Board found that classroom education was bookish and artificial (Filipinos were then using US textbooks alien to their lives). There was \u201can overemphasis on uniformity and a corresponding failure to provide for initiative and participation.\u201d Different subjects were taught \u201cin almost complete isolation, one from the other.\u201d Worse, \u201cthe development of the ability to think, to meet new situations, and to solve the kinds of problems one meets in real life is neglected. The educational process here is largely the memorizing of materials in books or the developing of specific skills in formal operations or hand work.\u201d This sounds painfully familiar.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nAttention-grabbing recommendations from the 677-page report: That real property, real estate and cedula taxes be increased and devoted to educational purposes; that national government should not bear all expenses of education, that provinces and local government should share in it. \u201cSupport of the academic high school be thrown entirely upon the province, with the option that cost of instruction be born by tuition or provincial funds or a combination of the two,\u201d it said.

        "content": "Paris\u2014In September 2000, 189 countries signed the \u201cMillennium Declaration,\u201d shaping the principles of international cooperation for a new era of progress toward common goals. Emerging from the Cold War, we were confident about our capacity to build a multilateral order capable of tackling the big challenges of the time: hunger and extreme poverty, environmental degradation, diseases, economic shocks, and the prevention of conflicts. In September 2015, all countries again committed to an ambitious agenda to tackle global challenges together: the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\nOur world has experienced diverging trends, leading to increased prosperity globally, while inequalities remain or increase. Democracies have expanded at the same time that nationalism and protectionism have seen a resurgence. Over the past decades, two major crises have disrupted our societies and weakened our common policy frameworks, casting doubt on our capacity to overcome shocks, address their root causes, and secure a better future for generations to come. They have also reminded us of how interdependent we are.\nThe most serious crises call for the most ambitious decisions to shape the future. We believe that this one can be an opportunity to rebuild consensus for an international order based on multilateralism and the rule of law through efficient cooperation, solidarity, and coordination. In this spirit, we are determined to work together, with and within the United Nations, regional organizations, international fora such as the G7 and G20, and ad hoc coalitions to tackle the global challenges we face now and in the future.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nHealth is the first emergency. The COVID-19 crisis is the greatest test of global solidarity in generations. It has reminded us of an obvious fact: In the face of a pandemic, our health safety chain is only as strong as the weakest health system. COVID-19 anywhere is a threat to people and economies everywhere.\nFEATURED STORIES\nOPINION\nUrgent action needed vs online piracy as Congress session nears end\nOPINION\nLife has shortened\nOPINION\nThe gift of second chances\nThe pandemic calls for a strong coordinated international response that rapidly expands access to tests, treatments, and vaccines, recognizing extensive immunization as a global public good that must be available and affordable for all. In this regard, we fully support the unique global platform Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator, launched by the World Health Organization and G20 partners in April.\nThe emergency is also environmental. Ahead of the UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow in November, we must enhance our efforts to tackle climate change and make our economies more sustainable. By early 2021, countries accounting for more than 65 percent of global greenhouse-gas emissions are likely to have made ambitious commitments to carbon neutrality. All national governments, businesses, cities, and financial institutions should now join the global coalition for reducing CO2 emissions to net zero according to the Paris climate agreement\u2014and start implementing concrete plans and policies.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nNo doubt, globalization and international cooperation have helped billions of people escape poverty; but nearly half the world\u2019s population still struggles to meet basic needs. And within many countries, the gap between rich and poor has become unsustainable, women still do not enjoy equal opportunity, and many people need to be reassured about the benefits of globalization.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nAs we help our economies overcome the worst recession since 1945, it remains our core priority to ensure rules-based free trade as an important engine of inclusive, sustainable growth. We must, therefore, strengthen the World Trade Organization and fully use the potential of international trade for our economic recovery. At the same time, protection of the environment and health as well as social standards must be placed at the heart of our economic models while ensuring the necessary conditions for innovation.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThe rise of new technologies has been a great asset for progress and inclusion, contributing to the openness and resilience of societies, economies, and states, while proving lifesaving during the pandemic. Yet, almost half the world\u2019s population\u2014and more than half the world\u2019s women and girls\u2014remain offline and unable to access their benefits.\nMoreover, the considerable power of new technologies can be misused to limit the rights and freedoms of citizens, to spread hatred, or to commit serious crimes. We need to build on existing initiatives and involve the relevant stakeholders toward effectively regulating the internet in order to create a safe, free, and open digital environment, where the flow of data in a trusted environment is guaranteed. Benefits must accrue especially to the most disadvantaged including by addressing the tax challenges of the digitalization of the economy and combating harmful tax competition.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nFinally, the health crisis interrupted the education of millions of children and students. We must keep the promise to provide education for all and to equip the next generation with understanding for basic skills and science, as well as an understanding of different cultures, tolerance and acceptance of pluralism, and respect for freedom of conscience. Children and youth are our future, and their education is key.\nTo meet these challenges, multilateralism is not just another diplomatic technique. It shapes a world order and is a very specific way of organizing international relations based on cooperation, the rule of law, collective action, and shared principles. Rather than pitting civilizations and values against one another, we must build a more inclusive multilateralism, respecting our differences as much as our common values enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\nThe world after COVID-19 will not be the same again. Let us make use of different fora and opportunities such as the Paris Peace Forum to work toward tackling these challenges with a clear vision. We invite political, economic, religious, and thought leaders to contribute to this global conversation. Project Syndicate\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nYour subscription could not be saved.

Chinese Ambassador to India Sun Weidong recently noted that \u201cboth China and India are victims of imperialism and colonialism.\u201d China, Sun asserted, should not be labeled as \u201cexpansionist.\u201d Asianist Sheldon Pollock writes: \u201cThe theory of civilization needs historical scarcity; nationalism, by contrast, requires historical surplus. No civilization wants its origins searched, and every nation does.\u201d Since China has been expounding a \u201ccivilizational theory\u201d of the state, it disdains scrutiny, especially by the non-Chinese.\nChina pigeonholes its ancient civilization into a modern state. Contrarily, India sees itself as a postcolonial state replacing the British government. Too, while Beijing fights with India on the Himalayas, it fights with another country in the South China Sea that is building the state from the belly of colonialism\u2014the Philippines. Does the dragon worry the elephant, which looks to make its first overseas sale of Indo-Russo BrahMos missiles to the carabao in Manila?\nChina\u2019s imperial fixation has two prongs: land and oceanic boundaries. \u201cWhether it is the South China Sea issue or China-India boundary question,\u201d Sun said, \u201cwe have been committed to settling disputes through dialogue.\u201d But the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (VCLT) 1969 makes unilateral changes to boundary-establishing treaties illegal. It safeguards the UN Charter\u2019s Article 2.4 on the prohibition of the \u201cthreat or use of force against territorial integrity\u201d of states. The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, the Unclos 1982, is however different. Beijing sat in the Unclos negotiations for nine years. Yet China argues for ousting Unclos in favor of \u201crespect for historical facts.\u201d\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nSun argued that \u201cthe boundary question is a leftover from history, which is very complicated and sensitive,\u201d needing a \u201cmutually acceptable solution through equal consultation and peaceful negotiation.\u201d However, \u201chistorical facts\u201d betray smoking guns when the Chinese cite poetry. Judge Zhiguo Gao and Professor Bing Bing Jia, for example, said, \u201cthe term Nan Hai (Southern Sea) appeared in Shi Jing (The Classic of Poetry), a publication of 475\u2013221 BC, and it has remained the standard appellation in Chinese for the South China Sea ever since.\u201d Chinese scholars sheepishly acknowledge arranging private air trips to the South China Sea for Asian international lawyers.\nFEATURED STORIES\nOPINION\nUrgent action needed vs online piracy as Congress session nears end\nOPINION\nLife has shortened\nOPINION\nThe gift of second chances\nDrafting the 1935 Constitution under American tutelage, the Filipino constitutionalists made sure to write into it the rectangular metes and bounds of the 1898 Treaty of Paris as integral to national territory. To the American commitment to grant independence to Filipinos, delegate Vicente Singson Encarnacion wanted to tie the integrity of the Philippine archipelago since the world only understood international law fastened to smoking imperial cannons.\nThe document by which Spain ceded the Philippines to the United States for $20 million was invoked by the colony in an anti-imperialist move. Filipinos carried this over to the post-independence 1973 and 1987 Constitutions, as well as to treaty negotiations for the Unclos.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nNew international realities would force Filipinos to reimagine history in the 21st century.

In response, the Philippine Supreme Court, in Magallona v. Executive Secretary (2011), upheld the constitutionality of the new Baselines law according to Unclos rules. In 2014, the Philippines filed the landmark arbitral case against China.

        "content": "Wood has been one of the most common construction building materials ever since the dawn of civilization. Throughout history, buildings have been made of wood. Japan and China, having a long tradition of timber construction, have enormous wood structures that continue to stand today. Scandinavia, a country with heavy forests, has had much experience with timber construction. There are also notable examples from France, Holland, Germany and Switzerland with varying architectural styles.\nWood, however, has several disadvantages such as water damage, fire, decay and termites. The early 20th century hence saw a shift towards bricks, concrete, and steel, which allowed architects to design new and innovative buildings.\nSo, why are some architects recommending a return to wood construction after a century of concrete and steel?\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nConcrete and steel are costly to produce, consume a lot of energy and are heavy to transport. Wood, however, can be grown sustainably and is lighter than concrete. As trees grow, they absorb carbon dioxide from the air, locking it into the timber. Regular timber cannot compete with the strength of concrete and steel and is not strong enough to build high-rise buildings, but engineers have found a solution. It is called cross laminated timber (CLT) or glue-laminated timber (glulam).\nFEATURED STORIES\nBUSINESS\nMore foreign brands seen coming to PH shores in 2025\nBUSINESS\nGlobal Dominion: Simplifying financing to empower every Filipino\nBUSINESS\nInternational group kicks off infrastructure investment drive for PH\nCross laminated timber or glue laminated timber is made up of wooden planks that are sawn, glued, and layered.\u2014ASCE LIBRARY\nWhat is cross laminated timber?\nCLT is made up of wooden planks that are sawn, glued and layered, wherein each layer is oriented perpendicular to the previous plank. By joining layers of wood at perpendicular angles, it gains structural strength for the panel. This results in an extraordinarily strong and stable material. CLT is a sustainable material because its basic material is wood, a renewable resource. It also does not require the burning of fossil fuels during its production. CLT is light and it is comparable in strength to concrete and steel.\nWhat happens when CLT is burnt?\nIt loses some of its structural mass, but when you remove the heat source, it extinguishes itself. When steel is exposed to extreme heat or flames, it gets a bit softer. This is what happens when some steel roofs collapse in fires, whereas wooden roofs have not.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nUses of CLT\nThe panels can be used as floors, walls and ceilings with the dimensions following the requirements of the project. They can also be used for infrastructure and large construction sites, as forms for concreting bridges. Today, CLT components are being used even in skyscrapers.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThere are several advantages in using CLT: shorter construction time, greater quality control and more efficient cleaning. It is exceptionally light particularly compared to concrete and steel, so it is possible to build taller buildings on the same sized foundations.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nMj\u00f8st\u00e5rnet by Voll Arkitekter in Brumunddal, Norway is the world\u2019s tallest timber building. \u2014DEZEEN.COM\nNew generation of timber buildings\nIn Brumunddal, Norway, Mjostarnet by Voll Arkitekter is the tallest timber building in the world, according to the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat. Standing at 280 feet (18 stories), the new building is called \u201cplayscraper\u201d in Norway. The builders used glulam and laminated timber beams, which are strong enough to replace carbon-intensive concrete and steel. To overcome strong external forces, large-scale columns and trusses were utilized. The building was tested for fire safety and was designed to withstand a complete burnout.\nOakwood Timber Tower in London is the city\u2019s first timber skyscraper with conceptual plans for an 80-story, 300-meter-high wooden building integrated with another building.

It has a height of 15 meters and a span of 30 meters. The large arches are joined by thousands of smaller ribs to form a skeletal structure. The timber beams were prefabricated in Austria and assembled in Cebu in only three months.\nFor Clark International Airport, the wood used in the glulamtimber roof arches is made from white spruce imported from Austria sourced from sustainable commercial forests.\u2014CLARK INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT\nClark International Airport New Terminal (2020)\nThe new, modern passenger terminal, located in a special economic zone, is expected to be the next premier gateway of Asia, connecting travelers throughout the region. The wood used in the glulam timber roof arches is made from white spruce imported from Austria sourced from sustainable commercial forests.\nFuture of CLT in PH\nWith the completion of the Mactan Cebu International Airport and the Clark International Airport, a new era in timber construction has just begun. The question is: will this be the start of the construction of timber buildings in the Philippines?\nBefore the technology can be adopted in the country, there are two issues that must be addressed. First is the issue of sustainable forests.\nSustainable forests refer to an effective and efficient management system to replace trees that are cut so that forests continue to exist. Without a sustainable forest management system, the idea of promoting timber construction would be disastrous as trees are depleted without replenishment to supply the new building technology.\nThe other issue is the embodied energy of materials. To reduce carbon emissions, it is preferred that locally sourced (or regionally sourced) materials are used rather than those from distant locations. Embodied energy refers to the energy consumed as a product goes through the process of mining and processing of natural resources to manufacturing, transport and product delivery.\nYour subscription could not be saved.

They had earlier sailed from Palawan to Cebu in time for the launching of a 500-day countdown to the 500th anniversary of the Battle of Mactan next year.\nThe 18-meter and 21-meter boats are replicas of the \u201cbalangay,\u201d a vessel used by mariners of an ancient civilization that developed along the mighty Agusan River during the third century. These balangay are navigated through the way of ancient mariners by relying on the position of the sun and stars, wind direction, cloud formations, wave patterns and bird flights.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nTapping the traditional navigational methods would, in a way, \u201cresurrect the seafaring spirit of our forefathers,\u201d leading people to appreciate \u201cwhat [they were] are capable of doing, \u2026 as adventurous seafarers and discoverers,\u201d said Arturo Valdez, who led the crew.\nFEATURED STORIES\nNEWSINFO\nBar exam 2024: List of successful examinees\nNEWSINFO\n3 schools have highest percentage of passers among first-time bar exam takers\nNEWSINFO\nHouse panel: Ex-president Duterte center of grand criminal enterprise\nThe boats do not have modern navigational aids and are only equipped with small engines for use in case of emergency.\u201cNow I am back here in Butuan City, the home of the balangay, hopefully to stir the conscience and revive the pride, and remind everyone here that the balangay is a Butuan boat, and that Butuan is the balangay,\u201d Valdez said.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nIn 2006, Valdez organized the conquest by Filipino climbers of Mt.

Pottery shards were also recovered from a balangay in 2012.\nThe oldest balangay unearthed in Barangay Libertad in Butuan dates back to 320 AD. Other finds were dated around 900 AD and 1250 AD.\nTreasure hunters discovered the ancient boats in 1976. Experts from the National Museum counted nine vessels, but in 2012, more diggings in the area yielded the tenth.\nThe boats have been declared national cultural treasures under Proclamation No. 86, issued by then President Corazon Aquino in March 1987.So far, remnants of three boats had been dug. A more complete boat is on display at the Maritime Hall of the National Museum in Manila while another is at a National Museum site in Libertad.\nReplica\nExcavations stopped in 2014 as funding ran short and access problems cropped up as the site sits on private property.\nEfforts to revive the balangay legacy came when the three replicas were built starting 2009. The boats set off on a voyage, with Valdez leading the crew that used the traditional navigation methods.\nValdez tapped the centuries-old boat-building knowledge of the Sama people of Tawi-Tawi to build the balangay replicas. He sought permission from the Department of Environment and Natural Resources to harvest local hardwood species, like red \u201clawaan,\u201d apitong and \u201cyakal,\u201d to build the boats.\nUNEARTHING HISTORY A technician of the National Museum cleans parts of a wooden plank of a \u201cbalangay\u201d during an archaeological excavation in Butuan City eight years ago.\nWork on one boat, named \u201cDiwata ng Lahi,\u201d was done at the Cultural Center of the Philippines complex next to Manila Bay while two \u2014 \u201cMasawa Hong Butuan\u201d and \u201cSama Tawi-Tawi\u201d \u2014 were done in Butuan.\nDiwata ng Lahi\u2019s first voyage was on Sept. 1, 2009, sailing from Manila to Butuan and passing by 54 ports. On Feb. 4, 2010, Masawa Hong Butuan joined Diwata ng Lahi in a voyage to Zamboanga City and on to Sulu where the third boat, Sama Tawi-Tawi, caught up with them from Butuan.\nBy September that year, all three boats journeyed to Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Cambodia, Thailand and Singapore, and back to the Philippines.\nAfter the voyage, the Diwata ng Lahi was loaned to the National Museum as a cultural exhibit. So was the Masawa Hong Butuan in Butuan.\nTwo more balangay were built in 2016 for a journey to commemorate the 600th year since the 1417 voyage of Sulu Sultan Paduka Pahala, popularly known as Sultan Paduka Batara, from Maimbung, Sulu, to Dezhou, a city in China\u2019s Shandong province.\nFor the 500th anniversary of the Battle of Mactan next year, the two replicas were named Raya Siyagu and Raya Kolambu in honor of the kings of Mazaua and Butuan, respectively.\nMore support\nThe building of the replicas has always been a private initiative. The first three boats were the fruits of collaboration among the TAO Community of Companies, Butuan Global Forum (BGF) and Kaya ng Pinoy Inc. Sulu Gov. Sakur Tan donated the wood materials, while private donors gave cash.\nToday, the Sama Tawi-Tawi is docked in Palawan province, needing repairs.\nValdez and Jody Navarra of BGF cited the need for more support for the maintenance of the balangay as a way of continually reminding Filipinos of their rich history.\nYour subscription could not be saved.

Lawrence Fortun, who is pushing for the declaration of balangay as the country\u2019s national boat, said the government should take a big part in funding the initiatives. He also hoped to have the private estate in Libertad declared a national historical site so that full development could be undertaken, and to hasten the settlement of ownership over the land.\nButuan Mayor Ronnie Vicente Lagnada promised to keep the balangay legacy alive by building more replicas. Tours along the Agusan River using the balangay are already being planned, he said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been more than a decade \u2026 I think it is time to pass on the torch and I think there is no other better place to pass this on than to the people of Butuan, to the home of the balangay,\u201d Valdez said.\nREAD NEXT\nGrave marker revives interest in WWII heroine Maria Orosa\nThis Week\u2019s Festivals: Feb. 16-22, 2020\nEDITORS' PICK\nGlow all out: Sparkly makeup to welcome the New Year\nHouse panel: Duterte center of grand criminal enterprise\nCourt clears model in Julie Ann Rodelas slay, but boyfriend found guilty\nMore foreign brands seen coming to PH shores in 2025\nNegros Occidental declares state of calamity after Kanlaon blast\nUS developing topical vaccine that you rub on the skin\nMOST READ\nComelec exempts 48 projects from election ban\n3 schools have highest percentage of passers among first-time bar exam takers\nBar exam 2024: List of successful examinees\nPhilHealth: P138M allocation for 2025 anniversary not Christmas party\nFollow\n@FMangosingINQ\non Twitter\n-->\nView comments",

We welcome any country who is willing to contribute to the regional connectivity and integration to join the BRI,\u201d Tan added.\nAlthough China initiated the BRI as a platform, it is \u201cowned and equally participated\u201d by all countries who take part in it under the guiding principle of \u201cconsultation and cooperation for shared benefits\u201d with no projects being imposed on any country, he said.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nCompletely groundless\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nTan denied accusations that Beijing was using the BRI for debt-trap diplomacy in which a creditor country would intentionally extend excessive credit to a debtor country in order to extract economic or political concessions from the debtor when it becomes unable to pay its loans.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\n\u201cThe so-called China debt trap is completely groundless,\u201d he said. \u201cThe BRI is a \u2018pie\u2019 for everyone to share, not a \u2018pitfall\u2019 that hinders development.\u201d\nTan and other speakers at forum, including former President and ex-Speaker Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo and Communications Secretary Martin Andanar, focused on how the BRI could be strengthened by more people-to-people ties among participating countries.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nTan said the \u201cstrategic goal\u201d for the BRI was to \u201cconnect diverse cultures and different civilizations for peaceful coexistence\u201d by promoting extensive cultural, academic, media and other people-to-people exchanges.\nAndanar acknowledged Chinese investments in President Duterte\u2019s \u201cBuild, Build, Build\u201d infrastructure program as part of the BRI\u2019s 21st Century Maritime Silk Road aspect, which entails economic collaboration among Asia\u2019s maritime and archipelagic states.\nPraise from GMA\nArroyo lauded the efforts of China, which she said was poised to become the world\u2019s largest economy, in becoming \u201ca powerful advocate for safeguarding and developing globalization.\u201d\nIn dealing with smaller countries, China should play the role of a \u201csenior uncle to many nephews,\u201d with both having responsibilities to work for the common good of the family, she said.\nFor China and the Philippines to have a \u201cgood state-to-state relations\u201d there must be close people-to-people exchanges and heart-to-heart communication, Tan said.

        "content": "What do we want? Do we believe it is possible to have a crime-free society, where crime is the exception and not the norm?\nLet us look at where the world is today with regards to crime. Look at what we can infer and conclude from the map (Global Peace Index) &nbsp;above. There are some highly developed and rich countries with high crime, and relatively poor countries that have a low incidence of crime.&nbsp;Crime is not a function of income, race, religion, and ethnicity. What, therefore, is the determinant of peace and order?&nbsp;How can we create the vision of a crime free and prosperous country and make it a reality in our lifetime?\nFirst, the key is understanding crime and its genesis. Crime is not hereditary, nor is it congenital. There is no one who is born a criminal. The evidence is that human beings are born basically good, learning like a blank slate to survive within their environment.\nYour subscription could not be saved.

I agree to the\nTerms of Use\nand acknowledge that I have read the\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nCrime is learned with the loss of self-respect, that is born from a degrading environment. When we understand how an individual\u2019s personal ethic interacts and is molded with the moral code of a group or a society, we can then create&nbsp;a law enforcement&nbsp;and justice system that can effectively stop crime and rehabilitate criminals. Moreover, we can build a society that can prevent and avoid the development of criminals in the first place.\nThere are two essential factors:\nADVERTISEMENT\nInternal-Personal\n:\n&nbsp;\nLoss of self-respect \u2014 when one takes on a personal belief, or ethic, that one cannot survive without taking on a victim-victimizer identity; when one is bewildered, unable to learn, believing&nbsp;oneself&nbsp;as stupid.\nExternal-Social\n: When the internal identity is molded from an environment where one is continuously and systematically abused, suppressed, degraded, tortured, or beaten down. It is when society turns a blind eye, condones, accepts and agrees to a moral code that these behaviors are normal.&nbsp;As an example, you can have a socially prevalent practice of&nbsp;adultism (oppression of children by adults) and sexism (oppression of women by men).\nHow to create a crime-free and peaceful society? A socio-economic model inspired by Francis Fukuyama, from his book\nPolitical Order and Political Decay\n, offers a framework for&nbsp;development that&nbsp;has been historically observed. It is a society governed by the rule of law and with an economic system that allows for a relatively equal opportunity to prosper. Such a society is grounded on commonly accepted ideals or values; a moral code that is enacted into laws and enforced within a justice system. We understand in these Three Components of Development, how a peaceful and prosperous society can be built from a foundation of ethics and values. The&nbsp;history of civilizations have&nbsp;shown their rise and fall from the strength and weakness of the ethics and values in society.\nADVERTISEMENT\n&nbsp;\nGlobal best practices\nSignificant crime decline has&nbsp;been seen in the large urban center of New York City with its Broken Windows theory of policing and public order. Colombia, meanwhile, has the Two-Fisted Approach of Law Enforcement with Values Education.\nMy own personal experience in the rehabilitation of prisoners and reversing&nbsp;recidivism&nbsp;in the California Penal System has inspired me. With the use of a common sense guide to ethical behavior, in the booklet\nThe Way to Happiness\n, I saw a practical and effective methodology. Validated evidence shows that with a simple yet powerful, ethics and values approach, it is possible to reverse criminality and create a social order that is virtually crime free.\nThe global best practices of The Way to Happiness, together with moral codes, like the 4-Way Test of Rotarians, is what creates the foundation for sustainable development that is crime and corruption free.\nA values formation and Moral Recovery Campaign that is institutionalized by Government and Civil Society, in a nonreligious and nonpolitical way,&nbsp;is the sustainable foundation that works. It requires a leadership resolve and quick action by government and civil society.\nAs such, there is an initiative to reactivate-rename the 2004 Philippine Executive Order 314, and updated as the Presidential Commission on Values-Formation, Ethics, and Happiness, CVEH. This aligns with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, and will distinguish the Philippines as the first ASEAN country and 6th in the world, that has a focus on measuring the GNH, Gross National Happiness Index of the country.\nWith understanding and insight, a consultation process with the 600 attendees of the recent Anti-Crime Summit was formulated for resolutions and action steps. The goal is to help guide government and Civil Society with action points to Stopping Crime&nbsp;Against&nbsp;Women and against&nbsp;crime in general.\nThree Resolutions&nbsp;where asked&nbsp;in each of the 7 Areas:&nbsp;Legislation; Enforcement; Communications; Ethics and Values; Economics; Culture and Sports; Family and Marriage. This will be submitted as the 21 IKAW Resolutions. I will discuss the 21 Resolutions in my next column.\n(Excerpted from a speech delivered in the Anti-Crime Summit,&nbsp;IKAW (Ihinto&nbsp;Krimen Against&nbsp;Women held on April 23, 2019 at the Manila Hotel. The Summit was organized by the Public Attorney\u2019s Office, PAO, and the Volunteers&nbsp;Against&nbsp;Crime and Corruption, VACC and supported by the Presidential Anti-Crime Commission, Department of Interior and Local Government, Rotary International District 3830, and the Way to Happiness Philippines Foundation.)\nJorge \u201cJerry\u201d Perez de&nbsp;Tagle, lives in the US and the Philippines, is an author and change management consultant for the private and public sector.

        "content": "Ramon Tulfo\u2019s rant against our supposedly lazy countrymen coupled with unfair comparison with hardworking Chinese has reaped a whirlwind of online bashing from the onion-skinned who felt alluded to, and those who take every opportunity to contradict whatever Tulfo says or writes. Tulfo took refuge under the National Hero\u2019s overcoat, tweeting: \u201cTo those who have been bashing me. Read Jose Rizal\u2019s essay about the indolence of the Filipino in his time. Thank you!\u201d\nFor a moment, bashing stopped, but resumed when those who looked up Rizal\u2019s essay realized Tulfo had not read beyond the essay title!\n\u201cSobre la indolencia de los Filipinos (On the indolence of the Filipinos)\u201d is a very long, and at times angry, essay by Rizal that saw print in La Solidaridad in March 1890. From abroad and across time, Rizal reacted to the charge, from the Spanish colonial masters, that Filipinos were indolent or lazy. Rizal did not condemn it, rather he explained it:\nArticle continues after this advertisement\n\u201cWe must confess that indolence does actually and positively exist there; only that, instead of holding it to be the cause of the backwardness and the trouble, we regard it as the effect of the trouble and the backwardness, by fostering the development of a lamentable predisposition.\u201d\nFEATURED STORIES\nOPINION\nUrgent action needed vs online piracy as Congress session nears end\nOPINION\nLife has shortened\nOPINION\nThe gift of second chances\nTropical climate is a major factor, Rizal explained: \u201cNature knows this and like a just mother has therefore made the earth more fertile, more productive, as a compensation. An hour\u2019s work under that burning sun, in the midst of pernicious influences springing from nature in activity, is equal to a day\u2019s work in a temperate climate.\u201d\nIt is the Spaniard who is lazy, argued Rizal, as they detest manual labor and live surrounded by Filipino servants who \u201cnot only exist to take off their shoes for them but even to fan them!\u201d His analysis as a physician and historian led to primary sources that proved Filipinos in pre-Spanish times were not so: \u201cIndolence in the Philippines is a chronic malady, but not a hereditary one. The Filipinos have not always been what they are.\u201d\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nUsing his notes gathered from the British Library from 1888 to 1889 while at work on his annotated edition of Antonio de Morga\u2019s 1609 \u201cSucesos de las islas Filipinas (Events of the Philippine Islands),\u201d Rizal presented early accounts like the \u201cZhu Fan Zhi,\u201d published by Chau Ju-kua in 1225, which described the industry and honesty of the Filipinos before the Spanish conquest; and Antonio Pigafetta\u2019s chronicle of the Magellan expedition, regarding the capture and ransom of the Chief of Paragua. Wielding history as a weapon, Rizal asked sarcastically: \u201cHow did the industrious infidel become indolent centuries later when he was Christianized? Why did they forget their proud past and become indolent?\u201d\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nRizal also blamed the sorry state of the colony. The galleon trade had cut off existing trade between the Philippines and China and Southeast Asia, the trade monopoly running Filipino traders and artisans out of business. Furthermore, the lure of the galleon trade led to the neglect of commerce and agriculture. People were conscripted to work in the shipyards, forced to build roads and buildings with little or no pay, decimating the population and killing their natural love for work. Their goods and services were taken by force, such that they simply refused to work more only to have their products taken for free, paid cheaply, or so heavily taxed that these ended up not worth the trouble.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nPeople were also insecure about their liberty, with false accusations and the like.\nGambling was another factor, because it bred \u201cdislike for steady and difficult toil by its promise of sudden wealth and its appeal to the emotions, with the lotteries,\u201d said Rizal. Finally, he pointed out the failure of education, which was more focused on religion than on the secular and useful, with the exception of the Jesuits and the Dominican Benavides. \u201cFrom his birth until he sinks into his grave, the training of the native is brutalizing, depressive and antihuman (the word \u2018inhuman\u2019 is not sufficiently explanatory: whether or not the Academy admits it, let it go).\u201d\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nRizal did not just rant, he provided a solution: education and the formation of what he called a \u201cnational sentiment.\u201d Rizal left us with 25 volumes of writings to instruct and inspire, but alas, he wrote a lot for a nation that does not read him. It took a foreigner, Syed Hussein Alatas, to build on Rizal\u2019s essay and publish \u201cThe Myth of the Lazy Native\u201d (1977), disproving as myth the laziness of the Malays, Filipinos and Javanese in colonial times.\nComments are welcome at aocampo@ateneo.edu\nYour subscription could not be saved.

        "content": "New York, one of the world\u2019s most future-proofed hubs, together with San Francisco, Silicon Valley, and London, has top technology centers with vibrant tech and creative sectors.Photo source: Patch\nWe live in a highly urbanized world.\nIn 1950 around 30 percent of the world\u2019s population lived in cities.&nbsp; Today, that figure has risen to 54 percent.&nbsp; By 2050, more than 75 percent or 6.1 billion people will live in cities. By 2100, that figure is projected to jump to 84 percent. This urban migration will happen mostly in fast developing countries.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThis trend presents a great challenge to existing cities which must take proactive steps now to future-proof themselves.\nFEATURED STORIES\nBUSINESS\nMore foreign brands seen coming to PH shores in 2025\nBUSINESS\nGlobal Dominion: Simplifying financing to empower every Filipino\nBUSINESS\nInternational group kicks off infrastructure investment drive for PH\nWhat exactly is future-proofing?\nFuture-proofing is the process of anticipating the future and developing strategies to minimize the negative impact and stresses of future events such as floods, unaffordable housing, terrorist attacks and so on.&nbsp; Future-proofing is used in the medical industry, in electronics, industrial design, and, more recently, in designs for climate change.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nCities can act to future-proof themselves to reap economic and social benefits, as well as environmental ones.&nbsp; This can include integrated urban planning, sustainable transportation systems, water and waste management, and new sources of energy.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nTo respond to these challenges, an integrated multidisciplinary approach is needed.&nbsp; This will require tapping the skills of various experts from different disciplines, such as architects, planners, engineers, climate scientists, ecologists, economists and entrepreneurs who will work together to create resilient cities.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nHere are some future-proofing strategies:\n1 Promote wellness\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nCities must be designed to create a lifestyle that promotes wellness over and above economic factors. We need safer streets, a cleaner environment, and secure places for working and living.\nBuild on appropriate sites\nCities must consider disaster risk assessment when developing communities and building sites to prevent or minimize danger to the health and well-being of people.\nGo for integrated development\nCities must adopt an integrated approach to development, which they did in Freiburg, the \u201cSolar Capital of Europe.\u201d\nFreiburg is a German city in southwest Germany\u2019s Black Forest area whose city planning department created a compact community where people live close together. Freiburg\u2019s main goal was to create a green city that balances working and living areas which are integrated with green spaces and neighborhood centers for social interaction, cultural events and other related activities.\nOne thing that struck me was the energy index of 15 Kwhr/sqm/year of homes in Freiburg.\nDevelop green open spaces\nCities of the future must invest in an integrated system of green open spaces and public spaces which help improve liveability, support vibrant city life, promote community life and decrease the heat island effect.&nbsp; Cities of the future will have plenty of urban farming.\nBuild a sustainable transport system\nProviding fast, cheap and clean public transport early in a city\u2019s development is a major factor in the future proofing of cities. An efficient transport system promotes good health and saves energy.\nProvide for the elderly\nWith a growing aging population due to declining fertility rates and rising life expectancy, the aged population is currently at its highest level. Future cities must consider that people worldwide prefer to stay at home as they get older. Cities must be upgraded and regenerated to be walkable for all ages, especially the elderly.\nIn Singapore, there are now residential condominiums that offer units designed for three generations of families living side by side.\nConserve water\nCities must realize that water is a valuable resource that must be used efficiently. Collecting, reusing, and returning water back to the environment is one way of doing this. Many ancient civilizations have disappeared when water sources were depleted due to the mishandling of such a precious resource.\nCities can learn from South Korea\u2019s experience when Cheonggyechan stream reopened after having been previously covered by a highway. Thanks to the project, the average temperature of the area has dropped by 3.6 degrees in comparison to other parts of Seoul. It also helped revive the traditional pedestrian route of the city by connecting the stream with the old resource areas.\nEstablish green standards\nCities must be constantly monitored using building technology standards that are regularly updated to cover all typologies of building types and neighborhood developments.&nbsp; The goal is to continue to create and improve the quality of life in the cities.\nDevelop resilience\nAn automated warning system in the built infrastructure protects the city from events such as earthquakes. To protect a city from obsolescence, the city must create new infrastructure while upgrading the existing stock of decaying and obsolete infrastructure.\nLevel up to a globalized, digitized economy\nDevelopers can help in future proofing cities by producing projects that facilitate the creativity, innovation, and sustainable communities that are now in demand.&nbsp; The world\u2019s most future-proofed hubs \u2013San Francisco, Silicon Valley, New York and London\u2013 have top technology centers with vibrant tech and creative sectors.&nbsp; They have a large concentration of start-up companies with fast expanding technology and global connectivity.\nDemocratize city planning\nThe democratic city gives the citizens a say on how their city and culture evolves.&nbsp; So as not to restrict development, a well selected group is needed to mediate between a bottom-top and top-bottom approach to the design and development of city space.\nYour subscription could not be saved.

The network held its third general assembly in Istanbul on Oct. 19-22.\nYunus Emre Enstitu\u0308su\u0308 head and GPDNet president Seref Ates\nThe National Commission for Culture and the Arts (NCCA), which has established Sentro Rizal in different Philippine diplomatic missions abroad mainly to teach children of migrant Filipino workers Philippine language and culture, is a founding member of GPDNet. During the Istanbul meeting, it was represented by National Artist for Literature and Komisyon ng Wika chair Virgilio Almario, who also heads the NCCA, and Mary Anne Luis of the NCCA &nbsp;International Affairs Office.\nThe author (left) with National Artist and NCCA chair Virgilio Almario (right) and NCCA officer Mary Anne Luis at Istanbul\u2019s bookstore row across the Grand Bazaar, filled with Turkish flags in the run-up to Republic Day.\nYEE, the Turkish counterpart of the NCCA\u2019s Sentro Rizal, is named after the 13th-century Anatolian poet-mystic Yunus Emre, who composed his works in the spoken Turkish of his own day and region rather than in Persian or Arabic. He is thus considered a founding father of the Turkish language and literature.\nTurkish bravura pianist Tuluyhan Ugurlu at the Grand Bazaar\nAccording to professor Seref Ates, head of the institute, YEE now has 54 Turkish centers in 43 countries across five continents, holding regular instructions and programs on Turkology and the Turkish language.\nAtes is the term president of the GPDNet until 2019.\nAtes gives NCCA chair Almario Turkey\u2019s appreciation token.\nFor 2016-2017 during Turkey\u2019s first year as president, Ates and YEE organized the Anatolian civilization tour and the international storytelling session, \u201cTales for Everyone.\u201d\nAtes congratulates the Cultural Village Foundation of Qatar as new GPDNet member\nHeld earlier this year, \u201cTales\u201d featured storytellers from GPDNet member-countries gathering in Ankara, Turkey\u2019s capital where YEE is based, and holding storytelling sessions. Making a splash was Philippine actor Bodjie Pascua who colorfully told the Samal folk story, \u201cManik Buangsi.\u201d\nAtes said the civilization tour and storytelling session involving people from different cultures and nationalities underscored how culture could be used for diplomacy and international understanding.\ntes with Jolanta Zabarskaite of the Institute of the Lithuanian Language, inducted as GPDNet associate member\n\u201cThe GPDNet was founded on the belief that soft power contributes to the creation of innovative policy-oriented solutions to issues affecting many countries,\u201d said Ates. GPDNet, he added, is \u201ca platform that contributes to international understanding through cultural and civil-society initiatives.\u201d\nWhen it was established in Korea in 2014, GPDNet was envisioned as a way for \u201cmiddle powers\u201d to employ public diplomacy initiatives, something that had become pressing in the world today, according to Ates and speakers of the opening-day panel discussion on \u201cThe role of culture in bringing polarized and conflicted communities together through public diplomacy.\u201d\nAtes with officer of Comuni- dade Academica para o Desenvolvimento of Mozambique\nBrigitte Nacos of Columbia University noted that the rise of global communication and social media has been both a boon and a bane.\nWhile aiding communication across borders and transforming the world into a \u201cglobal village,\u201d as media guru Marshall McLuhan put it, it had also resulted in reception problems, especially since \u201cthe same news message, the same narrative, the same image can be and is perceived very differently in different political, cultural and religious settings around the globe.\u201d\nShe warned against \u201cstereotypes\u201d fostered by global communication.\n\u201cWhen western leaders speak of the \u2018war against terrorism,\u2019 many Westerners are likely to think of terrorists of the al-Qaida or Isis variety,\u201d Nacos explained. \u201cMany Muslims, among those in the western diaspora, are likely to think that the \u2018war against terrorism\u2019 are code words for \u2018war against Islam.\u2019\u201d\nNacos said that instead of \u201cgovernment-directed information,\u201d public diplomacy should shift its focus on \u201ccultural exchanges promoting language, culture, the arts and sports\u201d as well as on \u201ceducational or people-to-people contacts, especially among students and scholars.\u201d\nShe cited collaborative projects such as the West-Eastern Divan Orchestra for young people, founded 17 years ago by Palestinian scholar Edward Said and Jewish conductor Daniel Barenboim, that continues to bring young musicians from Palestine and Israel together to work for peace by holding concerts around the world.\n\u201cKnowing more about different peoples and races and cultures and religions based on personal experiences, meetings, collaborations,\u201d Nacos said, \u201cwill not prevent disagreements\u2014but they can help to understand others and temper our actions and reactions.\u201d\nNeville Bolt, director of the King\u2019s Centre for Strategic Communications in London, said the world is affected by a \u201cclub sandwich of geopolitical issues\u201d driven by \u201cglobalization, easternization, Islamization and mass migration.\u201d\nBolt said tensions unleashed by these forces may be aggravated by the social media, which trigger \u201ca pandemonium of opinions and consumption.\u201d\nHe explained that the social media have given rise to the \u201cera of the image,\u201d in which meaning is given shorthand, reductionist treatment, if not altogether given the short shrift, resulting in \u201cviral engagement\u201d and confusion.\n\u201cWhat we have now are chaotic, nonlinear societies,\u201d the British scholar said. \u201cThe unpredictable rule our lives.\u201d He said public diplomacy must employ the old virtues of \u201ctact and intelligence\u201d while also daring new strategies in the spirit of 13th-century Muslim poet Rumi\u2019s declaration, \u201cNow is the time for new things!\u201d\nAmbassador Luis Palma Castillo from Chile emphasized the need for diplomatic initiatives to stop geopolitical problems from deteriorating.\nTurkish philosopher Bekir Karliga, cochair of the Alliance of Civilizations, said the world was \u201cfacing not a clash, but a crisis, of civilization,\u201d owing to modern, secularist and consumerist society\u2019s ignorance about the \u201cwisdom of the past.\u201d And \u201cignorance is manipulated by many parties,\u201d resulting in \u201chate, terror.\u201d\nTurkey in fact is cosponsor with Spain of the United Nations Alliance of Civilizations (AC), a 2005 initiative by then Turkish prime minister and now President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. AC seeks to galvanize international action against extremism through the forging of international, intercultural and interreligious dialogue and cooperation. It seeks to defuse tensions between the Western and Islamic worlds.\nCD-book of international storytelling festival in Ankara organized by GPDNet\nRepublic Day\nThe GPDNet meeting took place a week before Turkey marked its 95th anniversary as a republic on Oct. 29.\nPresident Erdogan, who has consolidated his hold on government since the coup attempt last year, led the Republic Day celebration.\nAlthough critics have warned against his alleged \u201cneo-Ottoman\u201d proclivities, Erdogan has styled himself as a champion against the West\u2019s imperialist excesses.\nDuring the official commemoration on Oct. 23 of the death anniversary of Bosnia-Herzegovina\u2019s first president Alija Izetbegovic, a friend of Erdogan\u2019s, the Turkish president lashed out at \u201cimperialist bloodsuckers.\u201d\nTalks on Turkish accession to the European Union (EU) were suspended after the 2016 coup and due to alleged human rights abuses there, and the stalled talks had further riled the Turkish president.\nErdogan declared European civilization dead as he criticized European countries\u2019 indifference toward the humanitarian tragedies in Syria and Myanmar, where Buddhist military offensives had driven out of the country tens of thousands of Muslim Rohingyas.\n\u201cEurope died in Bosnia and it was buried in Syria,\u201d said Erdogan. \u201cThe bodies of innocent children washing up ashore are the tombstones of Western civilization. Unfortunately in the last seven years, the old European values have been discredited and destroyed by the very owners of these values.\u201d\nIronically enough, 2017 also marks the 30th year of Turkey as a \u201cnon-EU member.\u201d Turkey had formally applied for EU membership in 1987.\nCultural diplomacy in action\nDespite the rather charged state of affairs in Turkey, GPDNet members showed plenty of initiatives at cultural diplomacy.\nThe Chiang Ching Kuo Foundation for International Scholarly Exchange of Taiwan made a demonstration of traditional Chinese tea preparation of the native oolong leaves, which delighted Ates and the other delegates.\nDelegates also sampled Ottoman flavors at Konyaki restaurant right at the ancient Topkapi palace of the Ottoman sultans overlooking the Bosphorus.\nGPDNet delegates gave a standing ovation to the dynamic playing of famous Turkish concert pianist Tuluyhan Ugurlu at the Grand Bazaar on Oct. 22, exactly a week before Republic Day.\nAside from the Grand Bazaar and Topkapi, delegates also toured the Spice Market, Blue Mosque and, of course, the Hagia Sophia, the \u201cChurch of Divine Wisdom.\u201d\nAnd they took home with them baklava, the many varieties of the \u201cTurkish delight\u201d or pastry. Which should show that cultural diplomacy is the baklava of diplomatic initiatives to heal the world of its geopolitical ills.\nAside from YEE, NCCA and Chiang Ching Kuo Foundation, founding members of the GPDNet are the Korea Foundation, Balassi Institute (Hungary), National Institute for Cultural Orientation (Nigeria), Singapore International Foundation, Camoes Instituto (Portugal), Swedish Institute and Adam Mickiewicz Institute (Poland),\nFormally accepted as a full member in the Instanbul meeting was the Cultural Village Foundation of Qatar.\nAccepted as associate members were the Institute of the Lithuanian Language and Comunidade Academica para o Desenvolvimento of Mozambique.\nRead more",

We also welcome the participation of Secretary General Antonio Guterres of the United Nations, President Jim Yong Kim of the World Bank Group, Managing Director Christine Lagarde of the International Monetary Fund. The Leaders Roundtable was chaired by President Xi Jinping of the People\u2019s Republic of China.??General Context\nWe are mindful that the world economy is undergoing profound changes, presenting both opportunities and challenges. This is an era of opportunity, where countries continue to aspire for peace, development and cooperation. The UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development with the set of Sustainable Development Goals at its core provides a new blueprint of international cooperation.\nIn this context, we welcome bilateral, triangular, regional and multilateral cooperation where countries place emphasis on eradicating poverty, creating jobs, addressing the consequences of international financial crises, promoting sustainable development, and advancing market-based industrial transformation and economic diversification. We note with appreciation that various development strategies and connectivity cooperation initiatives have been put forward, providing broad space for strengthening international cooperation.\nWe further recognize the challenges that the world economy faces. While it is currently experiencing modest recovery, downside risks remain. The growth of global trade and investment remains tempered, and the rules-based multilateral trading regime is yet to be strengthened. All countries, especially developing ones, still face common challenges of eradicating poverty, promoting inclusive and sustained economic growth, and achieving sustainable development.\nNoting that the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road (The Belt and Road Initiative) can create opportunities amidst challenges and changes, we welcome and support the Belt and Road Initiative to enhance connectivity between Asia and Europe, which is also open to other regions such as Africa and South America. By providing important opportunities for countries to deepen cooperation, it has achieved positive outcomes and has future potential to deliver more benefits as an important international initiative.\nWe also emphasize the opportunities which can be created by communication and coordination among other global, regional and national frameworks and initiatives for promoting cooperation in connectivity and sustainable development, such as 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, Addis Ababa Action Agenda, Agenda 2063 of the African Union, Ancient Civilizations Forum, APEC Connectivity Blueprint, ASEAN Community Vision 2025, Asia-Europe Meeting and its group on path-finder of connectivity, Caravanserai Customs Initiative, China and Central and Eastern European Countries Cooperation, China-Europe Land-Sea Express Route, East-West Middle Corridor Initiative, EU-China Connectivity Platform, EU Eastern Partnership, Eurasian partnership based on the principles of equality, openness and transparency, Initiative for the Integration of Regional Infrastructure in South America, Master Plan on ASEAN Connectivity 2025, Main Directions for Economic Development of the Eurasian Economic Union until 2030, Paris Agreement on Climate Change, Trans-European Transport Networks, Western Balkans 6 Connectivity Agenda, WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement.\nWe reaffirm our shared commitment to build open economy, ensure free and inclusive trade, oppose all forms of protectionism including in the framework of the Belt and Road Initiative. We endeavor to promote a universal, rules-based, open, non-discriminatory and equitable multilateral trading system with WTO at its core.\nCooperation Objectives\nWe stand for enhancing international cooperation including the Belt and Road Initiative and various development strategies, by building closer collaboration partnerships, which include advancing North-South, South-South, and triangular cooperation.??\nWe reiterate the importance of expanding economic growth, trade and investment based on level-playing field, on market rules and on universally recognized international norms. We welcome the promotion of industrial cooperation, scientific and technological innovation, and regional economic cooperation and integration so as to increase, inter alia, the integration and participation of micro, small and medium enterprises in global value chains. Attention should be paid to tax and fiscal policies, prioritizing growth and productive investment.??\nWe stand for strengthening physical, institutional and people-to-people connectivity among all countries. The least developed countries, landlocked developing countries, small island developing states and middle-income countries deserve special attention to remove bottlenecks of development and achieve effective connectivity.\nWe endeavor to expand people-to-people exchanges, promote peace, justice, social cohesion, inclusiveness, democracy, good governance, the rule of law, human rights, gender equality and women empowerment; work together to fight against corruption and bribery in all their forms; to be more responsive to all the needs of those in vulnerable situations such as, children, persons with disabilities and older persons; and help improve global economic governance, and ensure equal access by all to development opportunities and benefits.\nWe are determined to protect the planet from degradation, including through taking urgent action on climate change and encouraging all parties which have ratified it to fully implement the Paris Agreement, managing the natural resources in an equitable and sustainable manner, conserving and sustainably using oceans and seas, freshwater resources, as well as forests, mountains and drylands, protecting biodiversity, ecosystems and wildlife, combating desertification and land degradation so as to achieving sustainable development in its three dimensions in a balanced and integrated manner.\nWe encourage the involvement of governments, international and regional organizations, the private sector, civil society and citizens in fostering and promoting friendship, mutual understanding and trust.\nCooperation Principles\nWe uphold the spirit of peace, cooperation, openness, transparency, inclusiveness, equality, mutual learning, mutual benefit and mutual respect by strengthening cooperation on the basis of extensive consultation and the rule of law, joint efforts, shared benefits and equal opportunities for all. In this context we highlight the following principles guiding our cooperation, in accordance with our respective national laws and policies:\na) Consultation on an equal footing: Honoring the purposes and principles of the UN Charter and international law including respecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of countries;

        "content": "Last April 22, countries around the world bonded to celebrate Earth Day to remember and appreciate Mother Earth\u2019s life-giving abundance and promote her beauty. The observance of Earth Day began in 1970 through the initiative of Sen. Gaylord Nelson of Wisconsin.\nOn April 4, 1990, the Senate adopted the resolution I filed, urging President Corazon Aquino to declare April 22, 1990, as Earth Day. The resolution was meant to reflect our growing commitment to the conservation of our environment. Its adoption filled our hearts with immense hope.\nThat was 27 years ago. Today, however, Earth Day has become an observance of all 194 countries to save Mother Earth from the ultimate disaster\u2014climate change, which could overwhelm mankind sooner than we expect, unless we reduce and finally remove carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases (GHGs) from the atmosphere.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThe UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says that a concentration of 3,100 billion metric tons of GHGs in the atmosphere has caused the overheating of the whole Earth by an average 1.3\u00b0C higher than before the industrial revolution. This overheating is melting the polar caps, the ancient glaciers of the Himalayas, leading to the rising of the oceans and the severe and more frequent typhoons and storms\u2014and great droughts as well.\nFEATURED STORIES\nOPINION\nUrgent action needed vs online piracy as Congress session nears end\nOPINION\nLife has shortened\nOPINION\nThe gift of second chances\nThe global environment that we sought to enhance has deteriorated\u2014much to the anguish of leaders, causing the suffering of populations across the world. Increasing carbon emissions, the result of uncontrolled use of coal and hydrocarbons, are creating climate impacts that are catastrophic:\nIn Bolivia, Lake Poopo\u2014which used to cover an area of 1,000 square kilometers\u2014has dried up. In Africa, Lake Chad has shrunk by more than 90 percent since 1963.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nProlonged drought and extreme temperatures are taking terrible tolls on food crops.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nIn sections of Syria, Turkey, Iraq and Iran, a three-year drought has led to enormous crop failures and the loss of livestock. And in\nMindanao and the Cagayan Valley, we have suffered intermittent droughts.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nDeforestation, removal of vegetation and exploitative agriculture have degraded lands, turning these into deserts. In China, the deserts have expanded by 21,000 square miles since 1975, crowding out cropland and whipping up devastating sandstorms. In our own country, these have led to typhoons and tropical storms that are becoming more intense, exacting a higher toll on lives and properties.\nHaving observed Earth Day 2017, we recognize that climate change is a threat multiplier. It is undermining the economic and political stability of nations. And ecological disasters are wreaking turmoil in many societies to the point where huge numbers of people are being displaced, becoming \u201cenvironmental migrants\u201d or \u201cclimate refugees.\u201d\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nEarth Day was a consciousness awakening to protect life, to reduce CO2, to reduce the overheating of the Earth. Rapid carbon cuts will curb severe climate change. Governments, communities, individuals must all join hands to reduce CO2.\nWe appeal to our people to keep their communities clean, to stop the pollution of our rivers and lakes, to grow trees or mangroves along our coastal areas, and to teach our children to love and protect our environment.\nOur government could now ramp up the transition to a climate economy with our ratification of the Paris Accord that took effect last Earth Day. It could begin to promote a systematic shift to alternative fuels mix and create the infrastructure necessary to encourage and connect a wide range of climate actions.\nUnless we reduce CO2 the overheating of the Earth will continue and if it reaches 2\u00b0C mankind cannot stop this heating anymore.\nIt could mean the gradual destruction of our life-support system and, inevitably, the human civilization.\nEarth Day was a day that raised consciousness to love and protect Mother Earth, and to save the generations of man.\nEarth Day was a celebration of life!\nYour subscription could not be saved.

The siege ended on June 2, 1899, nearly a year after the end of&nbsp;Spain\u2019s war with Philippine revolutionaries. TARRA QUISMUNDO\nBALER, Aurora\u2014It was a moment when a conquered people could have finally taken revenge. The enemy was stricken by disease, weakened by hunger and unaware that the war had long ended.\nBut as soon as the Spanish soldiers holed up inside Baler Church decided to lay down their arms on June 2, 1899, they walked out, not into a firing line, but into the welcoming arms of Filipino revolutionaries who chose friendship over retribution.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThe cordial conclusion to the 11-month siege that was Spain\u2019s last stand in the Philippines was recalled in solemn rites here on Tuesday, as the National Historical Commission of the Philippines (NHCP) and the Angara family led the celebration of the 14th Philippine-Spanish Friendship Day in this quaint surfing town by the Pacific.\nFEATURED STORIES\nGLOBALNATION\nPCG: China using AIS spoofing to mislead public and stir confusion\nGLOBALNATION\nPH asserts rights over Bajo de Masinloc at UN General Assembly\nGLOBALNATION\n'Aid for Kristine-hit Batangas': Presidential assistance for farmers, fisherfolk, families\n\u201cIn the long history of the world, there are many sieges \u2026 where the victors killed all the losers. Except in Baler. The victors, the Katipuneros, were even ordered by President Emilio Aguinaldo to give them safe passage as friends rather than as enemies,\u201d former Sen. Edgardo Angara said of the enduring story.\nThe Spanish soldiers, 35 survivors out of the 50 at the beginning of the siege, were escorted back to Manila.&nbsp; They left Manila on July 20, 1899, and arrived in Barcelona 12 days later.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nIcy relations\nArticle continues after this advertisement\n\u201cThe siege of Baler is the only siege where the victors spared the lives of the losers,\u201d said the former lawmaker of his historic hometown where the curtains fell on the Spanish empire\u2019s three-century reign in the Philippines.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nAngara pushed for the passage of the Philippine-Spanish Friendship Day law in 2002, a measure credited for helping thaw what for a long time were icy relations between the two nations.\nThe commemoration has been held in the town annually every June 30, but this year, the rites were moved a few days later in deference to the inauguration ceremonies of President Duterte.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nSpanish Charg\u00e9 d\u2019Affaires Guillermo Escribano and Commission on Higher Education Chair Patricia Licuanan, guests of honor at the event, laid a wreath at the Baler Church where a marker honors the historic turning point 117 years ago.\nTo this day, Angara said, the Philippines is the only former Hispanic colony that formally celebrates its friendship with Spain in commemorative rites.\n\u201cIt\u2019s part of our heritage. We cannot discard it, whether we like it or not. It\u2019s my attempt at reminding the young generation that (the Spanish colonizers) also did us some good: (They gave us) our Western outlook and Western values. And that\u2019s why we assimilate so easily in Western civilizations,\u201d Angara said, referring to the 11-million-strong Filipino diaspora.\n\u201cThis was the last point of contact between the Spanish empire and colonial Philippines. It\u2019s really part of our history we shouldn\u2019t forget,\u201d said Angara\u2019s son, Sen. Juan Edgardo Angara.\nFor NHCP Chair Maria Serena Diokno, the Filipinos\u2019 gesture of goodwill toward their former conquerors showed that the revolutionaries had \u201ca sense of justice and fairness.\u201d\n\u201cThe war with Spain was over, we had a new enemy, the United States, (so) what do we do with them? Throw them in jail?\u201d Diokno said on the sidelines of the July 5 rites.\n\u201cOK, we fought them, they oppressed us for 300 years, but that was over. Do we hit our enemy just when he is already helpless on the ground? That\u2019s not how Filipinos are. We even help them get up,\u201d Diokno added.\nTrade on uptrend\nBaler Mayor Nelianto Bihasa described the end of the siege as a moment when two warring sides stood side by side \u201cas equals, no longer as master and slave.\u201d\n\u201c[The siege] was ended just as then President Aguinaldo had wished: In a climate of friendship and generosity, and not in confrontation, vengeance or resentment,\u201d Escribano said before government officials, business leaders, members of the diplomatic corps, local residents and students at the Plaza de Baler.\nNearly a decade and a half since Filipino-Hispanic friendship was first commemorated, relations between the two sides have been on an uptrend, from trade and investment to culture and education.\nEconomic cooperation between the two nations has brought in P9.2 billion in investments to the Philippines since 2003, according to the younger Angara.&nbsp; The country\u2019s Spanish links also opened doors to further trade with the European Union, he added.\nThis, from \u201czero\u201d in 2002 just before the passage of the law, said the elder Angara. \u201cThere was really zero relations. We started on a clean slate\u2014moving on, moving forward, rather than just regretting and blaming our past,\u201d he said.\nSlow comeback\nWhile the Philippines has largely lost the Spanish language, which was widely spoken in the country during the colonial era, it has been making a slow comeback through language training under the public school system, noted the younger Angara.\nThe senator said some 8,000 students from 80 high schools across the country took Spanish language training in 2015, an initiative that began six years ago. An estimated 200 teachers are gaining proficiency to serve as Spanish language instructors.\nSenator Angara also made references to his father\u2019s initiative to build the Manila-Acapulco Galleon Museum, a shrine to 250 years of colonial-era sea trade between the Philippines and Mexico that was considered to have begun international maritime commerce.\nThe P600-million museum is now under construction at SM Mall of Asia Complex by Manila Bay through funding from the family of shopping mall tycoon Henry Sy.\nFaithful replica\nAn international private sector initiative involving Filipino, Mexican and Spanish architects, designers, naval historians, scholars, architects and shipbuilders, the project aims to build a faithful replica of a galleon used at the time of the trade based on 18th century manuscripts.\nThe replica is estimated to cost at least P230 million. The elder Angara, who is still actively involved in cultural and historical preservation initiatives, and his international team are aiming for a soft opening this year and full operations by January.\nThe younger Angara said in his speech that the museum \u201cwill house our shared trading history that gave rise to modern-day trade and commerce.\u201d\n\u201cA former Spanish minister likened our ties to a tree that has more roots than fruits. It means the roots of our relations are deep, but does it bear fruits? In my view, this is up to us. Personally, I see nothing but opportunities for growth and progress in the Philippine-Spanish relationship. How we harvest these fruits is entirely up to us and the coming generations,\u201d the lawmaker said.\nTVJ\nRELATED STORIES\nAfter centuries-long colonial rule, PH, Spain \u2018partners for life\u2019\nYour subscription could not be saved.

        "content": "Earlier this month,\nINQUIRER.net\nheld a series of interviews with leaders of civil society and the academe based in Davao City. One of them is Fr. Joel Tabora, president of the Ateneo de Davao University, who discussed with us the prospects of a Duterte administration.\nBelow is the full transcript of the interview:\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nJohn Nery,\nINQUIRER.net\nEditor in Chief\n: Good afternoon and welcome to our live interview with the very influential president of the Ateneo de Davao University, Fr. Joel Tabora, SJ. Good afternoon Father.\nFEATURED STORIES\nNEWSINFO\nBar exam 2024: List of successful examinees\nNEWSINFO\n3 schools have highest percentage of passers among first-time bar exam takers\nNEWSINFO\nHouse panel: Ex-president Duterte center of grand criminal enterprise\nFr.\nTabora\n: Good afternoon, John. Good to see you here. Since you were in my classroom.\nNery\n: Back in your presence. Thank you for making time for us on a Sunday afternoon. We have a few questions to ask, and really, most of them have to do with how should we understand the Duterte presidency. Maybe we can start with the very basic question. Duterte is the first ever president from Mindanao. How does the Ateneo de Davao University see this historic achievement?\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nFr.\nTabora\n: I guess first of all we have to say that Ateneo de Davao university does not have an official position on this. Official positions in the university are governed by the Board of Trustees, etc. We have a process. But on the other hand, the Ateneo de Davao is very supportive of the newly elected president. Many of its professors and its students are very very active in the campaign for him, and as we have discussed matters after his election, many are very enthusiastic about wanting to be able to help him succeed as our national leader. And the reason I think is simple. Ateneo de Davao is in Mindanao and there are many hopes that Mindanao once had and they\u2018ve come to rest these hopes in Rodrigo Duterte.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nNow, many of the\u2026outside of the fact that many in this university shall support him in his campaign against crime and his campaign against drugs. Many of our people here are very, very committed to the peace process here. We are very disappointed that despite all the efforts that the Aquino administration made in this regard, which engaged many of us very, very deeply here at the Ateneo de Davao, we got very involved in the peace process under President Aquino, but I guess we were all just very disappointed that in the end, because of unfortunate errors that were made, that the, misunderstandings here and there, that the process did not end up in the peace agreement that we all hoped and prayed for.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nWe really believe that President Duterte can lead the country to a genuine peace agreement with the Muslims. Outside of the fact that he has Muslim blood, we are convinced that he understands the Muslim situation and that he can read, I mean, the political forces within the Muslim groups, better than most leaders, most national leaders in the country. So, we hope that he shall certainly be able to play a big part in bringing peace about. It will be complex and it will probably take a different shape than it took under Aquino because the president is sensitive to the MILF but also to the MNLF and we\u2019ve heard that he is not close to discussing the possibilities of exploring the Sabah claim. So those are things I think that we hope can also be part of a peace agreement that could be more inclusive than it being more just, than it is presented\u2026in the problems that we have in Sulu and Malaysia and Sabah area.\nThe other area where I think, very urgently, people are supporting him with great hope is because in this university, most of our students and our professors are very committed to the environment, you know? Our professors who are environmentalists are willing to risk their lives for the environment and they\u2019ve conducted studies in the environment where they have put their life on the line. That sort of thing. So one of the things that have been very important for our people here is his commitment against large scale mining. Our environmentalists see large scale mining as a huge threat to the environment here, and our water studies have shown that if you have something like the SMI Tampakan Mines allowed here, then it could poison the entire water system of Mindanao because all of these rivers and water bodies are itner connected so we\u2019ve been passionately anti-mining from this university, but it\u2019s never really registered as an environmental issue under the Aquino administration. They\u2019ve been cool on mining and large scale mining because of the returns that the 1995 Mining Act deprives the Philippines of. But they\u2019ve never really said large scale mining is an environmental problem. And it is an environmental problem.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nNery\n: So we\u2019re looking at a, you might say, definition of 4Ps that excites Mindanao. There\u2019s the peace process, there\u2019s the peace and order, there\u2019s the planet, and then there\u2019s also greater participation by Mindanaoans in national government. I\u2019d like to discuss one or two of these Ps, is there anything else aside from this that has gotten Mindanaoans excited in a Duterte presidency?\nFR:\nTabora\n: He\u2019s ours. In a sense, he\u2019s ours. Because I think that\u2019s what, you know, people from Mindanao are saying that we finally have a Mindanaoan president. He\u2019s ours, but I think we all know he\u2019s not ours in the sense that we don\u2019t own him. And we know that we don\u2019t, we cannot manipulate this guy. He has his own way, he has his own style, and he uses his own words, but many of Mindanaoans understand him to be ours, therefore, on our side. You know, to an extent, in Mindanao the so called Manila imperialism is felt over many years, we can say over centuries. The ruler from the north has come and has exploited conditions here, you know, when there was a social problem in Central Luzon, they sent the farmers here and they settled here in these lands. There were resettlement campaigns which were started in the American times, but was also carried over under the Filipino officials in the Commonwealth time and later, the resettlement issues which brought migrants from Luzon into Mindanao, displaced the Mindanaoans from their lands and often through loss they did not understand, and that was certainly very true with the Muslim people here in Mindanao, but was also true with the indigenous people in Mindanao.\nSo, the Mindanaoans feel, finally we have a national leader who can at least mediate this to people in Luzon and help them to understand that much of the poverty that we have here in Mindanao is because of the policy that was made in Manila. Even if you look at the statistics relative to poverty in the Philippines today, I think you have like, 70 percent poor in the Metro Manila area. In the Visayas, it becomes 30 percent. In Mindanao, it becomes 40 percent. But in Muslim Mindanao it becomes 60 percent. So the development has really begun to solve the problems well in Metro Manila, it it has really neglected Muslim Mindanao and Mindanao in general. But at the same time, Mindanaoans are aware that the resources in Mindanao have been exploited by people who eventually are in Manila. The timber resources have been depleted. And now that the timber is gone, they\u2019re going after the mineral resources, you know. With no clear understanding of, if this exploitation takes place, how will Mindanao benefit? So there\u2019s a social justice dimension, a very clear social justice issue here, where we\u2019re going to have to look at the economy, how the economy has been run by the north, to the disadvantage of Mindanaoans and how politics has been played against the Mindanaoans, and even the use of the military and the perception of many Mindanaoans is that the military defends the interests of the north, rather than the interests of all. So, Mindanaoans are happy that they have now a president who loves Mindanao so much he doesn\u2019t even want to go there. He wants to govern from here, which is an endearing sign for the Mindanaoans.\nNery\n: Father, you have also been president of Ateneo de Naga, and you taught many years in Ateneo de Manila, so you know what the sentiment is in Luzon.&nbsp; In what way is President Duterte not merely the first president from Mindanao, but truly, in fact, the 16th president of the Philippines, I mean to say, what, we can now understand what the Mindanao agenda would be, but what can the voters who voted for him in Luzon, what can they look forward to from President Duterte?\nFr.\nTabora\n: Well, I think if you address the major problem of peace in Mindanao, you\u2019re not just addressing a Mindanao problem. You\u2019re addressing a national problem. This has really been a national problem with international (repercussions) for a long time. I think everybody will benefit if the problem of peace in Mindanao is addressed. I think everybody will benefit also if the problems of the indigenous peoples will also be addressed, because I think when we talk about the indigenous people, we are, to a great extent, talking about our national heritage, our national soul.\nWhere is it that we value being Filipino most? In our ability to acquire traits from the West or in our ability to be able to respect our traditions that are of old, and that form part of the richness of our Filipino heritage? The indigenous peoples, they are being decimated by what we consider to be development aggression. People want to put up a mine, and they hit the indigenous people. People want to put up a huge monocrop farm, they hit the indigenous peoples. And by hitting these indigenous peoples, they don\u2019t just displace, they destroy cultures that belong to the national heritage. I think if president Duterte can address that, he would be addressing a national thing. If because of Duterte now people in universities and people who write histories and anthropologies can correct the writing of history relevant to Mindanao that would be a big gain for the country.\nI think solving crime is a national concern, specially the drugs that affect interestingly enough, even and especially the poor. They are plagued by this problem. They are the ones affected and are being hit by this thing. And the drugs situation is very difficult because it\u2019s underground and international. It begins with drugs and it ends with human trafficking and gun-running. So a president who is going to effectively move against this kind of crime, I think is national gain. So I think if he attacks poverty that is a national gain. I think, if you were to ask me this would be my opinion. Why is it that the Liberal Party lost so badly? You know, I think it was because they ran under the slogan \u201cLet\u2019s continue with this Daang Matuwid.\u201d And people were saying \u201cContinue with that, that has not benefited us?\u201d From the viewpoint of the poor, the poor have heard of the improvement in the national economy. People are boasting how much, under the Aquino administration, the economy has grown, but they\u2019re not feeling its effects. Well, people, as far as poverty is concerned, they don\u2019t feel its effects. As far as the environment is concerned, once again, there was disappointment relative to mining. And as far as the peace process is concerned, it didn\u2019t work, so why give me a continuation of this?\nKristine\nSabillo\n,\nINQUIRER.net\nChief of Reporters\n: Father Tabora, you mentioned a while ago that \u201cDuterte is ours,\u201d meaning of Mindanao, but not ours. You also mentioned that in your much talked about speech \u201cThe President and the King.\u201d Everybody knows that no one can control Duterte. He has his own way of doing things. So how are we sure that he\u2019s grounded enough to make the right decisions for the country? I mean, besides coming from Mindanao, what do you think is in his character that would make him grounded and a good president for this country?\nFr.\nTabora\n: Many times, the comparison very badly has been made between Duterte and Trump because of the many similarities. Both of them speak their minds, both of them use expletives that are very colorful, and both of them are in a sense, icons that last, they are not afraid to strike at the idols of our civilization, our current civilization. But I think Trump is full of himself, and that\u2019s not Duterte. I think Duterte is a person who is really concerned about the poor, and really concerned about reforms, understands what he wants to do, and is going to do what he says that he\u2019s going to do, or what he means that he\u2019s going to do. So my confidence in him is the experience we had with him in Davao. This is a good man. He has a lot of, he has a colorful way of presenting himself, but business is thriving in Davao. People are happy in Davao.\nHe\u2019s not a dictator. If he were a dictator, he would be able to keep his children more in line. But you know, he has a political line, Sara has a political line, Paolo has a political line, and he allows it. You know, he says one thing and they do another thing. And he allows it. So, I think to answer your question, on the our basis of our experience here in Davao, where he has delivered well, I am confident that he would deliver well in the national scale. Duterte is also a man who does not like to have the headlines. I don\u2019t know him to be that way in Davao. He works very quietly, very effectively, you know, And when there are problems, he comes. He fixes the problems. I remember once, we had a food poisoning incident here, and a good number of our students, including myself, ended up in the hospital. And uh, lo and behold, he was at my side. And he was on the side of the kids, taking care. So people know him for that, for that sort of personal care for people who are sick, who are disadvantaged.\nSabillo\n: Sir, they say that much of the controversies surrounding Duterte now with the national media is because he is misinterpreted, or the people are not yet used to how he does things or how he says things. Do you think that the national media and the rest of the population would be able to eventually understand him more, in the long run, and adjust to how he is, how he works?\nFr.\nTabora\n: Sure, because the national media is also intelligent.&nbsp; I think the logic is, it\u2019s like learning a new language, you know. You\u2019re gonna have to learn how to decipher, we\u2019re all gonna have to learn how to decipher. I\u2019m also taken aback by all the things I hear. When I watched the Miting de Avance, I was also turned off by the rhetoric that he was using, you know. But it was rhetoric. And that\u2019s why I do hope that he will metamorphose, like what he said, \u201cI\u2019m going to be different when I become president.\u201d I do hope that he continues in his activity to bring reconciliation to the country and unity to the country. So I think it\u2019s not good to push him against the wall, you know. Let him be. Let him act, as I think he will. And I think we\u2019ll see surprising results.\nNery\n: Father, speaking of learning a new language, maybe you can help us make sense of what may be just seeming contradictions in the Duterte approach to policy and governance. I know that you\u2019ve insisted that you are not limited to the way the mind thinks, you are not part of the inner circle, you don\u2019t consider yourself an expert, but you run one of the leading educational institutions in Mindanao, that plays a key role in the Davao society. Maybe we can ask you to help us make sense of the following. Maybe I can start with the reputation which you have just reconfirmed, for reaching out to the poor. He has a lot of pro-poor policies in play, and yet he is also perhaps more famously known for insisting on the death penalty, which the Catholic Church recognizes as essentially anti-poor because of flawed judicial systems. How do you reconcile these two? So, a pro-poor approach, and yet, insistence on a policy that will, in fact, impact on the lives of the poor.\nFr.\nTabora\n: Yes, it is a seeming contradiction, and I don\u2019t know that it can be reconciled. I think president Duterte really wants to go after crime. He wants people to respect the law. As of now, he is convinced that getting people to respect the law can be done by death penalty, by the legislation of the death penalty. The Church has over and over again insisted that the death penalty is not the answer. I think the Church and a Catholic university like this will try to convince him that it is not the answer. But we will also understand that he will not decide this issue alone, he will go to Congress and Congress will decide on the basis of the Congress\u2019 perception on the common good. The Church, I think, will make a stance, say, in so many cases the death penalty is anti-poor because it kills not the rich, but the poor. And sometimes, erroneously because many times, they cannot get legal assistance. But he will say, \u2018I need some way of making people fear the law\u2019. So he\u2019ll go to Congress for that.\nNery:\nDavao has been booming for decades, as you said earlier business is thriving, and anyone can see that. Now he\u2019s bringing in some of his friends from the national democratic front, or maybe in fact from the communist party, which might spur some apprehension on the part of businessmen even businessmen in Davao City. So he\u2019s going to have a cabinet that will have at least three departments headed by people you might call our friend from the militant Left.\nHow do we understand that situation? Would we expect as in the first Corazon Aquino cabinet some internal struggles between let\u2019s say businessmen who are there and then members of the left or should we expect something else from President Duterte.\nFr.\nTabora\n:\nI don\u2019t know. It\u2019s a little bit too early. Within this week we will have a meeting \u2026in order to be able to discuss. We really don\u2019t know what this means. I\u2019m just sympathetic to the national leader, who is saying this conflict has gone for too long. And, sometimes we don\u2019t even know what is being fought about or what is being fought over. From my classes you know the Marxist movement, the communist movement relative to capitalism at heart is a social justice movement. Whether it works or not is another thing, but at heart it\u2019s a movement that is trying to call forth optimum realizations of humanity within the productions scheme that we have versus a capitalism that has so often been dehumanizing in its exclusion of many from its benefits.\nOur constitution, the way our 1987 constitution is framed, is really a social justice constitution. Sometimes I think it hasn\u2019t been tried. They already want to change it but it hasn\u2019t been tried. It\u2019s a social justice constitution, and it\u2019s trying to&nbsp; bring justice to the poor person, to the farmers etcetera.\nSo based on the constitution, there is a lot of room to come into dialogue with people who have been fighting for social justice. If the fight for social justice means that we\u2019re going to have to talk to the lords of big business, to the policy makers, to the landlords, to those who are determining land distribution, etc. We\u2019re going to have to talk because peace will depend on it.\nI don\u2019t think the CPP-NDF is just going to say now that Duterte\u2019s here we\u2019re going to give up the fight. I think we have to be able to say because of so many years of struggle, there is going to have some improvements among the farmers, some improvement among laborers that has not yet been achieved.\nI don\u2019t know what\u2019s gonna happen in those negotiations. From the viewpoint of the Mindanaoans, the NPA leftist conflict has taken a life of its own that people don\u2019t understand. Those are the NPAs, the ideology, the targets are not clear, what they\u2019re fighting for is not clear. SO often it looks like they have become a set of bandits and are simply there for themselves.\nNow in a dialogue this, it\u2019s good that something like that would be clarified. What are they fighting for this time? We know what the Bangsamoro are fighting for, but in the case of the CPP-NPA, tackling the regime is so far away that it simply becomes fighting the local military or fighting the local businesses which people don\u2019t understand.\nSo we have an opportunity with dialogue, try to understand one another, and I think representatives of a social justice constitution should be able to talk to representatives of a social justice revolution.\nNery:\nThere are a lot of pro-women initiatives in the Duterte administration here in Davao City and Duterte has a lot of female supporters, and yet especially in the last few weeks, we have been witness to rather demeaning language regarding women. How do we start to make sense of this?\nFr.\nTabora\n:\nI don\u2019t want to speak for the women and where offence has been taken. We will simply have to accept that offence has been taken. I would simply counsel Rody Duterte in what he does, not what he says or how he whistles. I don\u2019t mean to say his style is the best presidential style, but that\u2019s his way of doing things. I know that in Davao the legislation that is pro-women is the best in the country and has been leading legislation in the country so there I have to say maybe wait to see what he does, rather than just take offense in how he behaves. I don\u2019t want to excuse but I would be more comfortable if he stops the whistling and tempers his language.\nBut that\u2019s not the substance of Duterte.\nNery:\nYour fellow Jesuit Archbishop Antonio Ledesma issued a pastoral letter just before the elections where among all the things he referred to the killings in Davao, supposedly by the Davao Death Squad. The contradiction I\u2019m looking at is I don\u2019t think that there is evidence to prove that these 1,200 or so killings did not happen. So, do we give credit to Duterte for this kind of, I\u2019m not sure if the word is achievement, or as Archbishop Ledesma said, do we take into task for failing to stop these 1,200 killings since 1998 I think. So I guess the contradiction has to do with the price that Davao City pays for the peace that it enjoys. How do we approach this question of the Davao Death Squad.\nFr.\nTabora\n:\nThat\u2019s a difficult question and I don\u2019t mean to diminish its import. What Archbishop Ledesma said is true. There is a problem on the Davao Death Squads here. There has been no proof that it is linked to Duterte, but it\u2019s also true that there has been no action against them.\nThe Ateneo de Davao took a survey; we do city-wide social surveys based on the methodology of the Social Weather Stations. So, we do this regularly. One of the questions we asked was \u201cDo they accept the Davao Death Squads and what is said to have been done by them.\u201d It is a matter of concern for us that the large majority said yes.\nAnother question that we asked was \u201cWhat is your perception of the legal system, does it deliver justice.\u201d And the large majority said no. They have been able to correlate the fact that there has been a failure in the justice system, with their approval of what seems to be a system that is delivering justice. Is it the best way that things should be? Certainly not. But that\u2019s the empirical reality here that people are supportive of what seems to be delivering justice or delivering peace and order.\nI know that it\u2019s very dangerous and it\u2019s subject to human rights abuse and subject to error, and people have no ability to defend themselves. But it seems that the people who are looking at this understand that.\nIt is a big price that has been paid. At the same time, the justice system, that is supposed to prevent this sort of thing seems not to be functioning. And people understand it not to be functioning.\nSabillo\n:\nYou\u2019re confident with Duterte but do you trust the people surrounding him, especially the ones he appointed to government positions because some of them are controversial&nbsp; as well or other people have concerns about their integrity or their links to cases of corruption so what can you say about that?\nFr.\nTabora\n:\nAs of now I\u2019m not making judgments on his appointees. I feel, with many of my people here, let\u2019s give him a chance. I felt that somebody else might have been a Department of Education Secretary, but he has made that choice; I respect it; I work with that person. So, let\u2019s see what comes of this.\nNery:\nYou said that the peace process might take a different shape, so you have a framework agreement on the Bangsamoro and the Comprehensive agreement on the Bangsamoro. Are you saying that perhaps it might not be the current shape of the Bangsamoro Basic Law that will be laid before congress?\nFr.\nTabora\n:\nI hope that there will be success, there will be respect for the comprehensive agreement Bangsamoro. That\u2019s a national commitment; I really hope that it will be respected. For that to be respected I think, I hope, that the Muslim community can get together and understand itself to be represented by the MILF, but we know that it\u2019s challenging because not all feel that they are represented by the MILF. So, I hope that we can work things out as is prescribed by the comprehensive agreement Bangsamoro.\nI hope that this happens before federal system of government can be legislated by a constitutional change. So, as I said, the Bangsamoro Basic Law therefore may take a different shape because Mr. Duterte may have access to more Muslim groups whom he may lead to a new agreement among themselves for the sake of the Bangsamoro. But I am hoping that it will still be within the framework of the comprehensive agreement Bangsamoro.\nNery:\nTalking about great participation by Mindanaoans in the national government, are you encouraging perhaps your professors some of your alumni, to join the Duterte administration?\nFr.\nTabora\n:\nI think he\u2019s taking a number of our alumni, but im very jealous of my people I hope he does not take my people. We will help as much as we can. We think we can help by convening people, we\u2019ve done that in the past and we will continue to do it, like the National Democratic Front and the CPP-NPA that\u2019s coming up June 8, and June 11 and 12 we\u2019ll be convening a large number of indigenous people groups to be able to contribute to the whole discussion.\nIn these discussions, people may say what they want to say and we\u2019ll just document it and goes out in the social media. Some of it becomes viral, but that\u2019s the contribution I think we can make in the process.\nNery:\nBut Father, I know that President-Elect Duterte is interested in constitutional change, would Ateneo de Davao, your law school, take the lead in maybe starting the discussion on how this change would take place? Will it be through a constitutional convention, what kind of amendments would be in play and so on?\nFr.\nTabora\n:\nWe will certainly be very active. We\u2019ve talked about this already. Whether we\u2019d be leading, I don\u2019t think that we feel that we need to be leading it. There are law schools in Ateneo de Zambaoanga, in Xavier University, Ateneo de Manila. We are organized for our advocacy among the different Ateneos now so that we can bring a collective Ateneo name to suggestions for Constitutional change. So, I think we will be very interested, first in whether we would have a constitutional change at all. That\u2019s an issue, I know that Mr. Duterte is very much for it and for federalism, but I\u2019m also instructed by Christian Monsod who was the framer of the constitution, who really believes that many of the intentions of President-elect Duterte can be achieved simply by amending a local government code. You can bring about a constellation of provinces and bring them working together and de-imperializing Manila has simply by working with the local government code. It would therefore free us from the danger of the social justice provisions of the constitutions being tampered with. That\u2019s something that president Duterte may have to consider because he is a social justice man. And the biggest friend of social justice is Article XIII of the Constitution. It sort of spells out where we want to go, and the last thing I want is for constitutional change to be done with respect to the international desires of our multinational companies who wish to force their agendas on us, and who therefore may make the social justice failures all the worse here. So, we will be interested in this and we will participate if there are social changes in the constitution that needed to be made, we would like to be able to participate, also to protect the social justice values there in the constitution.\nNery:\nFather Tabora, 2-3 weeks ago you gave him advice. A very nuance statement, but people remember \u201cDon\u2019t turn into a monster.\u201d Maybe we can end with advice from you. I mean, if you were in a position to sit down with president Duterte, maybe you\u2019re down with food poisoning and he\u2019s sitting on the side of your bed, you have a chance to tell him, \u201cIt\u2019s what, less than 3 weeks to your inauguration?\u201d What should he be doing?\nFr.\nTabora\n:\nI put this in one of my tweets, you know, and I remember how when Cory Aquino became president, you know, she came from the masses, from the people. She was the epitome of a simple person with, who represented people power in the country, a very powerful concept at that time. When she got to Malacanang, every Tom, Dick and Harry started saying, telling her, how to be presidential. So Cory Aquino became presidential. And I think she was taken away from the masses. She became presidential, you know, people began to understand, well she\u2019s really fitting into Malacanang, you know, but I think it hurt her. I think everybody\u2019s gonna try to tell Mr. Duterte how to be presidential. And my advice to him would be: just follow your heart, follow your people and remember your mother. That\u2019s all.\nREAD:&nbsp;\nDuterte told: Follow your heart, your people\nNery:\nIt would be interesting to know that his mother was a leader of the anti-Marcos struggle in Davao City, which was the reason why he was appointed Vice Mayor. Father thank you so much\nFr.\nTabora\n:\nNo, you remember that moving scene after he was elected, he cried on the grave of his mother because his mother does play a big part in his life, you know. And his highest ideals I think come to him from his mother.\nYour subscription could not be saved.

Quezon, I said in part:\nFEATURED STORIES\nNEWSINFO\nBar exam 2024: List of successful examinees\nNEWSINFO\n3 schools have highest percentage of passers among first-time bar exam takers\nNEWSINFO\nHouse panel: Ex-president Duterte center of grand criminal enterprise\n\u201cPresident Quezon\u2019s death is a great loss to the freedom-loving world. No champion of liberty fought for such a noble cause with more determination and against greater odds. His whole life was dedicated to the achievement of his people\u2019s freedom, and it is one of the sad paradoxes of fate that with forces of victory fast approaching the Philippines, he should pass away now and be deprived of seeing the culmination of his labors\u2014the freedom of his people.\u201d\nPresident Quezon was a champion of freedom in war and in peace. The plains and hills of Bataan, where the brave Filipino and American soldiers faced with heroism the overwhelming power of the Japanese invader, were also his field of action during the revolutionary days. The city of Washington where his body temporarily rests was the scene of his early appeals and peaceful efforts for Philippine freedom. It was here, almost 30 years ago, where he secured from Congress the promise of independence, which is contained in the preamble of the Jones Law. Here, again, 18 years later, he succeeded in obtaining the passage of the Tydings\u2013McDuffie Act\u2014a reenactment with some slight amendments of the Hawes\u2013Cutting Law which was rejected previously by the Philippine Legislature. Pursuant to the provisions of the Tydings\u2013McDuffie Law, which was accepted by the Filipino people, we drafted our Constitution and established the present Commonwealth of the Philippines, and elected Manuel L. Quezon as first president.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nWhen the war came and it became necessary to evacuate Manila, President Quezon, frail and sick as he was, moved with his Cabinet to Corregidor where he shared with the soldiers the rigors of the tunnel life and from there braved the hazards of a perilous journey to the Visayas, Mindanao, Australia, and America, in order to continue the fight for the freedom of his people. Here, in Washington, with his War Cabinet, he functioned as the legitimate government of the Filipino people and served as the symbol of their redemption.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nIt was largely through his untiring efforts that the Philippines was made a member of the United Nations and accorded a seat in the Pacific War Council. It was through his initiative that negotiations were held, resulting in the introduction of Senate Joint Resolutions 93 and 94. By the terms of Senate Joint Resolution 93, the advancement of the date of the independence prior to July 4, 1946, was authorized and the pledge given to the Filipino people by President Roosevelt in 1941\u2014that Philippine independence will not only be established but also protected\u2014was sanctioned by Congress. His efforts to secure the rehabilitation of the Philippines from the ravages of war resulted in the enactment of Congress of Senate Joint Resolution 94, which provides for the physical and economic rehabilitation of the Philippines. Even before Congress definitely acted on this resolution, he had already created the Postwar Planning Board, entrusting it, together with his Cabinet, with the task of making studies and submitting recommendations looking toward the formulation of a comprehensive rehabilitation program for the Philippines.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nIn the last few moments before his martyrdom, the great Rizal lamented that he would not be able to see the dawn of freedom break over his beloved country, but he prophesied that his countrymen would see that day. \u201cI have sown the seeds,\u201d he said, \u201cothers are left to reap.\u201d Quezon, more fortunate than Rizal, died with the comforting thought that the freedom of the Philippines was already an incontestable reality, awaiting only the certain defeat of the enemy for its full expression.\nThe immediate duty, then, of those of us who, under the mandate of the Constitution and the laws of the Philippines, are charged with the mission of continuing President Quezon\u2019s work, is to follow the course he has laid, to maintain and strengthen our partnership with America, and to march forward with the United Nations with unwavering faith and resolute determination until complete victory is won.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThe tide of the war which rose high against us in the early stages of the struggle has turned in our favor. The forces of victory are on the march everywhere\u2014in Europe, in India, and China, and in the Pacific Normandy and Britanny have been occupied by the Anglo-American forces. Poland is half reconquered by our Great Russian ally. Two-thirds of the Italian peninsula are in our hands, while thousands and thousands of planes continue to batter and destroy German communication and production centers, bringing the war to the German homeland.\nIn the Pacific, the progress of the war has been equally impressive. Most of the Japanese strongholds in the Bismarck Archipelago, in New Guinea, in the Gilberts, and in the Marshalls, have fallen. The Japanese bastion of Saipan is in Allied hands; so is Tinian. The reconquest of Guam is almost completed. B-29s, the American super fortresses, are already penetrating the Japanese inner defenses, causing destruction in the enemy\u2019s vital centers of production. Gen. MacArthur\u2019s forces are hammering the enemy\u2019s outposts only 250 miles from the Philippines; while the United States Navy, maintaining mastery in the Central Pacific, is relentlessly attacking Palau, Yap, Ponape, and the Bonin Islands, in its steady advance toward the Philippines, China, and Japan.\nThe immediate duty, then, of those of us who, under the mandate of the Constitution and the laws of the Philippines, are charged with the mission of continuing President Quezon\u2019s work, is to follow the course he has laid, to maintain and strengthen our partnership with America, and to march forward with the United Nations with unwavering faith and resolute determination until complete victory is won.\nThe size and strength of the Allied landings in Europe, supported by thousands of planes and using thousands of ships, surpasses the immigration. It is no wonder that before them, the most formidable defenses of the enemy are crumbling. I believe that when our D-Day comes, the same pattern will be followed, and the mighty Allied forces will join our brave loyal countrymen in an epic victory.\nBut the forces of freedom will not land in the Philippines with guns and tanks alone. They will also bring with them food, medical supplies, and clothing which are so much needed by our suffering people. Thirty million pesos has already been set aside for the requisition of these supplies which will be sent to the front as soon as possible for distribution to our civilian population. As the war progresses and as more troops are landed in the Philippines, increasing quantities of these supplies will be made available. Philippine relief will be prompt and adequate.\nAs Philippine territory is wrested from the enemy, civil government will promptly follow military occupation so that the orderly processes of self-government may be established under the Constitution. Red Cross units, both Filipino and American, will follow the armies of freedom to help alleviate the suffering of the people. Hospitals, health, and puericulture centers will be reestablished. All schools in operation before the war will be reopened in order to resume an education of patriotism, democracy, and humanitarianism.\nThe veterans of our wars for independence, and all those who supported our struggle for freedom, will receive for their labors and sacrifices the full recognition expected of a grateful nation. War widows and orphans will be provided for. Ample compensation will be made for the destruction of public and private properties. Roads and bridges destroyed by the enemy will be rebuilt. Disrupted communications by land, sea, and air will be repaired and improved. Towns and cities, which either were destroyed or suffered damages because of the war will be reconstructed under a systematic and scientific town planning program. In this program, the towns of Bataan and Zambales will receive preferential attention. Bataan, the historic battleground where our brave soldiers, Americans and Filipinos, faced the enemy until death, will be made a national shrine.\nIn providing for the reconstruction of our industries and the rehabilitation of our agriculture, immediate attention will be given to factory workers and farmhands throughout the Philippines, and full and generous assistance will be given to the small farmers who, because of the war, have lost their nipa huts, their work animals, and farm implements.\nWe are making preparations to meet the manifold problems arising from the closing and insolvency of our banks, insurance, and credit institutions, the adulteration of our currency with unsound enemy issues, the impairment of the basis of taxation, and the initial difficulty of tax collection. Moreover, we are formulating a long-range economic program with a view to securing that sound economic foundation which will give our independence stability and permanence.\nIn the gigantic task of rehabilitation and reconstruction, we are assured of America\u2019s full assistance and support. The joint Filipino\u2013American Rehabilitation Commission is under the chairmanship of a staunch friend of the Filipino people, Senator Tydings of Maryland. To it is entrusted the task of studying and recommending to the United States and Philippine governments measures calculated to secure the complete physical and economic rehabilitation of the Philippines and the reestablishment as soon as possible of such commercial relations between the two countries, and will assure us a reasonable level of public and private property.\nIn the preparation and execution of the Filipino rehabilitation program, America\u2019s support and assistance are essential. But there are responsibilities which we as people must undertake ourselves, and which can be assumed only if we are faithful to our ideals, principles, and commitments.\nWe are a Christian people and the faith that we imbibed sprang from our contacts with nations of Occidental civilization. We embraced Christianity a century before the Pilgrim Fathers landed at Plymouth. For more than 400 years we have kept that faith. We cannot now turn back and be a pagan people.\nFor centuries, we have been a law-abiding people. We believe in and practice democracy. That is the reason why Section III, Article II of our Constitution provides that we renounce war as an instrument of national policy and adopt the generally accepted principles of international law as part of the law of the nation. It is repugnant to our Christian traditions and democratic ideals to be the satellite of a conquering power or to be allied with the masters of brute force, whether in Asia, Europe, or elsewhere.\nThe mutual relationship between the American and Filipino peoples for half a century has revealed to the Filipinos the high ideals of the American nation and the good faith that has always animated the United States in its dealings with us. Out of this association have arisen mutual understanding and continuous cooperation between the two countries, resulting in great national progress for the Philippine progress that is without parallel in history. In the epic of Bataan, where the American and Filipino soldiers fought together, the enduring friendship of our two peoples was sealed.\nIn this war between a free world and a slave world, the Philippines has freely and voluntarily taken side with the defenders of liberty and democracy. In the same manner as the enemy is resorting to every means to attain his evil ends, the United Nations are exerting their utmost to achieve complete victory. Pledged in this war to the finish, we will continue doing our best to help the war effort. Every commitment made by us in this respect will be fulfilled.\nThe Filipino people, with their wisdom in peace and gallantry in war, have established their right to take place in the family of nations as a full and sovereign member. We cannot renounce this right nor its obligations and responsibilities. We shall, as a free and self-respecting nation, fulfill our duties not only to ourselves but also to the entire freedom-loving world by participating in the establishment and preservation of a just peace for the benefit of mankind.\nThe mutual relationship between the American and Filipino peoples for half a century has revealed to the Filipinos the high ideals of the American nation and the good faith that has always animated the United States in its dealings with us.\nOur path of duty is clear. It is the path of national honor, dignity, and responsibility. It was laid out for us by the great heroes of our race\u2014Rizal, Bonifacio, and Quezon. We shall move forward steadily to reach our goal, maintaining our faith in the United States and fully cooperating with her.\nYour subscription could not be saved.

The exchange is commonly referred to in Mexico as the Nao de China, as most products traded\u2014porcelain, ivory, silk, among other goods\u2014were from Chinese merchants.\nAs it is described at the exhibit hall, the galleon\u2019s return voyage from Manila to Mexico, then called New Spain, \u201cwas a naval and cultural feat that linked the civilizations of the Asia-Pacific and the New World, and turned Spain into a global power that dominated territories on diverse continents.\u201d\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThe trade is largely credited for bringing the baroque aesthetic\u2014the extravagant, intricate style of European art, architecture, literature and music deeply influenced by the Catholic Church\u2014across the seas, lending to its evolution.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\n\u201cThe Return Voyage turned Mexico into a bridge linking many countries.

The temporary exhibit will be on display until the middle of the year.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\n\u201cThis just shows the mutual recognition of each others\u2019 relations. Our cultural ties is now going to the surface because of this special exhibition dedicated to us,\u201d said former Sen. Edgardo Angara, who visited the museum on May 14.\n\u201cIt shows the influence that each one lent to the other, Mexican influence on the Filipinos, and the Filipino\u2019s influence on them,\u201d he said.\nThe baroque museum is of special interest to Angara, as he is at the head of a private sector initiative to build the Manila-Acapulco Galleon Museum, a first-of-its-kind international museum in Manila.\n\u201cThat (exhibit) brings us to the baroque orbit,\u201d he said in an interview, describing that period in history as a \u201creaction to the perfection of Renaissance.\u201d&nbsp; Baroque derives from the Portuguese word \u201cbarroco,\u201d which means \u201cimperfect pearl.\u201d\nGalleon replica\nThe exhibit, which welcomes visitors at the ground floor of the flowing two-story building, begins with an imposing map of the galleon trade route, with a sizeable (yet not to scale) replica of the 16th-century ship used at the time.\nThe wall to its right, just at the entrance of the exhibit, features an audiovisual display of goods traded between the seas, identifying the source of particular goods. For instance, rice and cinnamon came from the Philippines.\nAt the doorstep of the exhibit is a map of the Philippines, with its major island groups labeled: Regi\u00f3n de Luzon, Regi\u00f3n de las Bisayas, Regi\u00f3n de Mindanao. It also explains the origin of the names Manila and Philippines.\nThe exhibit features Portuguese navigator Ferdinand Magellan\u2019s three-year expedition around the world, which culminated in his landing in Cebu in 1521.\nThe display also looks back at \u201cThe Taking of Manila,\u201d explaining how navigator Miguel Lopez de Legazpi, one of the Spanish Crown\u2019s lieutenants in its oriental conquest, had seized the city from Rajah Sulayman.\nThe map of the Philippines as showcased at the Museo Internacional del Barroco in Puebla City, Mexico. &nbsp;TARRA QUISMUNDO\nNavigational tools\nAnother wall features the indigenous ships that sailed the seas at the time of the galleon trade, among them India\u2019s manch\u00e9, China\u2019s samp\u00e1n and tungul, and the Philippines\u2019 parao.\nCenturies-old maps and navigational books are also on display, along with navigational equipment, art, books, furniture and several religious items from the time of the trade.\nAmong the most notable is a 1609 print of \u201cSucesos de las Islas Filipinas (Events in the Philippine Islands)\u201d by Spanish historian Antonio de Morga, which was borrowed from Puebla\u2019s Biblioteca Palafoxiana. The book is considered a seminal piece on Spanish colonial history in the Philippines.\nTwo other books on Philippine history, both by Jesuit priest Pedro Murillo Velarde, are on display at the museum: \u201cHistoria de la Provincia de Philipinas de la Compa\u00f1ia de Jesus (The History of the Province of the Philippines of the Jesuits)\u201d printed in 1749, and the \u201cGeographica Historica de las Islas Philipinas, del Africa y de sus Islas Adyacentes (Historical Geography of the Philippine Islands, Africa and their Adjacent Islands),\u201d printed in 1752.\nAnother interesting display is how the galleon trade facilitated a linguistic exchange across the Pacific. While several words of Spanish origin remain in daily Filipino conversation, it is little known that the Tagalog word \u201cpalapa,\u201d or thatched roofing made of dried palm leaves, is used as is in Mexico.\nEven around Puebla, several posters were seen promoting palapa installation in the city.\nManila shawl\nThe exhibit also featured several pieces of centuries-old Manton de Manila (Manila shawl), among goods that crossed the Pacific during the galleon trade.\nWhile most artifacts on display were sourced from Mexican and Spanish libraries and museums, the Philippines has its own contribution to the exhibit: the images of St. Agnes and St. Luke, carved in the 18th century out of molave.\nThe Philippine-made images were loaned from San Agustin Church in Manila, as facilitated by Angara.\n\u201cInitially, they refused to lend the treasures,\u201d Angara said of the Augustinians in charge of taking care of the images.\n\u201cBut I talked to them and explained to them, \u2018Do not to be afraid about loaning these treasures because they are insured, shipped by an accredited shipping company, and if you want, you can accompany your collection.\u2019 Then they understood,\u201d Angara said.\nHe emphasized the importance of Puebla City as the seat of baroque culture during the Spanish colonial era, and its undeniable similarities with the Philippines. The design of Puebla\u2019s many churches for\ninstance are strikingly parallel to that of colonial churches in the Philippines, including the wide-open plazas across the religious buildings.\nPuebla\u2019s streets are also reminiscent of the heritage city of Vigan in Ilocos Sur, albeit more colorful.\nAs renowned Mexican architect Jorge Loyzaga put it, the Philippines\u2019 influence on Mexican culture is undeniable, even while Mexicans may not realize it.\n\u201cIn all time, all places, you see the influence,\u201d said Loyzaga, a frequent traveler to the Philippines who has built his own \u201cbahay na bato\u201d with capiz windows and all in Mexico.\nAngara is looking at the MIB as an inspiration in designing exhibits for the galleon museum in Manila, slated for soft-opening in July.\n&nbsp;Impressive, interactive\n\u201cIt\u2019s very impressive. It\u2019s very interactive. That\u2019s what we want,\u201d Angara said.\nHe hopes to borrow the museum\u2019s technology in encasing the artifacts, particularly its humidity and temperature control.\nGarcia designed the installations, while the museum itself\u2014a striking white building of overlapping walls surrounded by pools of still water\u2014was designed by renowned Japanese architect Toyo Ito. The museum has drawn 185,000 visitors since it opened in February.\nAngara is working with an international ensemble of designers, engineers, architects and historians from the Philippines, Mexico and Spain to build the Manila-Acapulco Galleon Museum, currently under construction at the SM Mall of Asia Complex by the Manila Bay in Pasay City.\nThe museum will feature a historically accurate replica of a galleon used during the colonial-era trade, its design based on construction plans detailed in 18th-century manuscripts.\nRELATED STORIES\nGalleon trade coming to life in 3D\nYour subscription could not be saved.

        "content": "STONY BROOK\u2014The nuclear deal reached in July by Iran and its international interlocutors marks an obvious turning point in the Islamic Republic\u2019s relations with the outside world, particularly with the United States. But why has it taken so much longer for the United States to come to terms with Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini\u2019s revolution in Iran than it did with Mao Zedong\u2019s revolution in China?\nOf course, one explanation is the warped discourse of what George W. Bush foolishly called the \u201cglobal war on terror,\u201d in which Iran, along with Iraq and North Korea, was cast as part of an international \u201caxis of evil.\u201d\nBut the Bush administration\u2019s moralistic foreign policy merely reinforced America\u2019s stance since Iran\u2019s 1979 Islamic Revolution. And it is in the history and course of that revolution that a fuller and more compelling explanation of recent events is to be found.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nForget the French Revolution as a model: the so-called Thermidorian Reaction, when moderates ended Robespierre\u2019s Reign of Terror, was an exception to the pattern of modern revolutions. The typical pattern during our living memory is that the hardliners come after&nbsp;&nbsp; the moderates. In the Soviet Union, for example, it was the hardliners who strove to export the Marxist-Leninist revolution after World War II, condemning the world to decades of cold war.\nFEATURED STORIES\nOPINION\nUrgent action needed vs online piracy as Congress session nears end\nOPINION\nLife has shortened\nOPINION\nThe gift of second chances\nSo, too, with Iran. After Khomeini\u2019s death in 1989, the pragmatic Ali Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani became president, followed by the reform-minded Mohammad Khatami. But the hardliners struck back. Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, an obscure officer of the Basij militia, was elected mayor of Tehran in 2003 (after just 12 percent of the city\u2019s voters turned out), and then defeated Rafsanjani in 2005 to become president.\nAhmadinejad, a fanatical devotee of Khomeini, the revolution\u2019s first imam, was a reminder of the revolution\u2019s populist inception. To promote an aggressive nuclear policy was to vindicate Khomeini\u2019s battle against America, \u201cthe Great Satan.\u201d Only when Iran\u2019s voters lost patience with Ahmadinejad\u2019s incompetence and elected Hassan Rouhani in 2013 could the Islamic Revolution be said to be over.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nCould America have avoided the waste of the Ahmadinejad years? His predecessors had made serious efforts to improve relations with the United States. Encouraged by the victory of the US-led coalition in the 1991 Gulf War against Iraq (the Islamic Republic\u2019s archenemy), in 1995 Rafsanjani sent very clear signals to the United States of a willingness to restore diplomatic ties. The Clinton administration ignored Rafsanjani\u2019s effort, and the following year the US Congress unanimously passed the Iran and Libya Sanctions Act.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nAdmittedly, Bill Clinton and his advisers had plenty of reasons for skepticism. Rafsanjani was at least partly hostage to hardline opponents keen to sabotage his foreign-policy initiatives with precisely timed acts of terror in France, Germany and Argentina. But Clinton and his secretary of state, Madeleine Albright, took seriously the proposal of Khatami, Rafsanjani\u2019s successor, at the UN General Assembly in 2000 for a \u201cdialogue of civilizations\u201d to open what he called \u201ca crack in the wall of mistrust\u201d between Iran and the United States. Sadly, Iran\u2019s \u201cSupreme Leader,\u201d Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, forced his president and foreign minister to avoid the planned handshakes with their American counterparts.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nWorse was to follow. First, there was Bush\u2019s \u201caxis of evil\u201d speech in 2002. Then, in February 2005, just as the hardline Ahmadinejad was about to begin his first term as president, Bush formally rejected a nuclear deal that had been painstakingly negotiated by Rouhani (then Khamenei\u2019s representative in Iran\u2019s Supreme National Security Council) and signed, in late 2004, by France, Germany and Britain.\nAs Iran scanned the strategic horizon, it seemed obvious that the United States had invaded Iraq because Saddam did not have any weapons of mass destruction. This made Ahmadinejad\u2019s insistence on Iran\u2019s nuclear \u201crights\u201d popular with the Iranian masses and the middle class alike.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nDespite popular disenchantment with the Ahmadinejad era, that sentiment still prevails in Iran. But the nuclear accord reached last month is the product of a different political context: President Barack Obama was eager to make a deal with Iran part of his legacy and, this time, Rouhani, as president, was able to negotiate with the full backing of Khamenei, with whom (unlike Khatami) he has worked closely.\nBut there is a deeper reason for the success of the negotiations: Khomeini\u2019s Islamic Revolution of 1979 has finally ended\u2014and Khamenei knows it. He must also know that the export of Islamic revolution from Shia Iran has lost its allure, replaced in the Sunni world first by the global jihad of al-Qaida and now by the so-called Islamic State and caliphate of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.\nFor Iran, what counts now is no longer ideology but national interest and realpolitik. That is why it finds itself currently backing the opponents of revolutionary Islam: Bashar al-Assad against the Islamists in Syria and the Houthis against al-Qaida in Yemen. And it is why it finds itself not only signing a nuclear accord with the Great Satan but also tacitly cooperating with it against the Islamic State, their common enemy. Now that the revolution is over, cooperation in other areas is likely to become equally appealing.\nProject Syndicate\n&nbsp;\nYour subscription could not be saved.

PHOTOS BY CHRISTINE AVENDA\u00d1O\nQUANZHOU\u2014The sea used to be near this city, the starting point of China\u2019s ancient maritime Silk Road in the east.\nToday, Quanzhou, where the 90-meter-high Jiuri Mountain is located, is being developed into the \u201cpioneer\u201d of China\u2019s new maritime Silk Road, and Chinese officials make it clear that the Philippines is very much part of the new Chinese initiative that aims to boost trade, economic and cultural ties between the two countries and, it is hoped, strengthen political ties strained by the South China Sea dispute.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nJiuri Mountain, or \u201cHill Jiuri,\u201d as stated in the marker standing at the foot of the mountain, was a witness to centuries of prayers of Chinese and foreign sailors and travelers for good winds and smooth sailing before they set sail for foreign lands.\nFEATURED STORIES\nBUSINESS\nMore foreign brands seen coming to PH shores in 2025\nBUSINESS\nGlobal Dominion: Simplifying financing to empower every Filipino\nBUSINESS\nInternational group kicks off infrastructure investment drive for PH\nTheir prayers and wishes are forever etched in 75 inscriptions and engravings set around the hill.\nDuring the Tang Dynasty, Quanzhou was the busiest port and venue for foreign trade, and during the succeeding Song and Yuan dynasties, the largest port in eastern China.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThe inscriptions found on Jiuri Mountain say that Quanzhou was the starting point of the ancient trade route that linked the east with the west, which China is now reviving.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\n\u201cQuanzhou at that time was like Shanghai and Hong Kong today,\u201d according to Helen Chen, associate consultant of the Quanzhou Municipal Foreign Affairs and Overseas Chinese Affairs Office.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nChen said the modern Silk Road envisioned by China and other countries was intended \u201cnot only to promote trade but [also cultural and person-to-person exchanges] and even infrastructure [development].\u201d\nA Philippine delegation of journalists and academicians recently visited Fujian province to learn about the Silk Road project and understand how the Philippines could benefit from the Chinese initiative.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThe Filipinos stayed for six-days, also visiting Xiamen, and learned from Chinese officials that China wants to strengthen economic and cultural ties with the Philippines through the Silk Road initiative.\n&nbsp;\nTerritorial dispute\nThe Chinese gave an assurance of cooperation despite the territorial dispute between China and the Philippines in the South China Sea.\nInsisting it has \u201cundisputed sovereignty\u201d over almost the entire South China Sea, China seized seven Philippine-claimed reefs in the West Philippine Sea, part of the waterway within Manila\u2019s 370-kilometer exclusive economic zone (EEZ) recognized under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.\nWithout military muscle to defend its territory, the Philippines took the dispute to the UN Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague for resolution.\nChina has refused to take part in the proceedings, insisting on bilateral negotiations to settle the dispute.\nChinese academicians see the Silk Road initiative as a way for the two countries to build confidence as they try to solve the dispute through diplomacy.\nIn a meeting with the Philippine delegation, professor Xu Ke of Xiamen University\u2019s Research School of South East Asian Studies, called for confidence-building and cooperation between China and the Philippines, pointing out how the South China Sea dispute had strained ties by Manila\u2019s move to take legal action against Beijing instead of negotiating with China.\nXu also said Manila was keen about promoting a code of conduct between China and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean).\nBesides the Philippines, Asean members Malaysia, Vietnam and Brunei also have competing claims in the South China Sea.\nTaiwan also claims the whole China Sea.\n&nbsp;\nBilateral talks\nChina has for some time now been espousing bilateral talks to resolve the dispute, Xu said.\n\u201cSo first we have to build confidence between the two countries. If we don\u2019t (build) confidence to deal with the issue, so how can we do this and how can we cooperate under this scheme?\u201d he said.\nBut Xu also said the Silk Road initiative may help China and Asean countries get on politically well.\n\u201cThe problem is China and Asean have quite close economic cooperation. But in terms of the political, the gap is wider and (we can) use this scheme (Silk Road) to narrow this gap,\u201d he said.\nChinese President Xi Jinping proposed the revival of the Silk Road in 2013 with the goal of building more economic cooperation among countries in Asia, Europe and Africa.\nIn separate trips in Central and Southeast Asia in 2013, Xi spoke about the development of the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road, also called One Belt, One Road Initiative.\nOriented toward Asean\nThe 21st Century Maritime Silk Road is oriented toward Asean.\nPRAYERS FOR TRAVELERS Prayers for a safe voyage for travelers and sailors are inscribed on stones at the Jiuri Mountain inQuanzhou City. This is said to be the starting point of the ancient Maritime Silk Road in China.\n\u201cIn the 21st century, a new era marked by the theme of peace, development, cooperation and mutual benefit, it is all the more important for us to carry on the Silk Road Spirit in face of the weak recovery of the global economy, and complex international and regional situations,\u201d China\u2019s National Development and Reform Commission, Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Ministry of Commerce, said in a paper about the Silk Road.\n\u201cThis initiative advocates tolerance among civilizations, respects the paths and modes of development chosen by different countries, and supports dialogues among different civilizations on the principles of seeking common ground while shelving differences and drawing on each other\u2019s strengths, so that all countries can coexist in peace for common prosperity,\u201d the paper said.\nJiang Xiding, a professor at Xiamen University\u2019s Research School of Southeast Asian Studies, dispelled the notion that the Philippines is excluded from the Silk Road initiative because of the South China Sea dispute.\nAsia bank\nJiang said the Chinese government was not excluding the Philippines from Silk Road, pointing out that the Philippines is a member of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) that will finance infrastructure projects under the initiative.\nThe Philippines was among 21 countries, including China, that signed on in October last year as founding members of the AIIB, which was seen as a rival to the World Bank.\nAside from the Philippines and China, the AIIB founding members are Bangladesh, Brunei, Cambodia, India, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, Laos, Malaysia, Mongolia, Burman (Myanmar), Nepal, Oman, Pakistan, Uzbekistan, Qatar, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Uzbekistan and Vietnam.\n\u201cSo I think this is a good beginning for cooperation,\u201d Xing said. \u201cWhen the Philippines needs capital for construction or infrastructure, the AIIB will provide (but) certainly there will be some procedure. So I don\u2019t think the Philippines would lose from the One Belt, One Road (initiative).\u201d\nJiang said China set up a Silk Road Fund of $40 billion.

The award is considered by some as the \u201cNobel Prize for Teaching\u201d, with 1 million USD presented annually to the teacher with greatest contributions globally. In March 2015, former US President Bill Clinton handed the prize to Ms. Nancie Atwell (US). The judging panel, known as the \u201cGlobal Teacher Prize Academy\u201d, consists of head-teachers, educational experts, commentators, journalists, public officials, tech entrepreneurs, company directors and scientists from around the world. The panel includes Dr. James E. Ryan, Dean, Graduate School of Education, Harvard University; Ms. Carina Wong, Deputy Director, Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation; Ms. Lila Ibrahim, Chief Business Officer, Coursera; and Dr. Tuan Pham, Founder, Topica Edtech Group.\n\u201cThis is just the beginning of the road. The truth is that there is never any reward that will be enough to fully repay the debt we all owe to our teachers.\u201d \u2013 President Bill Clinton shared.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nMs. Nancie Atwell, the teacher honored with the Prize in 2015, founded the\nCenter for Teaching &amp; Learning\nas a demonstration school in 1990. The independent K-8 school based in Edgecomb, Maine, has gained recognition for its small class sizes, research-based curriculum and teacher training programs. The majority of her students excel in high school, and 97% matriculate to college or university. Ms. Atwell has also become known for reading-writing workshops where children have the freedom to choose what they read and can tackle as many as 40 books a year. Her 1998 book about these workshops, In The Middle, has sold more than half a million copies and has become a blueprint for other teachers across the U.S. She plans to use all of the prize money for her school. Among her top priorities are expanding the school\u2019s library system and maintaining diversity among its student body, giving tuition assistance to 80 percent of them.\nFEATURED STORIES\nGLOBALNATION\nPCG: China using AIS spoofing to mislead public and stir confusion\nGLOBALNATION\nPH asserts rights over Bajo de Masinloc at UN General Assembly\nGLOBALNATION\n'Aid for Kristine-hit Batangas': Presidential assistance for farmers, fisherfolk, families\nFormer Presidents and Prime Ministers of nearly 30 countries has issued a Pledge to Restore Teacher Respect. According to it, \u201cFrequently the ills of society are laid at the door of teachers. They are blamed for everything from a decline in manners among young people to a lack of basic skills in the workplace. They have even, on occasion, been blamed for a country\u2019s poor economic performance.\u201d\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nDr. Tuan Pham, Founder of Topica Edtech Group, and member of the Academy of Global Teacher Prize, shared: \u201cThis Prize aims to honor the great contributions of Teachers, so that children around the world will dream of becoming great teachers themselves. Teachers are providing inspiration and knowledge for the young generation to tackle the world\u2019s problems: climate change, diseases and poverty. They are also sparking creativity, and encouraging people to move forward, and therefore advancing human civilization\u201d.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThis meaningful and honorable global prize is still less known in South East Asia, so many teachers with great contributions may be in a disadvantage of not being nominated and honored. Therefore Topica\u2019s founder was invited to the judging panel as a Young Global Leader honored by the World Economic Forum, and representing an organization with strong contributions to education in the Philippines, Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam. The organizers are expecting that Topica will help promote the Prize widely in the region, finding and encouraging many nominations for great teachers in each country.

Greetings to you, Cardinal Rufino Santos, Archbishops of this Church of Manila, host to this extraordinary assembly. To each of you, brothers, Our greeting of faith and love. For your Churches, your countries, Our good wishes full of respect, friendship and peace.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nHere we are together at last. This meeting makes Us very happy. It is something new, but it corresponds to the profound nature of the Church. The Church has always been the same; it is the family of those who believe in Christ, \u00abcomposed of every nation under heaven\u00bb (Act. 2: 5). The scene at Pentecost comes to mind and from our hearts there arises and finds expression on our lips the invocation to the Holy Spirit: \u00abVeni Sancte Spiritus\u00bb. To savor this moment with you, a moment that seems to Us historic and full of mystery, We have made the long journey from Rome to Manila. We have come to meet you, dear brothers, to know you better, to pay honor to this assembly of yours, to encourage your work, to sustain your resolves. You are the reason for Our presence here today and at this moment the subject of Our words. On this Our visit to your vast continent, you are, moreover, the prime object of Our love.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nEven more worthy of Our immediate attention than the novelty and singularity of this meeting are, it seems to Us, the theological meaning that it manifests and the mystery that it makes present: Christ is here.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nHe is here through the reality, ever repeated: a gathering in his name (Matth. 18: 20). He is here through the faith that makes him live in each one of us (Eph. 3: 17). He is here also through the coming of Our humble person, to whom, as a lowly successor of Peter, is applied in a very special way the title of Vicar of Christ. And Christ our Lord is here through the apostolic ministry entrusted to each of us (Cfr.\nLumen gentium\n, 21), and through the collegial relationship that joins us together (Ibid., 22). We, the successors of the Apostles and the pastors of the Church of God, are invested with the power not only of representing Christ, but also of making present on earth and in time his voice (Luc. 10: 16) and his saving action (Matth. 28: 19). Christ is here. Let us take notice of this mysterious reality, with an act of faith both conscious and strong. It is true: we firmly believe that the Lord\u2019s promise,\u00abBehold, I am with you always, to the close of the age\u00bb (Matth. 28: 20), is fulfilled now, at this moment of history, in a singular and marvelous way. Christ is with us.\nHow is this promise fulfilled at this moment? It is fulfilled in the countenance of the Church, herself the \u00absign and sacrament\u00bb of Christ (Cfr.\nLumen gentium\n, 1; De Lubac, M\u00e9itation sur l\u2019Eglise, 157 ff.). This countenance seems here to reflect with brilliant clarity the characteristic marks of the Church: one, holy, catholic and apostolic. This last mark, apostolicity, concerns us now in a particular way. Let us think about it for a moment.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nAll of us meeting here are successors of the Apostles. We have received from Christ himself the mandate, the power, his Spirit to carry on and to spread his mission. We are the heirs of the Apostles; we are Christ working in history and the world; we are the ministers of his pastoral government of the Church; we are the institutional organ, entrusted with dispensing the mysteries of God (Cfr. 1 Cor. 4 : 1; 2 Cor. 6: 4;\nLumen gentium\n, 20).\nYou know that the Council has clearly proclaimed this doctrine, which forms part of the divine and unchanging constitution of the Church. You know too that there have sprung up many discussions about this doctrine; not all of them are useful for confirming and expounding it, as they should, but sometimes indeed more apt to confuse the doctrine and weaken it. This seems to us a suitable occasion for restating our firm support of the doctrine of the apostolic nature of the Church. We must realize that this doctrine establishes the permanence and the authenticity of the foundation of the Church by Christ; it marks the boundaries of ecclesial communion (Cfr. Luc. 10: 16; 11: 23;\nUnitatis redintegratio\n, 2); it qualifies our persons with a sacramental character for the ministry that is entrusted to us; it makes us members of a single Apostolic College, under the leadership of Peter, establishing between us bonds of unity, love, peace, solidarity and collaboration; it vindicates the importance and the fidelity of tradition. Besides this it demonstrates the present vitality and ever-renewed youth of the Church; it explains its organic hierarchy and the vital capacity of the Mystical Body to function; it safeguards the existence and the exercise of the ministerial powers proper to the Christian priesthood, which shares in the single priesthood of Christ; it is the prime source, authorized and responsible, of missionary activity (Cfr. Journet, L\u2019Eglise du Verbe Incarn\u00e9 II, 1208, 2). The fact that it derives its authority not from \u00abbelow\u00bb but from Christ does not mean that it sets up a privileged caste, but rather it makes of the Episcopate an organ for the benefit and service of all the individual churches, and of the entire Catholic Church, one which works from love, to the very point of sacrifice (Cfr.\nChristus Dominus\n, 6).\nWe remind you of all this, brothers, that your confidence may be great in Christ\u2019s assistance for you and your labors, for your sufferings and your hopes. You must be aware of your vocation, the fact of your having been chosen and of your responsibility. You must ever hear re-echoing in the depths of your souls the words of Saint Paul: \u00abBe on your guard for yourselves and for all the flock of which the Holy Spirit has made you the overseers, to feed the Church of God which he bought with his own blood\u00bb (Act. 20: 28). Be strong, be patient. You have before you an immense field for your apostolate; its very geographical vastness and the enormous multitudes that inhabit it would suffice to fire your apostolic zeal.\nHere we should cast our glance over that human panorama in which your ministry must be exercised, although we know that you have already had experience in theory and in practice.\nYou have before you an immense field for your apostolate. It is difficult to speak of Asia as a whole since more than half of mankind lives here. One can however point to a certain network of common interests, a certain identity in the way of looking at life and a certain harmony of aspirations. Young in its peoples but rich in civilizations often thousands of years old, Asia is impelled as by an irresistible desire to occupy her rightful place in the world, and her influence is effectively increasing. The attraction to change and the desire for progress are present everywhere, and Me see in them a fresh chance for the man of today.\nIt is certainly true that-except for certain regions such as the Philippines \u2013 the Church, in spite of a histoly which is already long, is represented in Asia only by small minorities. Yet who can say how much heroic devotion, as well as faith in the men of Asia, has guided from the first beginnings the destiny of the missions of this continent? Who could ever fully describe the journeyings \u2013 often, even up to our own times, painful and tragic \u2013 of a missionary apostolate upheld by only one support, that coming from on high! Therefore Our hope is great, based as it is upon the command of the Lord to go to all nations, and upon his promises conveyed in the parables of the mustard seed and the leaven in the dough (Luc. 13: 18-20). We shall limit Out-self to indicating a few points which seem to Us to be of capital importance for your present mission. Nothing of what We say is new to you; but We hope that you will take comfort in hearing your thoughts and intentions confirmed by Our words.\nThe first thing that We would propose to you is this: let us make an effort to take as our guide the teaching of the recent Ecumenical Council. This teaching sums up and ratifies the heritage of Catholic tradition and opens the way for a renewal of the Church according to the needs and possibilities of modern times. This adherence to the teachings of the Council can establish a wonderful harmony throughout the Church, and this harmony can enhance the effectiveness of our pastoral activity and preserve us from the errors and weaknesses of the present time. This is especially true in one particular field, the field of faith. It seems to Us that the defence and the spreading of the faith must take first place in our spiritual expression, and that it must be the prime object of our pastoral care. We bishops are the teachers of the faith. We are the preachers, the promoters of instruction in the faith. This is our main task and commitment. From this duty flows everything that we do to encourage study of the faith, catechesis, knowledge and meditation of the Word of God, Catholic teaching and Catholic schools, our press, the use of social communications and ecumenical dialogue. We cannot keep silent. We must not lose the truth and unity of the faith. We must strive to make the faith the fundamental driving principle of the Christian life of our communities.\nTo this plea for the affirmation and the orthodoxy of the faith permit Us to add a plea for prayer. In our day we are witnessing the decline of prayer, and you know the causes of this. Yet in favour of prayer we have two great \u2013 though different \u2013 resources: the first is the liturgical reform promoted by the recent Council. The Council has not only renewed the outward form of ritual, always according to certain traditional norms, but it has also given fresh life to the sources-doctrinal, sacramental, communal and pastoral \u2013 of the Church\u2019s prayer. We must take advantage of this providential teaching, if we wish prayer always to be the living and sincere expression of the faithful and always to retain in the Church a place of honor among religious values. The second resource of prayer is the natural inclination of the Asiatic spirit. We must honor and cultivate this deep and innate religious sense, which is the hallmark of the soul of the Eastern world. We must defend the spirituality proper to these peoples and ensure that their contact with materialistic modern secular civilization does not suffocate the inner aspirations of \u2018this spirituality. We are certain that the Church possesses the secret of true conversation with God; and you have the duty of opening the hearts of your people to the mysterious and true Word of God and to the intense filial expression of religious dialogue to which Christ authorized us and which the Spirit gives us the power to direct to the heavenly Father.\nIn this regard there arises another fundamental point, which concerns not only the language of prayer and religious instruction but the genius and style of evangelization which, as the Council says, must \u00abbe adapted to the particular way of thinking and acting\u00bb of the peoples to which it is directed (Cfr.\nAd gentes\n, 16-18, etc.).\nIf, in the past, an insufficient knowledge of the hidden riches of the various civilizations hindered the spread of the Gospel message and gave the Church a certain foreign aspect, it is for you to show that the salvation brought by Jesus Christ is offered to all, without distinction of condition, without any privileged link with one race, continent or civilization. Far from wishing to stifle \u00abthe seeds of good in men\u2019s hearts and minds or in their own rites and culture\u00bb, the Gospel heals, raises and perfects them for the glory of God (Cfr.\nLumen gentium\n, 17;\nAd gentes\n, 22). Just as Jesus Christ shared the condition of those who were his own, so the man of Asia can be a Catholic and remain fully Asian. As We declared a year ago in Africa, if the Church must above all be Catholic, a pluralism is legitimate and even desirable in the manner of professing one common faith in the one same Jesus Christ.\nAnd this, brothers, is also the foundation of your particular responsibility as you continue to proclaim Jesus Christ to the men of Asia. None better than an Asian can speak to an Asian. None better than he should know how to draw from the treasures of your rich cultures the elements for the building up in Asia of a Church which will be one and catholic, founded upon the Apostles and yet different in its life styles. Should We not note, to the praise of your peoples and for the strengthening of your pastoral activity, the natural disposition of the peoples of the East for this religious mystery, which seems a prophetic sign of their call to Christian revelation?\nYour individual churches would certainly lack an essential aspect of maturity if missionary vocations did not develop within them. It is for the bishops of Asia, for their priests, their religious brothers and sisters and their lay people engaged in the apostolate to be the first apostles of their Asian brothers, with the cooperation of missionaries from abroad, whose merits are so great, and whose efforts-God grant-will continue and grow, in the name of the unchangeable solidarity that is the duty of the whole Church in this sphere.\nOne of the aspects of the present adaptation of missionary activity, which We stressed in Our last Message for Mission Sunday, is the importance it accords to the action of development. Is not the Gospel, which is the good news preached to the poor (Luc. 4: 18), the source of development? The Church, conscious of human aspirations towards dignity and well-being, pained by the unjust inequalities which still exist and often become more acute between nations and within nations, while respecting the competence of States, must offer her assistance for promoting \u00aba fuller humanism\u00bb, that is to say \u00abthe full development of the whole man and of every man\u00bb (\nPopulorum progressio\n. 42). It is a logical consequence of our Christian faith. The hierarchy of the Philippines recalled it quite recently: \u00abChristianity and democracy have one basic principle in common: the respect for the dignity and value of the human person, the respect of those means which man requires to make himself fully human\u00bb(9th July 1970). It is in the name of this principle that the Church must support as best she can the struggle against ignorance, hunger, disease and social insecurity. Taking her place in the vanguard of social action, she must bend all her efforts to support, encourage and push forward initiatives working for the full promotion of man. Since she is the witness of human conscience and of divine love for men, she must take up the defence of the poor and the weak against every form of social injustice.\nWe know that much has been done by you in this regard, on the level both of study and action. We are convinced that in this way you are contributing to the maintaining of peace: \u00abChristian faith, as well as the intimate link that should exist between the promotion of human rights and the socio-economic progress of man are the true basis for authentic and lasting peace\u00bb, as the Philippine episcopate likewise declared (1st May 1970).\nAs We utter that word \u00abpeace\u00bb how can We fail to raise up anew our heart to implore from the Lord that the peoples so painfully and for so long afflicted by war be able at last, in justice and in peace, to lead a happy and peaceful life!\nFinally, We pray to Christ that he will grant that this journey may be for all the peoples of Asia a confirmation of the invitation offered them by him to accept his message, charged with truth and love, divinely conceived for them, for each of them, in his own language and in harmony with his own civilization, as it has been received and as it continues to be welcomed still by the people of the Philippines!\nMay Mary, Mother of the Word made flesh, Mother of the Apostles, preside still over this Pentecost.\nYour subscription could not be saved.

        "content": "\u201cAsia\u2019s Cauldron\u201d By Robert D. Kaplan, Random House, 2014\nNowadays, when we talk about the South China Sea, the conversation quickly moves to China\u2019s overbearing posture about its claims over some islands dotting this huge body of water.\nThe South China Sea is considered the throat of the Western Pacific and Indian Oceans\u2014the mass of connective economic tissue where global sea routes coalesce.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\n\u201cMore than half of the world\u2019s annual merchant tonnage passes through these choke points, and a third of all maritime traffic worldwide.\u201d\nFEATURED STORIES\nBUSINESS\nMore foreign brands seen coming to PH shores in 2025\nBUSINESS\nGlobal Dominion: Simplifying financing to empower every Filipino\nBUSINESS\nInternational group kicks off infrastructure investment drive for PH\nThe oil producing and consuming countries depend too on this sea. \u201cRoughly, two thirds of South Korea\u2019s energy supplies, 60 percent of Japan\u2019s and Taiwan\u2019s energy supplies, nearly 80 percent of China\u2019s crude oil imports come through the South China Sea.\u201d\nThe oil transported through the Malacca Strait from the Indian Ocean, en route to East Asia through the South China Sea, is triple the amount that passes through the Suez Canal and fifteen times the amount that transits the Panama Canal.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThe above insights are culled from a newly published book, \u201cAsia\u2019s Cauldron,\u201d which is sub-titled \u201cThe South China Sea and the End of a Stable Pacific\u201d\u2014authored by Robert D. Kaplan, chief geopolitical analyst for Stratfor, a private global intelligence firm. Kaplan was named by Foreign Policy magazine&nbsp; one of the world\u2019s Top 100 Global thinkers.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThis book is a timely executive read, following the signing of the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) by both the Philippines and the United States.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nA stronger defense of Philippine seas and shorelines has been on top of the Philippines\u2019 agenda considering the aggressiveness of China in pressing its claims over islands that heretofore have been considered part of Philippine territory. When the Philippine government protested the incursions of Chinese ships in these sea territories, everyone knew that the country\u2019s small boats are no match to the naval might of China.\nThe United States has somehow balanced the equation. It is a case of one bully matched by another bully. In a strategic sense, the Americans\u2019 entry into the scene is viewed, and rightly so, as the calculated moves of the American government consistent with its \u201crebalance policy\u201d in Southeast Asia.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThese contemporary events have suddenly invaded our political consciousness, and we want more information beyond official statements and releases of allies and antagonists. The South China Sea was once a peaceful sea shared by friendly neighboring nations, promising cooperative business ventures in the region and expanding sea routes for burgeoning commerce.\nKaplan\u2019s book brings us back to centuries past to explain the patterns of behavior of China and the United States. Both these continent-sized countries have been exercising hegemony casting a covetous eye on the sea territory.\nThe author observes that China is doing in East Asia today what in the past United States had done in the Caribbean!\n\u201cLike the Caribbean, punctuated as it is by small island states and enveloped by a continent-sized United States, the South China Sea is also an obvious arena for the projection of power by a continent-sized nation (referring to China).\u201d\nThe book provides answers to why China is behaving as it does today.\n\u201cThere is something deeper that propels China forward into the South China Sea and out to the First Island Chain in the Pacific: that is, China\u2019s own partial breakup by Western powers in the relatively recent past,\u201d Kaplan reveals.\nAfter all, China had been for centuries and millennia a great power and a world civilization by itself.\nThe book states that in the 19th century, as the Qing Dynasty became the sick man of East Asia, China lost much of its territory\u2014the southern tributaries of Nepal and Burma to Great Britain; Indochina to France; Taiwan and tributaries of Korea and Sakhalin to Japan; and Mongolia, Amuria and Ussuria to Russia.\nIs it a case then of China promising itself that never again&nbsp; will it allow foreigners to take advantage of its \u201cown strategic space\u201d? It really looks like China is primed, not only to protect itself from dismemberment, but to re-claim what it considers its own territories in the past wrested away from China by more powerful hegemonic empires.\nSo, what does the US, the only superpower in the world, do with these recent developments?\nKaplan does not miss a geopolitical point: \u201cWashington, for its part, will resist the moves of Beijing toward regional hegemony, even as it works with Beijing on as many issues it can.&nbsp; The South China Sea, as much as the East China Sea and the Korean Peninsula, will provide the center stage for this tense and contradictory relationship.\u201d\nAnd Washington is calibrating all its options to maintain a major presence in the South China Sea\u2014including its economic initiatives. Kaplan points out: \u201cClearly the US position in Asia will ultimately rest to a significant extent on its willingness to enter into new free trade relationships, and to join \u2018wholeheartedly\u2019 the region\u2019s multilateral and economic arrangement.\u201d\nThe book is unequivocal about this fact: \u201cEast Asia remains a main area for growth in the global economy.\u201d\nThe book has devoted each chapter to every member of the Southeast Asian club of states. He singles out Vietnam as a strong state who can be the \u201cprincipal protagonist\u201d in the South China Sea.\nHowever, Kaplan minces no words in his assessment of the Philippine\u2019s ability to counter China\u2019s offensive. \u201cThe very mismatch was poignant, the signature of China\u2019s growing might and the abject failure that was the modern Philippine state, whose lack of naval capacity was an outcome of its own social and economic failure.\u201d\nKaplan traces the persistent malaise of the Philippines to the plunder of a dictatorship\u2014and yet, mercifully so,&nbsp; has reserved positive comments on the current watch of President Aquino, coming as he does, he said, from the tandem of honest and courageous leaders in martyred Ninoy Aquino and former President Cory Aquino.\nEarly in the introduction, the book gives this historical insight: \u201cEurope is a landscape; East Asia a seascape. Therein lies a crucial difference between the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. The most contested areas of the globe in the last century lay on dry land in Europe \u2026 while the modern day theater for conflict or peace is \u201coverwhelmingly maritime.\u201d\nConsidering how geopolitics will play out among protagonists in the South China Sea, the Philippines, whose shoreline is reputedly longer than that of continental America, must independently build its defense capability.&nbsp; Meantime, it must build alliances.\nThe sea must be one that offers promise\u2014not a threat. As the book puts it in many words, such danger or opportunity depends much on how the continent-sized actors like China and the US, and how the islands play their cards.\nYour subscription could not be saved.

The mural was unveiled in July but is set to be fully completed in October, in time for the celebration of Filipino-American history month, said Silva.\n\u201cEliseo is truly a great artist,\u201d Rivera said.\nSilva in an interview with the Asian Arts Initiative said his murals inspiration comes from the depths of his heart.\n\u201cWhen I make murals, I reach down deep inside and try to find out what it is that I want to say in one sentence,\u201d Silva said.\n\u201cEven if it\u2019s the stupidest thing, it has to be that. And then it has to come out of my design, and the way I design it. It cannot be just putting together a collage of images. It has to come from something deeper within-there has to be some sort of purpose.\u201d\n\u201cIt has to be purposeful and objective,\u201d Silva added. \u201cAll of these things really for me are about trying to spark the imagination of the young people. The ones that need this the most are the young people. And if art could make them connect, or make them participate in something that is bold, dynamic and brave.\u201d\nThat is exactly the same sentiment Rivera said he wanted from Silva when the FAAPI commissioned the Corona-based artist for the mural.\n\u201cThis mural is for the future, the next generation of Filipino-Americans, so they can see where their history and where they came from,\u201d Rivera said.\nHumble beginnings\nSilva narrated to Asian Journal that started drawing at an early age. His parents operated a bakery, and while they worked he would draw on his spare time.\nHe would draw mostly portraits of his parents and other works on Manila paper, before displaying them on the bakery\u2019s walls.\nSilva said some of his first paintings were sold at the bakery. He continued his artistic venture on chalkboards in elementary school in Alabang in the Philippines.\nHe went on to earn his Bachelor of Fine Arts degree from Otis College of Art and Design, and a Masters of Fine Arts at the Maryland Institute College of Art.\nTo Silva, creating murals is the best form of storytelling. He\u2019s completed more than a hundred in his life.\n\u201cThat\u2019s what Diego Rivera did when he painted murals,\u201d Silva said to Asian Journal. \u201cHe brought the Aztec civilization and their kingdom back to life. It is a strong visual and cultural foundation.\u201d\nSilva doesn\u2019t have the same stature as Rivera but he aims to do the same thing the Mexican painter but this for the Filipino-American community.\nBringing history to the street\n\u201cThere are not a lot of Filipino artists painting murals,\u201d Silva said. \u201cTo make history you have to bring it to the streets and find a way to connect to the neighborhoods.\u201d\nSilva recalls when he created the mural in Historic Filipinotown in 1995. He said there were some members of the Filipino community who criticized him for including farm-worker activists, Philip Vera Cruz and Larry Itliong.\n\u201cBack then nobody knew who they were,\u201d Silva said, adding that most people only remember Cesar Chavez during that time.\n\u201cBut now everyone knows who Vera Cruz and Itliong are. We have to control our history. For too long, we\u2019ve had others determine what our history was. We have to take control of it.\u201d\nSilva advises other young Filipinos thinking about pursuing a career in arts to \u201cread and not just look at one perspective.\u201d\nYour subscription could not be saved.

        "content": "FILE PHOTO: A Philippine offshore gaming operator (Pogo) hub operating behind the town hall of Bamban in Tarlac province has been shut down following a government raid in March 2024 due to human trafficking, online scams, and other illegal activities. INQUIRER/RICHARD A. REYES\nThe President\u2019s decision to ban Philippine offshore gaming operators (Pogos) has presented new challenges for the government, particularly the legal gaps related to managing assets such as buildings and lands confiscated from alleged criminal operations linked to these hubs.\nOver the past months, lawmakers and officials have proposed various uses for the idle properties, including converting them into evacuation centers, schools, or government offices.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nHowever, Justice Undersecretary Nicholas Ty, head of the Inter-Agency Council Against Trafficking (Iacat) established by law in 2012, highlighted one of the many concerns they faced: the need for immediate access to the resources seized from suspected scam hubs to support trafficking victims and Pogo employees rescued during raids.\nFEATURED STORIES\nGLOBALNATION\nPH asserts rights over Bajo de Masinloc at UN General Assembly\nGLOBALNATION\nPCG: China using AIS spoofing to mislead public and stir confusion\nGLOBALNATION\n'Aid for Kristine-hit Batangas': Presidential assistance for farmers, fisherfolk, families\n\u201c[There is] an absence of a clear provision that expressly empowers [the] state [to] provisionally use assets pending forfeiture, especially money that can be used to maintain victims and facilities,\u201d Ty told the Inquirer on Thursday.\nREAD:\nAuthorities raid Pogo hub in Bataan BPO company\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nAlthough the Anti-Financial Account Scamming Act signed in July 2024 addresses this matter, Ty noted that Iacat was still waiting for its implementing rules and regulations.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nIn the meantime, the government found a \u201ccreative solution\u201d\u2014\u201ccommandeering\u201d raided facilities and using them to house thousands of trafficking victims, he said.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nAccording to Iacat\u2019s records, over 3,000 Pogo employees have been rescued and \u201cpresumed to be victims of human trafficking.\u201d\n\u201cWe do not really have enough shelters to house these victims of trafficking, and if we do let them out, chances are they are just gonna be re-trafficked or revictimized in another scam hub,\u201d Ty said during a forum last Tuesday organized by the Stratbase ADR Institute.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nA comprehensive inventory of the total number of buildings, floor area, land area, and estimated value has not been published by the authorities following the raids on these hubs, notably those in Bamban, Tarlac, and Porac, Pampanga.\nThere has also been no disclosure of any plan by responsible government agencies to inspect these properties to determine whether they were suitable for classrooms, offices, medical facilities, evacuation centers, or other purposes while criminal and civil forfeiture cases are pending.\nNew Marcos warning\nLess than three weeks before his year-end deadline to shut down all Pogos in the country, which he announced in his State of the Nation Address in July, President Marcos warned that those who run \u201cguerrilla\u201d or rogue Pogo and internet gaming licensees (IGLs) after he had canceled all their licenses.\nMr. Marcos formalized the ban in November under Executive Order No. 74.\n\u201cWe will never let them wreak havoc on us again. Anyone who attempts to launch illegal operations will face the full force of our laws,\u201d the President said.\nHe posted his remarks on Facebook and Instagram on Wednesday night, after meeting with Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corp. (Pagcor) chair Alejandro Tengco, Presidential Anti-Organized Crime Commission (PAOCC) chief Gilbert Cruz, Interior Secretary Juan Victor \u201cJonvic\u201d Remulla and other government officials on winding down the operations of the remaining offshore gaming hubs.\nOn Thursday morning, the President ordered law enforcement agencies to carry out small but multiple operations against offshore gaming operators that were still running their businesses despite the ban.\nHe directed local officials to coordinate with the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) in going after Pogos and IGLs in their areas and ordered the DILG to step up gathering intelligence on the presence of Pogos in communities.\nCanceled licenses\nAccording to Malaca\u00f1ang, 53,700 Pogo licenses were canceled, while 18 IGLs voluntarily canceled theirs as of Nov. 29. By Dec. 31, all licenses will be deemed canceled, and the Philippines will supposedly be \u201cPogo-free\u201d by January 2025.\nIt said 353,000 visas had been issued to foreign workers for these gaming establishments. By the end of the Duterte administration, only 33,863 remained, and 23,099 of them recently left the country.\nMany more foreigners, mostly Chinese, entered the country as tourists and found jobs as Pogo workers, according to a Senate investigation of the pastillas scam. The total number of foreign workers working legally and illegally in Pogos could far exceed the number of legitimate employment visas issued by the government.\nDuring Tuesday\u2019s forum, Ty said that since Pogo hubs were usually one-stop shops, not just the offices but actual residences of the trafficking victims, the government used the facilities to temporarily house rescued workers there.\nHe said that under the Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act, \u201cproceeds of instruments of human trafficking can be forfeited in favor of Iacat for the benefit of victims of human trafficking.\u201d\nNo typical victim\nAnother significant legal challenge is \u201cvictim identification\u201d and \u201cforced criminality\u201d because many rescued individuals refuse to see themselves as trafficking victims, Ty said.\nHe said that human trafficking, often described as modern-day slavery, differs from past enslavement where victims were treated as property.\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s why it becomes even more complex in the victimology of the trafficking victims and the scam hubs. Because they are not, at least from the Philippine perspective, the typical trafficking victim who is from a very poor location who is mired in poverty, who is not that educated,\u201d he explained.\n\u201cThe victims of human trafficking, at least from the Philippines\u2014well, even from other countries\u2014they\u2019re usually college graduates from middle-income families. They\u2019re tech-savvy,\u201d Ty added.\nHe said the authorities will use other measures, such as anticorruption laws, to prosecute \u201cother enablers\u201d of human trafficking like government officials.\n\u2018Leakage\u2019 probe\nFor its part, the Supreme Court said it found no evidence linking members of the judiciary to the alleged \u201cleakage\u201d of information regarding the Porac raid last June.\nChief Justice Alexander Gesmundo on Wednesday told reporters that preliminary inquiries \u201cdid not get positive results\u201d and that judges and court staff were involved.\nWhen authorities raided the Pogo compound in Porac, the PAOCC found only 158 Chinese, Vietnamese, and Malaysians instead of the more than 1,000 individuals who were supposedly there at the time\u2014an indication that the operators had insider information about the raid.\nSen. Sherwin Gatchalian later alleged the result of the raid showed the possible influence of Chinese syndicates in the judiciary and that when PAOCC requested a search warrant, the Pogo operators received a tip.\nYour subscription could not be saved.

But the Philippine Coast Guard suspected it was probably just a glitch.\u2014Contributed photo\nSAN ANTONIO, ZAMBALES, Philippines \u2014 Residents of San Felipe town in this province were alarmed on Tuesday after seeing in a marine tracker what appeared to be a China Coast Guard (CCG) vessel near a dredging site.\nLocals who routinely monitor vessels operating in the Sto. Tomas River were taken aback upon detecting a vessel identified as a CCG ship with body No. 21543 approaching the area, according to Elezer Requirme, a resident and beach resort owner.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\n\u201cThere are currently four dredging vessels operating in the area, hauling sand and transporting it to a reclamation site in Manila Bay,\u201d Requirme said in a phone interview.\nFEATURED STORIES\nNEWSINFO\nBar exam 2024: List of successful examinees\nNEWSINFO\n3 schools have highest percentage of passers among first-time bar exam takers\nNEWSINFO\nBar exam result 2024: 3,962 passed \u2013 Supreme Court\nHe said the vessel they saw appeared to be a CCG vessel on the tracker.\n\u201cWhen we checked again, it disappeared from the tracker, as though its AIS (automatic identification system) had been turned off,\u201d Requirme said.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nRequirme is among the residents who have been opposed to dredging operations in the province and a member of the group that monitors dredging vessels in Sto. Tomas using a marine tracker app.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nImmediate inspection\nResponding to their concerns, the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) personnel in Zambales immediately boarded all dredging vessels in the area for inspection.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nCmdr. Euphraim Jayson Diciano, chief of the PCG station in Zambales, assured residents that all vessels would be closely monitored, noting that their detection of a suspected CCG vessel may have been just due to a technical glitch.\n\u201cWe have located the vessel of concern and it is currently in Guangzhou, China. It could not have been in San Felipe because if the AIS was turned off, the marine tracker would only display its last known position,\u201d Diciano explained in a phone interview.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nUndocumented crew\nThe Zambales residents raised the matter a day after Sen. Risa Hontiveros also sounded the alarm over possible Chinese espionage using dredging operations as cover.\nIn a privilege speech on Monday, Hontiveros, the Senate deputy minority leader, cited a PCG report on the discovery of 13 undocumented Chinese nationals on the dredging vessel MV Harvest 89 in Mariveles, Bataan province, on Nov. 26.\n\u201cThe PCG personnel were shocked that during a routine predeparture inspection to secure a Masters Declaration of Safe Departure, the crew members attempted to deny them entry,\u201d she said.\n\u201cThe crew members told the PCG that their documentation was okay. Smelling a rat, our coast guards boarded the vessel where they discovered nine undocumented Chinese crew members, and when they searched deeper, they found four more, bringing the total to 13,\u201d the opposition senator added.\n\u2018PLA\u2019 uniform\nWhat\u2019s more shocking, Hontiveros said, was the discovery inside the vessel of a People\u2019s Liberation Army uniform similar to what was found in illegal Philippine offshore gaming operator (Pogo) hubs.\nShe noted that this was not the first time the PCG caught dredging vessels engaged in suspicious activities.\nIn May this year, the PCG also apprehended a vessel pretending to carry a Philippine flag when it was actually registered in Sierra Leone. Its crew members were all Chinese nationals, she said.\n\u201cThe presence of undocumented Chinese nationals aboard a vessel engaged in such contentious operations is a chilling revelation. What were they doing there? Who permitted their entry? Were they acting as laborers, or, as some fear, engaging in activities of an intelligence-gathering nature?\u201d asked Hontiveros.\n\u201cEspionage is not merely the stuff of spy novels. As we have sadly learned due to recent events, it is a clear and present danger in the modern geopolitical landscape. As Nica (National Intelligence Coordinating Agency) had said during our recently concluded Pogo hearings in which a Philippine mayor was confirmed by our intelligence apparatus to be an \u2018agent of influence,\u2019 all regions of our country have been infiltrated by agents of the Chinese Communist Party,\u201d she added.\n\u2018Nasasalisihan tayo\u2019\nHontiveros was referring to Alice Guo, the dismissed mayor of Bamban, Tarlac, who is now detained and facing charges after being linked to an online gaming hub that was raided in her town.\n\u201cWhen foreign nationals operate covertly in our territory, it compromises not only our security apparatus but also the trust of our citizens in the government\u2019s ability to protect them,\u201d she said.\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m scared of is that while we are busy with all that\u2019s happening in our country, our enemies are creeping in (nasasalisihan tayo),\u201d she added.\nIn her speech, Hontiveros said the company behind the dredging activity in Bataan was the China state-run firm China Harbour Engineer Co. (CHEC) which was earlier blacklisted by the United States for its alleged role in the militarization of the South China Sea, as well as by the World Trade Organization for alleged corrupt practices.\nEnvironmental damage\nHontiveros urged the Department of Justice, through the Bureau of Immigration, to investigate the undocumented persons aboard the vessels and review their Alien Employment Certificates issued by the Department of Labor and Employment.\nShe also asked the Department of Environment and Natural Resources to conduct an exhaustive assessment of the environmental damage caused by the dredging operations and hold responsible parties accountable.\nHontiveros said there should also be a review of all existing agreements that permit foreign entities to engage in resource extraction or related activities within Philippine waters to ensure that the agreements align not just with ecological preservation but also with national security.\nYour subscription could not be saved.

        "content": "The jubilant streets of Damascus are awash with a sense of freedom. Women perform the \u201czaghrouta,\u201d a piercing, celebratory ululation; men chant slogans; and the nation collectively breathes a sigh of relief. The fall of Bashar al-Assad and his flight to Moscow signals the end of an era of repression. Yet, amidst the celebrations, the echoes of history remind us that such moments are but the first steps in the arduous journey of transition.\nAssad\u2019s dramatic departure is reminiscent of other despots forced into exile: Ferdinand Marcos Sr. fleeing to Hawaii in 1986, laden with treasures looted from the Philippine people; Muammar Gaddafi\u2019s brutal demise in Libya; and Saddam Hussein\u2019s humiliating fall in Iraq. Each instance of a dictator\u2019s downfall has triggered euphoria, but also exposed deep challenges in the aftermath. For Syria, these challenges loom large, as the nation grapples with the legacies of autocratic rule, civil war, and external meddling.\nFor over 50 years, the Assad family ruled with an iron fist, crushing dissent and maintaining power through a maze of alliances. The civil war that erupted in 2011 triggered heightened repression, leading to decades of unimaginable suffering: hundreds of thousands dead and millions displaced.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nScenes of jubilation in Syria mirror those of the Edsa People Power Revolution in the Philippines, where citizens took to the streets to topple Marcos Sr.\u2019s regime. Just as Filipinos dismantled the vestiges of a dictator\u2019s reign\u2014smashing statues and reclaiming public spaces\u2014Syrians now seize the moment to exorcise symbols of the Assad family\u2019s domination. Yet, while the Philippines managed a relatively swift transition to democratic rule, Syria\u2019s path is far more uncertain.\nFEATURED STORIES\nOPINION\nUrgent action needed vs online piracy as Congress session nears end\nOPINION\nLife has shortened\nOPINION\nThe gift of second chances\nHistory offers cautionary tales for Syria. Libya and Iraq, both torn apart after the fall of autocratic regimes, failed to establish stable political orders. These examples highlight the dangers of power vacuums and unbridled factionalism. Syria\u2019s deeply fragmented opposition, including Islamist groups like Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and Kurdish factions under the Syrian Democratic Forces, is emblematic of these challenges. HTS, despite its pledge to embrace inclusivity, remains burdened by a controversial past with ties to al-Qaida, casting doubt on its ability to foster unity.\nThe stakes are further complicated by Syria\u2019s geopolitical significance. Regional powers such as Turkey, Iran, and Israel, alongside global actors like Russia and the United States, have entrenched themselves in the conflict. Israel\u2019s recent seizure of a buffer zone in the Golan Heights, Turkey\u2019s ongoing skirmishes with Kurdish forces, Russian interests in maintaining influence, and US preemptive strikes to deny weapons caches from remnant ISIS forces, underscore the volatile landscape. Any transition must navigate these external pressures while addressing domestic fissures.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThe nation\u2019s ethnic and sectarian divisions, exacerbated by years of war, require sensitive reconciliation efforts. The abundance of weapons among various factions raises the specter of prolonged violence, as former allies in the fight against the Assad regime may turn on one another. Syria\u2019s infrastructure lies in ruins, and its oil reserves, controlled by Kurdish forces, remain a contentious issue. International aid and investment are essential for rebuilding, but political instability and mistrust could hinder these efforts.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nDespite these challenges, there are reasons for cautious optimism. Rebel leaders have expressed commitments to pluralism and minority rights, signaling a potential departure from the Assad regime\u2019s exclusionary policies. Turkey, despite its complex role in the conflict, sees stability in Syria as a chance to repatriate millions of Syrian refugees. The international community, led by the United Nations, has pledged support for a peaceful transition. Such external engagement, coupled with lessons learned from other post-conflict transitions, could provide a framework for demilitarization, power sharing, and justice.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThe experiences of the Philippines, Libya, and Iraq serve as reminders of the perils and possibilities inherent in regime change. While the fall of Bashar al-Assad is a victory for the Syrian people, the road ahead demands wisdom, resilience, and unity.\nIn the Edsa People Power Revolution, Filipinos found strength in collective action, dismantling martial rule, and reclaiming democracy. Similarly, Syrians now have the opportunity to forge a new identity rooted in inclusivity and justice. The fall of Bashar al-Assad is an opportunity for reinvention, though fraught with risks. The lessons of history caution against complacency. Celebrations must give way to dialogue, and euphoria must be tempered by the hard work of nation-building.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\ndoyromero@gmail.com\nYour subscription could not be saved.

(AP Photo/Richard Vogel)\nEric Smalley\n,\nThe Conversation\nand\nMatt Williams\n,\nThe Conversation\nA three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit on Dec. 6, 2024,\nupheld a law\nrequiring TikTok\u2019s China-based parent company, ByteDance, to sell the\nvideo app\nby Jan. 19, 2025, or face a nationwide ban on the app. The court rebuffed TikTok\u2019s claim that the law violates its First Amendment rights.\nThe appeals court ruling is the latest development in a lengthy saga over the fate of an app that is widely popular, especially among young Americans, but that many politicians in Washington\nsay is a security risk\n.\nYour subscription could not be saved. Please try again.\nYour subscription has been successful.\nSubscribe to our daily newsletter\nSIGN ME UP\nBy providing an email address. I agree to the\nTerms of Use\nand acknowledge that I have read the\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nThe ruling is unlikely to be the end of the story. TikTok is\nexpected to appeal the case\nto the U.S. Supreme Court, though the court could refuse to hear the appeal. President-elect Donald Trump has reversed his earlier support for banning the app under its current ownership and stated during his 2024 presidential campaign that he would\n\u201csave\u201d the app\n, though he has not said how he would attempt to do so.\nBut why is TikTok controversial? Are the claims of it being a national security risk valid? And what will the case mean for free speech? The Conversation\u2019s contributors have been on hand to answer these questions.\n1. An agent of the Chinese state?\nPoliticians who want to ban TikTok, or at least sever its links to China, fear that the app provides a way for the Chinese Communist Party to influence Americans or use their data for malicious purposes. But how much influence does the Chinese government have at TikTok? That question is addressed by\nShaomin Li\n, a scholar of China\u2019s political economy and business at Old Dominion University.\nADVERTISEMENT\nLi explains that the relationship between TikTok, ByteDance and the Chinese Communist Party\nis nuanced\n\u2013 it isn\u2019t simply a matter of officials in Beijing telling ByteDance to jump and the parent company dictating how high its subsidiary will leap. Rather, as with all companies in China, employees are under certain obligations when it comes to advancing national interests. In China, private enterprises, such as ByteDance, operate as joint ventures with the state.\n\u201cRegardless of whether ByteDance has formal ties with the party, there will be the tacit understanding that the management is working for two bosses: the investors of the company and, more importantly, their political overseers that represent the party,\u201d Li writes. \u201cBut most importantly, when the interests of the two bosses conflict, the party trumps.\u201d\n2. Exploiting user data\nThe risks TikTok poses to U.S. users are similar to the risks posed by many popular apps, principally that the app collects data about you. That data, which includes contact information and website tracking, plus all data you post and messages you send through the app, is available to use or misuse by ByteDance and any other entity that has or gains access to it.\nADVERTISEMENT\nIowa State University cybersecurity researcher\nDoug Jacobson\nwrites that U.S. officials and lawmakers are concerned that the\nChinese government could exploit TikTok user data\nto spy on U.S. citizens. Government hackers could use the TikTok data to trick users into revealing more personal information.\nBut if the goal is to counter Chinese hackers, banning TikTok might prove too little, too late. \u201cBy some estimates, the Chinese government has already collected personal information on at least 80% of the U.S. population via various means,\u201d Jacobson writes. \u201cThe Chinese government \u2013 along with anyone else with money \u2013 also has access to the large market for personal data.\u201d\n3. The security risks of a ban\nBanning TikTok could also make U.S. users more vulnerable to hackers of all stripes. Rochester Institute of Technology computer security expert\nRobert Olson\nwrites that many of the more than 100 million U.S. TikTok users could try to get around a ban on the app, with\nnegative consequences for their digital safety\n.\nIf TikTok ends up banned from Apple\u2019s and Google\u2019s app stores, users could try to access the app elsewhere via sideloading. This practice of getting around Apple and Google app stores leaves users vulnerable to malware posing as the TikTok app. TikTok users might also be motivated to circumvent Apple and Google security controls in order to keep the app installed, a move that would make users\u2019 phones more vulnerable.\n\u201cI find it unlikely that a TikTok ban would be technologically enforceable,\u201d Olson writes. \u201cThis \u2026 legislation \u2013 aimed at improving cybersecurity \u2013 could motivate users to engage in riskier digital behavior.\u201d\n4. First Amendment concerns\nIn its legal challenge to the U.S. government, ByteDance claims the government is violating its First Amendment rights. Technology law scholars\nAnupam Chander\nof Georgetown University and\nGautam Hans\nof Cornell University write that\nByteDance has grounds for its claim\n, and that the implications go beyond this case.\nTikTok is a publisher, an online publisher of users\u2019 videos. Forcing ByteDance to divest TikTok is a form of prior restraint \u2013 the government preventing speech before it occurs.\n\u201cBy forcing the sale of TikTok to an entity without ties to the Chinese Communist Party, Congress\u2019 intent with the law is to change the nature of the platform,\u201d they write. \u201cThat kind of government action implicates the core concerns that the First Amendment was designed to protect against: government interference in the speech of private parties.\u201d\n5. What about the others?\nSecurity and legal issues aside, the forced sale to a U.S.-based company or ban of TikTok in the United States is a\nquestionable approach to solving the problems\nthe law aims to address: potential Chinese government influence in the U.S., harm to teens, and data privacy violations, writes Arizona State media scholar\nSarah Florini\n.\nThe Chinese government \u2013 and other U.S. adversaries \u2013 has long used social media apps owned by U.S. companies to attempt to influence American public opinion. TikTok is hardly alone in posing harm to teens, as the\nFacebook whistleblower case amply demonstrated\n. And vast amounts of Americans\u2019 personal data are already available to any buyer on the open and black markets.\n\u201cConcerns about TikTok are not unfounded, but they are also not unique. Each threat posed by TikTok has also been posed by U.S.-based social media for over a decade,\u201d Florini writes.\nThis is an updated version of an article originally published on Sept. 16, 2024.\nEric Smalley\n, Science + Technology Editor,\nThe Conversation\nand\nMatt Williams\n, Senior International Editor,\nThe Conversation\nThis article is republished from\nThe Conversation\nunder a Creative Commons license.

Associated Press\nCAPE TOWN, South Africa \u2014 President Joe Biden is finally making his long-promised visit to Africa this week, attempting to showcase a U.S.-backed railway project in three countries that he has pushed as a new approach in countering some of China\u2019s global influence.\nBiden\u2019s first visit to the continent as president \u2014 which he left to the very end \u2014 will highlight the Lobito Corridor railway redevelopment in Zambia, Congo and Angola. It aims to advance U.S. presence in a region rich in the critical minerals used in batteries for electric vehicles, electronic devices and clean energy technologies.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThat\u2019s a key field for U.S.-China competition and China has a stranglehold on Africa\u2019s critical minerals.\nFEATURED STORIES\nGLOBALNATION\nPCG: China using AIS spoofing to mislead public and stir confusion\nGLOBALNATION\nPH asserts rights over Bajo de Masinloc at UN General Assembly\nGLOBALNATION\n'Aid for Kristine-hit Batangas': Presidential assistance for farmers, fisherfolk, families\nA new strategy\nThe U.S. has for years built relations in Africa through trade, security and humanitarian aid. The 800-mile (1,300-kilometer), $2.5 billion railway upgrade is a different move and has shades of China\u2019s Belt and Road foreign infrastructure strategy that has surged ahead.\nREAD:\nBiden\u2019s promised visit to Africa shows no signs of happening yet\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThe Biden administration has called the corridor one of the president\u2019s signature initiatives.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nBiden starts a three-day trip to Angola on Monday, yet Lobito\u2019s future and any change in the way the United States engages with a continent of 1.4 billion leaning heavily toward China depends on the incoming administration of Donald Trump.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\n\u201cPresident Biden is no longer the story,\u201d said Mvemba Dizolele, the director of the Africa Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington-based think tank. \u201cEven African leaders are focused on Donald Trump.\u201d\nA fit for Trump\u2019s vision?\nThe U.S. has committed hundreds of millions of dollars to the Lobito Corridor alongside financing from the European Union, the Group of Seven leading industrialized nations, a Western-led private consortium and African banks.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\n\u201cA lot is riding on this in terms of its success and its replicability,\u201d said Tom Sheehy, a fellow at the United States Institute of Peace, a nonpartisan federal research institution.\nREAD:\nBiden fetes Kenyan leader as Africa competition grows\nHe called it one of the flagships for the G7\u2019s new Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment, which was driven by Biden and aims to reach other developing nations as a response to China\u2019s Belt and Road.\nBiden promised to visit Africa last year after reviving the U.S.-Africa Summit for the first time in nearly a decade in December 2022. The trip was kicked back to 2024 and delayed again this October because of Hurricane Milton, reinforcing a sentiment among Africans that their continent is still low priority. The last U.S. president to visit was Barack Obama in 2015.\n\u201cAfrica never gets top attention,\u201d said Witney Schniedman, an expert on African economic growth at the nonprofit Brookings Institution.\nBut many are optimistic that the Lobito project, which isn\u2019t due for completion until well after Biden has left office, will survive a change of administration and be given a chance. It goes some way to blunting China, which has bipartisan backing and is high on Trump\u2019s to-do list.\n\u201cAs long as they keep labeling Lobito one of the main anti-China tools in Africa, there is a certain likelihood that it\u2019s going to keep being funded,\u201d said Christian-G\u00e9raud Neema, who analyzes China-Africa relations.\nSome success in Africa\nThe Lobito Corridor will be an upgrade and extension of a railway line from the copper and cobalt mines of northern Zambia and southern Congo to Angola\u2019s Atlantic Ocean port of Lobito, a route west for Africa\u2019s critical minerals.\nIt\u2019s little more than a starting point for the U.S. and its partners, because China is dominant in the mining in Zambia and Congo. Congo has more than 70% of the world\u2019s cobalt, most of which is heading to China to reinforce its critical mineral supply chain that the U.S. and Europe have to rely on.\nLobito was made possible by some American diplomatic success in Angola that led to a Western consortium winning the bid for the project in 2022 ahead of Chinese competition, a surprise given Angola\u2019s long and strong ties with Beijing. China financed a previous redevelopment of the railway.\nThe Biden administration accelerated American outreach to Angola, turning around what was an antagonistic relationship three decades ago when the U.S. armed anti-government rebels in Angola\u2019s civil war. U.S.-Angola trade was $1.77 billion last year, while the U.S. has a stronger stake in regional security through a strategic presence on the Atlantic Ocean, and Angolan President Jo\u00e3o Louren\u00e7o\u2019s role mediating in a conflict in eastern Congo.\nIn Angola, Biden will announce new developments on health, agribusiness, security cooperation as well as the Lobito Corridor, White House officials said on a preview call with reporters.\nThe visit, the first by a sitting U.S. president to Angola, will \u201chighlight that remarkable evolution of the U.S.-Angola relationship,\u201d Frances Brown, a special assistant to the president and senior director for African affairs at the National Security Council, said on a separate call.\nIt will also draw attention to a perennial challenge for America\u2019s value-based diplomacy in Africa. International rights groups have used Biden\u2019s trip to criticize the Louren\u00e7o government\u2019s authoritarian shift. Political opponents have been imprisoned and allegedly tortured, while security and other laws have been passed in Angola that severely restrict freedoms, throwing some scrutiny on Washington\u2019s new African partnership.\nWill the US really show up?\nThose calling for more U.S. presence in Africa say Angola and the Lobito spinoff show what might be achieved, even with China-facing countries, if the U.S. is willing to consistently engage. But they see signs for Africa when China has held a summit with African leaders every three years since 2000, while the US has had just two summits, in 2014 and 2022, and there are no plans for the next one.\nMichelle Gavin, a former U.S. ambassador to Botswana and adviser on Africa to Obama, said that the U.S. had failed to take Africa seriously over multiple administrations, a bipartisan trend. She doesn\u2019t see Biden\u2019s visit and Lobito being a major \u201cinflection point\u201d that will drive a new U.S. focus across Africa.\nYour subscription could not be saved.

Paolo Duterte at the Batasang Pambansa building in Quezon City, the Vice President said she faced mortal danger from the Speaker of the House.\nShe said she told the House sergeant-at-arms, retired police Maj. Gen. Napoleon Taas, that she didn\u2019t need any extra security personnel as she had brought her own.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\n\u201cIf anything happens to me here inside (the House), there is only one person who wants to kill me, and that\u2019s (Speaker) Martin Romualdez,\u201d she said.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nBut she added: \u201cI don\u2019t think he will do that here inside. He will do it outside.\u201d\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nRomualdez on Thursday called out Duterte for sending her officials instead of herself to explain to lawmakers her use of P612.5 million in confidential funds of the OVP and the Department of Education when she was still the education secretary from 2022 to 2023.\n\u201cShe should now appear, take the oath, speak and explain,\u201d Romualdez told reporters in Butuan City on Thursday. \u201cShe shouldn\u2019t let her officials at the OVP and DepEd handle (the explanations).\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nShe should be the one to speak.\u201d\nOvernight stay\nAccording to House officials, Duterte made the move to place herself inside the House on Thursday night, arriving at the Batasang Pambansa in Quezon City around 7:40 p.m. supposedly to visit Lopez, who was cited for contempt and ordered detained a day earlier.\nLopez, 50, who had twice served as Davao City administrator when Duterte was the city mayor, was cited for her \u201cevasive\u201d answers to a House inquiry into the Vice President\u2019s use of confidential funds and for \u201cundue interference\u201d in the House\u2019s oversight function by telling the Commission on Audit (COA) not to hand over audit reports on the funds to the committee looking into the spending of the OVP.\nAfter detention visits ended at 10 p.m. on Thursday, Duterte refused to leave the House and locked herself inside the office of her brother, Davao Rep. Paolo Duterte, where she stayed overnight, according to Taas.\nHouse Secretary General Reginald Velasco said that Duterte and her staff remained in her brother\u2019s office and refused to leave even after they had shut down power, which the House normally does ahead of the long weekend as its offices are closed from Friday to Sunday.\nIn a statement on Friday, Senior Deputy Speaker Aurelio Gonzales Jr., Majority Leader Manuel Jose Dalipe and Deputy Speaker David Suarez denounced Duterte\u2019s brazen disrespect of the chamber and her serious breach of security.\n\u201cNo matter how many times she was asked by our House sergeant-at-arms to leave, she has ignored it,\u201d they said. \u201cIf she does not have respect for simple rules, how can we trust that she is able to respect the bigger responsibilities she must do as an elected public official?\u201d\nManila Rep. Joel Chua, who heads the House committee on good government and accountability investigating Duterte\u2019s alleged misuse of confidential funds as Vice President when she was education secretary, said at a press conference that he had denied Duterte\u2019s request to stay with Lopez inside the House detention facility.\nRequest denied\nIn a Nov. 21 letter to Chua, Vice President Duterte appealed on humanitarian grounds to stay with Lopez, expressing concern for her chief of staff\u2019s health and well-being.\nShe listed down, among others, Lopez\u2019s chronic back problems, nausea, lightheadedness, and fears for her safety.\nChua rejected her request, citing the strict rules of the Office of the Sergeant-at-Arms (Osaa) regarding detention, adding that the facility was exclusively for detainees.\nBut Duterte pressed on, stating in another letter on Friday her intent to visit Lopez daily \u201cfor the full period of her detention\u201d according to the guidelines of the Osaa pertaining to persons under House custody.\nDuring her Zoom press conference, Duterte was asked why she was evading the House probe. She replied that the House was imposing \u201cunconstitutional\u201d rules in its hearings and planned to legally challenge its investigation.\n\u201cThey have no investigatorial, prosecutorial powers, and they must respect the rights of people appearing,\u201d she said.\nThe Vice President said she was consulting her lawyers regarding the possibility of taking the legislators to court and that \u201cthey are ready\u201d to file cases against House members.\nBrother lets her stay\nHer brother informed Chua in a letter that he had given her permission to \u201cstay indefinitely in my office to discharge her day-to-day duties.\u201d\n\u201cThe Vice President\u2019s stay will also correspond to her visits to (Lopez) and other OVP personnel currently detained,\u201d he said, adding that she was \u201camenable\u201d to staying there even without water and electricity.\nThe Vice President told reporters that she could stay in her brother\u2019s office until New Year\u2019s Day.\nChua, sounding exasperated, asked whether \u201cwe need to remind the Vice President to follow the law.\u201d\n\u201cOur Vice President is a lawyer, she is the second-highest official of the land. We took an oath of service which stated that we will follow the rules of the land,\u201d Chua said.\nPlay for sympathy\nOther lawmakers also condemned Duterte\u2019s actions which they said was an attempt to influence the proceedings against her and even curry public sympathy for her as she continued to dodge the hearings into her confidential fund use.\nZambales Rep. Jay Khonghun said he couldn\u2019t help \u201cbut be suspicious of her motives of offering to join her chief of staff in detention,\u201d saying that she might just want to stop Lopez from testifying once the committee resumes its inquiry on Monday.\n\u201cOr is this just for show, another attempt at heroics? \u2026 Is this the Duterte brand?\u201d he asked. \u201cWhy is their behavior bereft of respect? Why act like a brat?\u201d\nACT Teachers Rep. France Castro also questioned Duterte\u2019s \u201cselective appearance\u201d at the House.\n\u201cIf she has nothing to hide, why doesn\u2019t she face us?

(AP Photo/Damian Dovarganes, File)\nEric Smalley\n,\nThe Conversation\nand\nMatt Williams\n,\nThe Conversation\nTikTok\nheaded to court on Sept. 16, 2024\n, in a bid to overturn a law that would force the video app to divorce from its China-based parent company or be banned in the US.\nDuring the appearance before a panel of judges at the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, lawyers for TikTok said imposing such a\nprohibition would have \u201cstaggering\n\u201d consequences for free speech.\nYour subscription could not be saved. Please try again.\nYour subscription has been successful.\nSubscribe to our daily newsletter\nSIGN ME UP\nBy providing an email address. I agree to the\nTerms of Use\nand acknowledge that I have read the\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nThe court hearing is the latest development in a lengthy saga over the fate of an app that is widely popular, especially among young Americans, but that many politicians in Washington fear poses or is a security risk.\nYou may like:\nHow TikTok grew from a fun app into a potential national security threat\nWhatever the outcome of the oral arguments presented by lawyers from the US government on one side and TikTok and parent company ByteDance on the other, it\u2019s unlikely to be the end of the story. Many analysts expect the case will head to the Supreme Court.\nADVERTISEMENT\nBut why is TikTok controversial? Are the claims of it being a national security risk valid? And what will the case mean for free speech? The Conversation\u2019s contributors have been on hand to answer these and other questions.\n1. An agent of the Chinese state?\nPoliticians who want to ban TikTok, or at least sever its links to China, fear that the app provides a way for the Chinese Communist Party to influence Americans or use their data for malicious purposes. But how much influence does the Chinese government have at TikTok? That question is addressed by\nShaomin Li\n, a scholar of China\u2019s political economy and business at Old Dominion University.\nLi explains that the\nrelationship between TikTok, ByteDance and the Chinese Communist Party is nuanced\n\u2013 it isn\u2019t simply a matter of officials in Beijing telling ByteDance to jump and the parent company dictating how high its subsidiary will leap. Rather, as with all companies in China, employees are under certain obligations when it comes to advancing national interests. In China, private enterprises, such as ByteDance, operate as joint ventures with the state.\nADVERTISEMENT\n\u201cRegardless of whether ByteDance has formal ties with the party, there will be the tacit understanding that the management is working for two bosses: the investors of the company and, more importantly, their political overseers that represent the party,\u201d Li writes. \u201cBut most importantly, when the interests of the two bosses conflict, the party trumps.\u201d\n2. Exploiting user data\nThe risks TikTok poses to US users are similar to the risks posed by many popular apps, principally that the app collects data about you. That data, which includes contact information and website tracking, plus all data you post and messages you send through the app, is available to use or misuse by ByteDance and any other entity that has or gains access to it.\nIowa State University cybersecurity researcher\nDoug Jacobson\nwrites that US officials and lawmakers are concerned that\nthe Chinese government could exploit TikTok user data\nto spy on US citizens. Government hackers could use the TikTok data to trick users into revealing more personal information.\nBut if the goal is to counter Chinese hackers, banning TikTok might prove too little, too late. \u201cBy some estimates, the Chinese government has already collected personal information on at least 80 percent of the US population via various means,\u201d Jacobson writes. \u201cThe Chinese government \u2013 along with anyone else with money \u2013 also has access to the large market for personal data.\u201d\n3. The security risks of a ban\nBanning TikTok could also make US users more vulnerable to hackers of all stripes. Rochester Institute of Technology computer security expert\nRobert Olson\nwrites that many of the more than 100 million US TikTok users could try to get around a ban on the app, with\nnegative consequences for their digital safety\n.\nYou may like:\nTikTok compares itself to foreign-owned American news outlets\nIf TikTok ends up banned from Apple\u2019s and Google\u2019s app stores, users could try to access the app elsewhere via sideloading. This practice of getting around Apple and Google app stores leaves users vulnerable to malware posing as the TikTok app. TikTok users might also be motivated to circumvent Apple and Google security controls in order to keep the app installed, a move that would make users\u2019 phones more vulnerable.\n\u201cI find it unlikely that a TikTok ban would be technologically enforceable,\u201d Olson writes. \u201cThis \u2026 legislation \u2013 aimed at improving cybersecurity \u2013 could motivate users to engage in riskier digital behavior.\u201d\n4. First Amendment concerns\nIn its legal challenge to the US government, ByteDance claims the government is violating its First Amendment rights. Technology law scholars\nAnupam Chander\nof Georgetown University and\nGautam Hans\nof Cornell University write that\nByteDance has grounds for its claim\n, and that the implications go beyond this case.\nTikTok is a publisher, an online publisher of users\u2019 videos. Forcing ByteDance to divest TikTok is a form of prior restraint \u2013 the government preventing speech before it occurs.\n\u201cBy forcing the sale of TikTok to an entity without ties to the Chinese Communist Party, Congress\u2019 intent with the law is to change the nature of the platform,\u201d they write. \u201cThat kind of government action implicates the core concerns that the First Amendment was designed to protect against: government interference in the speech of private parties.\u201d\n5. What about the others?\nSecurity and legal issues aside, the forced sale to a US-based company or ban of TikTok in the United States is a\nquestionable approach to solving the problems\nthe law aims to address: potential Chinese government influence in the US, harm to teens, and data privacy violations, writes Arizona State media scholar\nSarah Florini\n.\nThe Chinese government \u2013 and other US adversaries \u2013 has long used social media apps owned by US companies to attempt to influence American public opinion. TikTok is hardly alone in posing harm to teens, as the\nFacebook whistleblower case amply demonstrated\n. And vast amounts of Americans\u2019 personal data are already available to any buyer on the open and black markets.\n\u201cConcerns about TikTok are not unfounded, but they are also not unique. Each threat posed by TikTok has also been posed by US-based social media for over a decade,\u201d Florini writes.\nEric Smalley\n, Science + Technology Editor,\nThe Conversation\nand\nMatt Williams\n, Senior International Editor,\nThe Conversation\nThis article is republished from\nThe Conversation\nunder a Creative Commons license.

        "content": "The clashes and dangerous incidents between the Philippine Coast Guard and the China Coast Guard (CCG) in the West Philippine Sea, especially in the vicinity of Ayungin Shoal and more recently at Sabina Shoal, only highlight the scope and imminence of the Chinese threat to our sovereign rights and entitlements in the WPS.\nHowever, such threat is not limited to the provocative, dangerous, and illegal actions conducted by the CCG and maritime militia in the WPS. The Chinese threat also exists in the cyber realm and through China\u2019s efforts in cognitive warfare and influence operations. Taking that into account leads one to conclude that the threat posed by China to our national security lies not only in the waters of our exclusive economic zone in the WPS, but also within our homeland.\nNo surprise then that issues concerning the presence of Chinese workers in Philippine offshore gaming operators and the thousands of students in a province in northern Luzon have raised concerns about Chinese spies and sleeper cells. Aside from spies and sleeper cells, another concern is that of foreign agents being used by China to further the objectives of their foreign influence operations in the Philippines.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nA Jamestown Foundation report on Chinese influence operations in the Philippines states that the aim is to sow discord in the country\u2019s domestic politics to encourage the population to focus on internal conflicts and tensions rather than on outside threats. These operations also want to weaken the United States-Philippine defense alliance and promote a pro-People\u2019s Republic of China government in Manila, and thus shape public opinion in the Philippines into supporting Beijing\u2019s claims in the South China Sea (SCS).\nFEATURED STORIES\nOPINION\nUrgent action needed vs online piracy as Congress session nears end\nOPINION\nLife has shortened\nOPINION\nThe gift of second chances\nFortunately, there appears to be a general awareness of these threats and the issues behind them, given the widespread public debates and discussions in various platforms and media. However, we must be mindful throughout this process of avoiding sweeping accusations. The efforts to root out the spies and foreign agents acting against the country\u2019s security and interests must be precise and based on solid legal grounds. The actions we take in the waters of the WPS are a clear example of that, as it has a strong legal basis under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (Unclos) and the 2016 SCS arbitral ruling.\nIn dealing with spies and foreign agents, actions and efforts in that area should likewise be guided and governed by existing laws, namely, Commonwealth Act No. 616, concerning espionage and spies, and Batas Pambansa (BP) No. 39 in the case of foreign agents. In the case of Commonwealth Act No. 616, Senate Bill No. 2368 has been introduced to amend and update its provisions to make them more responsive to present circumstances.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nMeanwhile, the purpose of BP 39 is \u201cto regulate the activities of foreign agents and to require them to register and to disclose their political activities in the Republic of the Philippines.\u201d This means there is nothing wrong with being a registered foreign agent unless he or she violates Section 11 of BP 39, which defines what constitute unlawful acts on their part.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nIt\u2019s worth mentioning as well that there is a distinct difference between a spy and a foreign agent. This distinction is important because while a spy can be a foreign agent duly registered under our country\u2019s law, not all foreign agents are spies.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThe threats and risks posed by spies and foreign agents are quite real, however, and cannot be discounted. In fact, Defense Secretary Gilberto Teodoro recently called on Congress to amend the espionage act to make it effective even in times of peace and not just during war.\nBut we must also act responsibly in dealing with spies and foreign agents. Rooting them out should be in accordance with the law, since making sweeping accusations without legal basis is more likely to undermine our position and sway public opinion on our policies.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nJust as we base our claims of sovereignty in the WPS under the rule of law as embodied by Unclos and the 2016 arbitral ruling, our efforts to protect the country from enemies within should likewise be based on solid legal foundations, such as Commonwealth Act No. 616 and BP 39.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\nYour subscription could not be saved.

Elsa/Getty Images/AFP\nDALLAS \u2014 The New York Yankees wanted to bring Juan Soto back but the organization ultimately saw him depart for a historic 15-year, $765 million deal with the crosstown Mets.\n\u201cOwnership and the front office, I think, did everything we could to make it happen,\u201d Yankees manager Aaron Boone said during the winter meetings on Tuesday. \u201cIt just didn\u2019t happen. But, as I told these guys yesterday, that\u2019s sports.\u201d\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nSoto\u2019s departure is shocking in many ways. The Yankees made an aggressive push to bring him back and, given their storied history, they don\u2019t lose players they want often.\nFEATURED STORIES\nSPORTS\nLeo Austria returns as coach, Beermen immediately rediscover form\nSPORTS\nPBA: Leo Austria back as San Miguel head coach\nSPORTS\nPBA: Ginebra crushes Phoenix for back to back wins\nREAD:\nJuan Soto\u2019s 3-run homer in 10th sends Yankees into World Series\nIt also leaves a massive hole in their lineup as Soto and Aaron Judge were one of the most dangerous duos in years. Soto batted .288 with 41 home runs and 109 RBIs last season.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nIt turned out to be his only season in pinstripes after the Yankees acquired him and Trent Grisham from the San Diego Padres for five players, knowing Soto would become an unrestricted free agent after one year.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\n\u201cUltimately, Juan earned the right to be in the position that he\u2019s in, and he made a decision that he felt like was best,\u201d Boone said. \u201cWe went into this eyes wide open. It was a year ago when we were sitting here, and I remember making the deal at the winter meetings. We knew there was no guarantees of anything moving forward. I think as much as it hurt to make the deal with some of the players that we lost, looking back, I feel like it was the right thing to do and served us well. He had an amazing season obviously with us.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nREAD:\nWorld Series: Aaron Judge is flailing, Yankees sinking along with him\n\u201cIt kind of hurts in the moment, but when you live in the business and you live in the sport \u2014 again, it is sports, it doesn\u2019t always go your way. It\u2019s now an opportunity for us to \u2014 and our expectation is to still go out and build and put together a great team to go compete for a championship again next year. That doesn\u2019t stop.\u201d\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nSasaki insight\nThe biggest development during Day 2 was a media scrum with Joel Wolfe, the agent for Japanese phenom Roki Sasaki. Wolfe shed some light into the anticipated pursuit of Sasaki, saying a team from a smaller market with a smaller media pool could be attractive to him.\n\u201cI think that there\u2019s an argument to be made that a smaller, mid-market team might be more beneficial for him as a soft landing,\u201d Wolfe said.\nWolfe said the media in Japan had been \u201cvery tough\u201d on Sasaki.\nSasaki will draw plenty of interest coming off a season in which he went 10-5 with a 2.35 ERA and 129 strikeouts. And, despite small- to mid-market teams possibly making more sense, it\u2019s still early in the process and big-market teams will make their pitches. Boone didn\u2019t shy away when asked about Sasaki on Tuesday.\n\u201cI think there\u2019s no better place to do it than in New York with the pinstripes,\u201d Boone said. \u201cAnd I think we have a lot to offer him in not only his development, but I think it\u2019s clear we\u2019re talking about a potentially dominant major league starting pitcher.\u201d\nHometown talk\nThe Texas Rangers were the toast of baseball at the winter meetings a year ago, coming off the franchise\u2019s first World Series championship. They had a frustrating 2024, though, posting a losing record and missing the playoffs.\nBut the Rangers are confident they can rebound in 2025. The biggest room for improvement may come from within.\n\u201cWe have a very good core. We won a world championship with these guys,\u201d manager Bruce Bochy said. \u201cSome of them had down years. Silver lining is that it\u2019s hopefully motivating them even more.\u201d\nBochy specifically mentioned Leody Taveras, Adolis Garcia and Jonah Heim as players who are spending the offseason working out at the ballpark.\n\u201cThese guys are determined to show that last year was a fluke,\u201d Bochy said. \u201cTo me, that\u2019s the only way we\u2019re going to get better.\u201d\nCould Harper lead off?\nPhiladelphia Phillies\u2019 Bryce Harper practices before the baseball NL Championship Series against the Arizona Diamondbacks, Sunday, Oct. 15, 2023, in Philadelphia. The Phillies host Game 1 on Monday, Oct. 16. (AP Photo/Matt Slocum)\nSpring training is still weeks away and Opening Day is even further down the road. But it\u2019s never too early to talk about lineups.\nPhiladelphia Phillies manager Rob Thomson was asked about Bryce Harper moving into the leadoff role like Shohei Ohtani with the Dodgers and Francisco Lindor with the Mets. Harper has batted leadoff in 38 games in his career, the last coming in 2022. He batted third exclusively last season.\nBut Thomson acknowledged it is something he\u2019s thought about.\n\u201cThat\u2019s something that would be a long conversation, I think,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure Bryce would be willing to go there. I think the more at-bats you get for the best hitters, the better chances you have. That\u2019s the idea behind it.\u201d\nDefining success\nThe Chicago White Sox made history for the wrong reasons in 2024, losing a record 121 games. First-year manager Will Venable has been brought in to help rebuild the organization after spending the past two seasons with the Rangers being groomed for this type of job by Bochy.\nStill, what will success look like? A 20-win improvement would still translate to a 100-loss season.\n\u201cObviously wins and losses matter, and we\u2019ll all be judged on that,\u201d Venable said. \u201cIt\u2019s also about our players and did we support them to get better? Did they get better and continue to develop? Then did we do the things internally with our infrastructure and our systems and processes to set us up for success in the future, too? There\u2019s a lot of work being done behind the scenes.\nYour subscription could not be saved.

This is soft power, and it rests on our cultural identity, creative expression, and ecological stewardship.\u201d\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nREAD:\nLegarda cites importance of PH Studies courses\nFEATURED STORIES\nNEWSINFO\nBar exam 2024: List of successful examinees\nNEWSINFO\n3 schools have highest percentage of passers among first-time bar exam takers\nNEWSINFO\nHouse panel: Ex-president Duterte center of grand criminal enterprise\nLegarda recounted her advocacies and initiatives in advancing the country\u2019s cultural diplomacy, including the Philippines\u2019 historic return to the Venice Biennale in 2015 after a 51-year absence, which she championed as the prime mover. \u201cOur reentry into the Venice Biennale redefined global engagement by centering on human stories and sparking collective action for positive change,\u201d she said.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThe senator also highlighted the Philippines\u2019 forthcoming role as Guest of Honour at the 2025 Frankfurt Book Fair, the world\u2019s largest literary event. Legarda worked tirelessly to secure this prestigious participation, driven by a vision to elevate Filipino ingenuity and storytelling on the global stage. \u201cIf other nations have carved their place on this prestigious stage, why not the Philippines? Why shouldn\u2019t our luminous literary heritage be celebrated alongside the world\u2019s greatest voices?\u201d she shared, emphasizing her belief in the brilliance of the Filipino.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nLegarda shared how the Philippines will showcase the richness of Filipino imagination under the theme, \u201cThe Imagination Peoples the Air,\u201d inspired by Dr. Jose Rizal\u2019s ideals of enlightenment and empowerment. She also reflected on her visit to Wilhelmsfeld, Germany, where Rizal stayed in 1886, and wrote the last chapters of Noli Me Tangere.&nbsp; The four-term shared a significant milestone in cultural diplomacy by announcing that the historic vicarage of Pastor Ullmer in Wilhelmsfeld, Germany\u2014where Dr. Jose Rizal stayed for three months\u2014will soon belong to the Philippines.\nUpon learning that the property was placed on the market, she took decisive steps to secure it for the nation. \u201cThis vicarage stands as a testament to Rizal\u2019s ability to transcend barriers through the brilliance of his mind and the humanity of his spirit amidst a time of oppression and discrimination,\u201d she said. The acquisition ensures that this symbol of Filipino cultural diplomacy will be preserved as a vital connection to the country\u2019s rich heritage.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nBeyond cultural diplomacy, Legarda stressed the strategic role of soft power in driving urgent climate action. A steadfast leader in climate advocacy, she initiated the Manila Call to Action on Climate Change, led the Philippines\u2019 efforts within the Climate Vulnerable Forum (CVF), and played a key role in securing the Paris Agreement.\nLegarda also highlighted her ongoing efforts to address climate challenges, such as advocating for the Senate\u2019s concurrence on the High Seas Treaty and funding key activities leading to the 2025 United Nations Oceans Conference in Nice, France. She expressed pride in the Philippines hosting the Fund for Loss and Damage Board, recognizing the country\u2019s commitment to equity and climate justice.\n\u201cSoft power is anything but soft,\u201d Legarda, the UNDRR Global Champion for Resilience, asserted. \u201cIt reshapes perceptions, transforms societies, and fosters collaboration. When wielded with purpose, it allows us to lead by example and offer the world a model for resilience, sustainability, and harmony.\u201d\nWith her visionary leadership in cultural and climate diplomacy, Legarda continues to redefine how the Philippines navigates and influences the global stage, bridging divides and championing shared aspirations for a sustainable future.\nYour subscription could not be saved.

Should we care about how the US election is shaping up?\nThe answer, and perhaps the safest answer: We should, at least, monitor it.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nA military ally in the West Philippine Sea\nThe United States is one of the allies\u2013if not the primary ally\u2013of the Philippines in our fight for sovereignty in the West Philippine Sea.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nDue to recent aggression by China against Philippine vessels in West Philippine Sea, proposals to invoke the Mutual Defense Treaty (MDT) between Manila and Washington have grown louder.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThe MDT is a 73-year old military agreement between Manila and Washington which calls for each other\u2019s defense in case of an armed attack\u2013including in the West Philippine Sea.\n\u201cThe US election will certainly impact the geopolitical fate of two allied states on how they will address issues on asymmetrical trade and security in the Indo-Pacific region,\u201d Dr. Chester Cabalza, president and founder of Manila-based think tank International Development and Security Cooperation, told INQUIRER.net.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThe MDT, however, is not the only military agreement the Philippines has with the US.\nThis year alone, four new locations were identified as additional sites for the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (Edca), not to mention the annual military exercises and joint patrols between Manila and Washington in Philippine waters.\nEdca allows the US to rotate troops in the Philippines for extended stays and the US to build and operate facilities on Philippine bases for both American and Philippine forces.\nAccording to Cabalza, a leadership change in the US may be a \u201cboon and bane\u201d for Philippines security, especially with standing agreements the two countries have.\n\u201cAs a friend of the US, Filipinos should see the electoral change in the White House as a boon and bane if Washington will fulfill its treaty obligations with Manila as both countries mutually expanded naval and aerial bases in northern and western parts of the Philippines,\u201d Cabalza said.\nSo when the election is over, what will happen to the Philippines?\nA Harris win may simply mean a continuation of the working relationship between Manila and Washington, taking off from the relationship between the administration of President Bongbong Marcos and the administration of US President Joe Biden.\nIn September 2023, Marcos and Harris met on the sidelines of the 43rd Association of Southeast Asian Nations Summit in Jakarta where among the issues they discussed was the West Philippine Sea. During their meeting, Harris reaffirmed the US\u2019 ironclad commitment to the Philippines.\nThe doubts, however, arise from a possible Trump win.\nCabalza said he fears that Trump may lessen his focus on the West Philippine Sea and direct it to other conflicts in other parts of the globe.\n\u201cWith Trump\u2019s triumph, he may compartmentalize his foreign policy and lessen his focus on the West Philippine Sea as he will give more importance to current wars in Ukraine and Gaza,\u201d Cabalza said.\n\u201cHis comeback will also change the contours and the security landscape in the region as he may halt the defense developments in the Edca sites,\u201d he added.\nGeopolitical analyst and De La Salle University Department of International Studies lecturer Don McLain Gill pointed out that during Trump\u2019s term as president of the US, there were also attempts to strengthen Washington\u2019s relationship with Manila.\nHowever, then Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte pivoted towards China and gave cold shoulder treatment to the US, not allowing the Philippines to maximize its negotiations with the Trump administration.\n\u201cThe Trump administration also rejected a huge percentage of China\u2019s expansionist claims over the South China Sea and the West Philippine Sea, in particular. In that regard, we could see how the Philippine-US alliance was significant,\u201d Gill told INQUIRER.net.\nGill, however, noted the stark difference between the foreign policy of Duterte, who aligned himself with China, and Marcos, who was more open to working with the US.\n\u201cWith Marcos Jr. however, I see a foreign policy that positions the Philippines as a proactive hub for like-minded cooperation as well as the Philippines\u2019 position in wanting to be a more proactive stakeholder in the rules-based order of the Indo-Pacific. I think that converges well with the Trump administration,\u201d Gill added.\nNonetheless, Gill stressed that there are still concerns over a Trump re-election, especially with the \u201cnegotiation-driven approach\u201d of the former US president.\nWill Manila still be a priority for Trump?\nGill said he believes that the Indo-Pacific region will still be a \u201cclear\u201d priority for Trump, given the escalating tension between the US and China.\n\u201cThis would rely on Manila\u2019s ability to present itself as an important stakeholder and important element in the Indo-Pacific geopolitics because we are a frontliner state. We are acutely affected by the US-China power competition. It\u2019s up to how we are able to convey that message to a Trump administration,\u201d Gill said.\n\u201cWe cannot just expect without making more of an effort in the negotiations and dialogues with the US as well,\u201d he added.\nFor now, only time can tell what will happen with US-Philippines ties should Trump win, although it is important to note that Philippine Ambassador to the United States Jose Manuel Romualdez stressed that the MDT will remain unchanged, regardless of who becomes the next US president.\nRomualdez said that while a Trump comeback could bring shifts in economic policy, the defense relations between Manila and Washington would remain intact.\nFilipinos in the US\nWhile results of the US elections may not directly impact Filipinos here in the Philippines, these could affect millions of Filipinos residing in the States.\nAs of 2022, there are about 4.1 million Filipino-Americans living in the US, according to data from the US Census Bureau.\nImmigration is one of the issues at the forefront of the US presidential elections.\nA Pew Research Center report states that about 61 percent of US voters say immigration is very important to their vote. This figure is a 9 percentage point increase from the 2020 presidential election.\nHarris is pushing for comprehensive immigration reforms, such as providing pathways to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.\nThe vice president also said in a visit to Arizona in September that anyone crossing the border illegally would be barred from seeking asylum in the US. But \u201chard-working migrants\u201d who come to the US legally should be given a pathway to citizenship, she said.\nIf there\u2019s one issue that has served as a cornerstone of the Trump campaign, it is immigration.\nIf he is successful in staging a comeback to the White House, Trump intends to initiate what he calls as the \u201cbiggest domestic deportation operation in US history.\u201d\nThe proposal will affect millions of undocumented individuals in the US, including undocumented Filipinos.\nIn 2017, the Philippine government prepared for the deportation of some 10,000 Filipinos who may be evicted from the US after the Trump administration rescinds a program that allows undocumented immigrant children to stay legally there.\nTrump\u2019s immigration policy may also limit opportunities for Filipinos who wish to try their luck in the US.\n\u201c[This could affect] those who want to pursue a career path or education in the US. With immigration tighter or new immigration policies or longer bureaucratic processes could significantly impact the social aspect of the people-to-people relationship between the US and the Philippines,\u201d Gill said.\nFor context, an INQUIRER.net report states that in 2022, the Philippines ranked as one of the leading countries of origin for immigrants to the United States, representing a notable four percent of the total immigrant population.\nUS-China\u2026 and the Philippines\nRegardless of who wins the US presidential elections, the power struggle between the US and China will continue\u2013and caught in the middle is the Philippines.\n\u201cThe US remains as the strongest state in hard and soft powers that\u2019s why the Philippines and the world have strategic interests in its current election,\u201d Cabalza said.\nAccording to Cabalza, the election of a new US leader will affect global geopolitics and economy, as well as whether the US will maintain its superpower role in the world, especially with the rising threat of China.\n\u201cIt matters to all of us, as the world order may see sudden alteration under the new leader of the US,\u201d Cabalza said.\nThe fact is, whatever happens between the US and China will have an impact on other countries, but more so on the Philippines which is geographically near China.\nGeopolitically speaking, the Philippines is also at the intersection of the traditional sphere of US influence and the emergence of China\u2019s power projection, according to Gill. Thus, a radical change in the global power structure will have an impact on the Philippines.\nGill explained that China\u2019s challenges and expansionist ambitions in the West Philippine Sea have become an \u201cexistential threat\u201d to the Philippines, which relies on the US as a security partner.\n\u201cIf the US would decrease its involvement, that could be a problem for our overarching foreign policy security calculations given that the US is our traditional security provider and traditional ally,\u201d Gill said.\nShould China also challenge the US over Taiwan, the northern part of the Philippines, which is only a few nautical miles away from Taiwan, will also be immediately affected.\nThis concern is on top of the more than 200,000 overseas Filipino workers in Taiwan, Gill added.\nThis brings us back to a question in this long and arduous journey: Should the Philippines care about what\u2019s happening in the US?\nYour subscription could not be saved.

I agree to the\nTerms of Use\nand acknowledge that I have read the\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nAnd this was supposed to make us all feel better about a second Trump presidency?\nDictator dreams\nYou\u2019ll recall last week, there was that New York Times report citing Trump\u2019s former chief of staff\nGen. John Kelly,\nwho believes Trump met the definition of a fascist and would rule like one.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThen there was General Mark Milley\u2019s declaration in Bob Woodward\u2019s new book that Trump definitely was a fascist.\nFinally, there was the Atlantic\u2019s story that not only revealed a racist President Trump reneging on paying for the funeral of a female Army recruit, a Mexican American bludgeoned to death by a fellow soldier, Trump saying, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t cost $60,000 to bury a fucking Mexican.\u201d\nOf course, Trump was just getting warmed up, as the story also revealed how Trump as president said, \u201cI need the kind of generals Hitler had.\u201d\nADVERTISEMENT\nThose are all charges that would be hard to doff off, unless none of us really care.\nBut we all should.\nEspecially Asian Americans. Many of us are in the US because we escaped more current (post-World War II) and no less offensive despots than Hitler.\nChina has oppressed the Tibetans and the Uighurs. My late friend Dith Pran would always remind me of Pol Pot of Cambodia. And let\u2019s not forget Bangladesh, Burma, the list goes on.\nBut Philippines\u2019 Ferdinand Marcos is always near and dear to our hearts. An authoritarian puppet supported by Reagan and Bush, big Daddy Marcos had human rights stats from the \u201960s to the \u201880s in the Philippines that are monumental: 3,257 known extrajudicial killings, 35,000 people tortured, more than 700 people disappeared, 70,000 people incarcerated.\nMost of them were political opponents who dared to cry out for freedom.\nCould this happen in America?\nIt did in the Philippines where we saw what happened to those deemed \u201cthe enemy from within.\u201d Ironically, that\u2019s now a favorite Trump phrase.\nAnd there\u2019s no taking it back.\nInstead of denying his fascist tendencies when the news stories came out last week, Trump went after the generals and reporters, who frankly have more credibility than he does.\nAnd then just to prove who he really is, Trump followed up all the fascist talk with what he must consider his best defense\u2014an unabashed cranked up Madison Square Garden party of racism, sexism and hate last weekend.\nThe rally doppelganger and the most offensive joke\nFor longtime political watchers it had to be like attending their first soft Klan rally.\nThis was a non-hooded, but still an inappropriate display, more fitting perhaps at a comedy club, not a political event. In fact, some observers saw it eerily similar to the second coming of a neo-Nazi assembly at the old Madison Square Garden in 1939.\nThe most offensive and ill-advised joke/comment may have been from Tony Hinchcliffe, the comedian/host of the podcast \u201cKill Tony,\u201d and a Tom Brady Roast standout. He\u2019s become a key gatekeeper of young comedians who seek his blessing to launch their careers. In the comedy world, Hinchcliffe is seen as a kingmaker.\nBut on Sunday, Hinchcliffe\u2019s \u201cKill Tony\u201d magic was more like \u201cKill Trump\u201d as Hinchcliffe rocked the political world with this joke: \u201cThere\u2019s literally a floating island of garbage in the middle of the ocean right now, trash in the middle of the ocean and I think it\u2019s called Puerto Rico.\u201d\nFunny at a comedy venue maybe, but at an event in New York City, it\u2019s a joke that could cost the former president.\nConsider that in the battleground state of Pennsylvania alone there are nearly 500,000 Puerto Rican voters. Nationwide. there are about 5.9 million Puerto Ricans in the US. If they\u2019re naturalized, they can vote, and in a close race like this year\u2019s presidency, Trump needs all the votes he can get.\nBut if they live on the island, Puerto Ricans are second-class Americans who have no vote and no representation in Congress.\nEither way, there\u2019s nothing funny about Puerto Rico\u2019s status. The joke was offensive.\nIt\u2019s why Puerto Ricans, about five times smaller than the Asian American vote, immediately raised a stink with members of Congress who were highly critical of Trump and the jokesters. But so were those like Florida\u2019s Republican Senator Rick Scott who needs the Puerto Rican vote.\nThat\u2019s some leverage on the part of the Puerto Ricans. Move over Taylor Swift, here came JLo and Bad Bunny to the rescue.\nThink about how AAPI compare. Did any AAPI person except me raise an issue about the misidentification of Harris by another Madison Square Garden speaker Tucker Carlson?\nTrump PR folks disavowed the Hinchcliffe joke and the others in an attempt to make the problem go away. But they sure didn\u2019t disavow Trump and his speech advocating for racist policies like the largest deportation program in American history.\nThere was also nothing to soften Trump\u2019s s \u201cenemy from within\u201d talk that includes not just immigrants, but politicians and \u201cthe press.\u201d\nWhat are we left with? Just what Trump wants: Fear, hate, racism, sexism, misogyny. It\u2019s Trump\u2019s closing argument. He didn\u2019t want to have another debate, or a rigorous interview, Trump wanted his garden party to showcase his detestable MAGA-based rhetoric.\nWith all the media and most Americans expressing disapproval, how can voters still say they prefer the jokers\u2019 inspiration, Donald Trump?\nTrump\u2019s first words after he came to the rally stage was a question: \u201cAre you better off than you were four years ago?\u201d\nFrankly, four years ago we were relieved, thought to be done with Trump.\nBut when Trump continued to lie after his election loss and even staged an attempted coup, the country\u2019s been in a funk, living in the shadow of Trump\u2019s whining and historic criminal prosecution.\nTo date, Trump still hasn\u2019t learned his lesson about the peaceful transition of power. A new poll says nearly 70 percent fear if Trump loses this time he won\u2019t concede.\nSo, are we better off now than we were four years ago?\nAs long as Trump is kept in check, for democracy\u2019s sake, yes, we are.\nIf not, that Trump rally signals we could have a long and ugly four years ahead.\nEmil Guillermo is a journalist and commentator.

        "content": "It was quite fitting that President Marcos\u2019 first bilateral meeting at the 44th and 45th Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) summits in Laos should be with the leader of Vietnam, a country with which the Philippines shares a mutual problem the rest of their neighbors don\u2019t (or can\u2019t) seem to acknowledge: China.\nShortly upon arriving in the Laotian capital of Vientiane last Tuesday, Mr. Marcos sat down with Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh to discuss \u201cnew areas of cooperation\u201d between Manila and Hanoi.\n\u201cWe have made a good deal of progress since our very first discussion and some of the engagements between our two countries. And I am very happy that we will be able to pursue that,\u201d Mr. Marcos told the Vietnamese leader, adding: \u201cAnd it also gives us the opportunity to explore new areas of cooperation and of partnership.\u201d\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nIn response, Chinh reaffirmed Vietnam\u2019s support for a strategic partnership with the Philippines, including earlier bilateral agreements on \u201cincident prevention in the South China Sea\u201d and \u201cmaritime cooperation\u201d between their coast guards.\nFEATURED STORIES\nOPINION\nUrgent action needed vs online piracy as Congress session nears end\nOPINION\nLife has shortened\nOPINION\nThe gift of second chances\nBrunt of intimidation\nNever before has there been such goodwill between the two Southeast Asian countries that currently bear the brunt of harassment and intimidation by their powerful neighbor to the north.\nIn late September, 10 Vietnamese nationals fishing in the disputed waters of Paracel Islands were allegedly mauled by Chinese personnel using iron bars, sparking furious condemnation from Vietnam\u2019s foreign ministry. In a rare statement addressing conflict involving a fellow Asean member, Manila voiced its support for Hanoi by saying it \u201cconsistently denounced the use of force, aggression, and intimidation in the South China Sea, and emphasized the need for actors to exercise genuine self-restraint.\u201d \u201cIt is a paramount obligation to ensure the safety at sea of vessels and their crew, especially fisherfolk,\u201d the Department of Foreign Affairs added.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nAs safely crafted as the statement was, it was a significant step toward a potential alliance with Vietnam and what might be the beginning of a united front against a common adversary. But for obvious reasons, Vietnam has been reticent in accepting the Philippines\u2019 friendly overtures, unwilling to further antagonize China. In August, for instance, Malaca\u00f1ang was forced to remove a reference in its social media posts about Hanoi\u2019s purported support for Manila\u2019s 2016 arbitral victory against Beijing, during a visit by Vietnam\u2019s defense minister.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nA \u2018strong message\u2019 to China\nBut it can\u2019t be denied that there has been progress. In the same month, the coast guards of the Philippines and Vietnam staged maritime drills together off Corregidor Island and used water cannons for the first time, a move an analyst described as a \u201cstrong message\u201d to China, whose own coast guard had been water-blasting Philippine vessels in a series of confrontations in the West Philippine Sea, the name Manila uses for the waters within its 370-kilometer exclusive economic zone.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\n\u201cIf the Philippines and Vietnam will succeed in this calculated maritime endeavor \u2026 a greater optimism is foreseen, as China may rethink its unilateral option of claiming the entirety of the South China Sea,\u201d said Chester Cabalza, founder of Manila-based think tank International Development and Security Co.\nWhile Vietnam and the Philippines are headed toward a deepening, if uneasy, friendship, the other members of the 10-nation Asean remain apathetic to the hostile actions of Beijing toward fellow South China Sea claimants.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nFor years, China has expanded its presence in the disputed waterway, building artificial islands with missile systems and runways for fighter jets. Worst of all, it has deployed vessels that routinely obstruct Philippine sailors and fishers using water cannons and lasers.\n\u2018Silence diminishes Asean\u2019\nYet, little has been heard from the regional bloc beyond the usual platitudes and calls for \u201crestraint and respect for international law,\u201d which have accomplished nothing except to embolden China and bring the Philippines closer to its western allies, like the United States, than its own neighbors.\nWho could blame the soft-spoken Mr. Marcos for his stern language during the closed-door retreat summit on Wednesday, when he reportedly warned Asean \u201cnot to turn a blind eye\u201d to aggressors in the South China Sea? \u201cSilence in the face of these violations diminishes Asean,\u201d the Philippine leader said, according to a copy of his speech that was leaked to reporters in Laos.\nHe is correct, though. Ultimately, it\u2019s not only the Philippines and Vietnam that are weakened by China\u2019s brazen moves, but Asean itself.\nYour subscription could not be saved.

The Switzerland-based World Economic Forum describes Asean\u2014the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations\u2014as the world\u2019s \u201ceconomic dark horse.\u201d Its combined population of 685 million makes it the third-largest market in the world, next to India and China. It thus wields demographic power and is now acknowledged as a driver of the global economy.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThe Asean countries share a common geography and ethnicities, but the economic disparities among them are wide. Average income in the richest member Singapore ($91,100 in 2023) is 77 times that in the poorest member Myanmar ($1,180). Price stability ranges from very stable (with Brunei\u2019s and Thailand\u2019s annual inflation rates of 0.4 and 1.2 percent, respectively) to hyperinflationary (Laos with 31.2 and Myanmar with 27.1 percent). The jobs situation ranges from virtual full employment in Cambodia and Thailand, with unemployment rates of 0.5 and 1.0 percent this year, to Indonesia\u2019s 5.3 percent. Exports-to-GDP ratio ranges from dynamic Singapore\u2019s 108.9 percent to inward-looking Philippines\u2019 measly 12.7 percent (regional average is 55.9 percent). Education outcomes range from globally top-ranked Singapore to bottom-dwellers Philippines and Cambodia (77th and 81st, respectively) in the 2022 Programme for International Student Assessment or Pisa. With such wide disparities, it would be ideal if the US and China help the region with a \u201crising tide that lifts all boats\u201d so that the wide inequalities both across and within countries in Asean could somehow be narrowed.\nFEATURED STORIES\nOPINION\nUrgent action needed vs online piracy as Congress session nears end\nOPINION\nLife has shortened\nOPINION\nThe gift of second chances\nI was invited last week to a candid dialogue in Thailand on how China and the US are helping Southeast Asia. My assigned focus was on their economic contributions to the region. These come via trade, investment, economic assistance, tourism, labor migration, and more. I focused on the first three, which are the most prominent elements in the relationship, and for which data are readily available.\nChina is Asean\u2019s largest trading partner, which is not surprising being right next door. Even so, the US actually took the lead from China early this year as the biggest buyer of Asean\u2019s exports, even from the other side of the world. Trade balance with the US has consistently been in Asean\u2019s favor, with a $200-billion trade surplus; that is, Asean sells more to the US than it buys from it, by that much. The reverse is true with China, which sells more to Asean than it buys, by about $100 billion, and this Asean trade deficit with China has grown tenfold since 2010, in an increasingly lopsided trade.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nAs to foreign direct investments, the US is Asean\u2019s largest source, with $74.4 billion in FDI inflows in 2023. China comes in fourth with FDI flows of $17.3 billion, behind the European Union\u2019s $24.9 billion and Asean cross-investments of $21.9 billion. American investments have been shifting to Asean since the US-China trade war and the COVID-19 pandemic led American manufacturers in China to shift out or add back-up factories in Asean, to the great benefit of the region.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nChina\u2019s economic assistance comes mainly as soft loans for large infrastructure projects under the Belt and Road Initiative. In 2021, it pivoted to a Global Development Initiative promoting \u201cpeople-centered, high-quality, green, and innovation-driven development.\u201d The US Agency for International Development delivers a smaller but comprehensive package of grant assistance covering a wide range of areas including governance, education, health care, agriculture, manufacturing, renewable energy, digital economy, trade facilitation, and workforce development\u2014all aimed to support economic growth, poverty reduction, and sustainable development in Asean. US grants and soft loans uphold labor and environmental standards, transparency, accountability, and human rights, which some see as intrusive conditionalities. While Chinese soft loan projects have no such \u201cstrings\u201d attached, they provoke concerns about a lack of labor and environmental safeguards, looming \u201cdebt traps,\u201d and the prospect of giving up state assets in the event of default. Their assistance with connectivity infrastructure is also feared to carry the risk of data security, cyber-espionage, and over-dependence.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThere are pros and cons on each side. But rather than see it as a contest for the region, the dialogue agreed that complementation or even cooperation, rather than competition, would be in the best interest of Southeast Asia, and in turn, the world. However, current geopolitical realities make this little more than wishful thinking.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\ncielito.habito@gmail.com\nYour subscription could not be saved.

(Associated Press Photo/Andy Wong)\nBEIJING \u2014 Starting next year, China will raise its retirement age for workers, which is now among the youngest in the world\u2019s major economies, in an effort to address its shrinking population and aging work force.\nThe Standing Committee of the National People\u2019s Congress, the country\u2019s legislature, passed the new policy Friday after a sudden announcement earlier in the week that it was reviewing the measure, state broadcaster CCTV announced.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThe policy change will be carried out over 15 years, with the retirement age for men raised to 63 years, and for women to 55 or 58 years depending on their jobs. The current retirement age is 60 for men and 50 for women in blue-collar jobs and 55 for women doing white-collar work.\nFEATURED STORIES\nBUSINESS\nMore foreign brands seen coming to PH shores in 2025\nBUSINESS\nGlobal Dominion: Simplifying financing to empower every Filipino\nBUSINESS\nInternational group kicks off infrastructure investment drive for PH\n\u201cWe have more people coming into the retirement age, and so the pension fund is (facing) high pressure. That\u2019s why I think it\u2019s now time to act seriously,\u201d said Xiujian Peng, a senior research fellow at Victoria University in Australia who studies China\u2019s population and its ties to the economy.\nREAD:\nDownside of extended retirement age\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThe previous retirement ages were set in the 1950\u2019s, when life expectancy was only around 40 years, Peng said.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThe policy will be implemented starting in January, according to the announcement from China\u2019s legislature. The change will take effect progressively based on people\u2019s birthdates.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nFor example, a man born in January 1971 could retire at the age of 61 years and 7 months in August 2032, according to a chart released along with the policy. A man born in May 1971 could retire at the age of 61 years and 8 months in January 2033.\nDemographic pressures made the move long overdue, experts say. By the end of 2023, China counted nearly 300 million people over the age of 60. By 2035, that figure is projected to be 400 million, larger than the population of the U.S. The Chinese Academy of Social Sciences had previously projected that the public pension fund will run out of money by that year.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nPressure on social benefits such as pensions and social security is hardly a China-specific problem. The United States also faces the issue as analysis shows that currently, the Social Security fund won\u2019t be able to pay out full benefits to people by 2033.\n\u201cThis is happening everywhere,\u201d said Yanzhong Huang, senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cBut in China with its large elderly population, the challenge is much larger.\u201d\nPeople on their bicycles and electric bikes wait at a traffic lights junction during the morning rush hour in Beijing, Friday, Sept. 13, 2024. \u2013 China will raise its retirement age for workers, which is now among the youngest in the world\u2019s major economies, starting next year. (Associated Press Photo/Andy Wong)\nThat is on top of fewer births, as younger people opt out of having children, citing high costs. In 2022, China\u2019s National Bureau of Statistics reported that for the first time, the country had 850,000 fewer people at the end of the year than the previous year, a turning point from population growth to decline. In 2023, the population shrank further by 2 million people.\nWhat that means is that the burden of funding elderly people\u2019s pensions will be divided among a smaller group of younger workers, as pension payments are largely funded by deductions from people who are currently working.\nResearchers measure that pressure by looking at a number called the dependency ratio, which counts the number of people over the age of 65 compared to the number of workers under 65. That number was 21.8 percent in 2022, according to government statistics, meaning that roughly five workers would support one retiree. The percentage is expected to rise, meaning fewer workers will be shouldering the burden of one retiree.\nREAD:\nReform retirement system\nThe necessary course correction will cause short-term pain, experts say, coming at a time of already high youth unemployment and a soft economy.\nA 52-year-old Beijing resident, who gave his family name as Lu and will now retire at age 61 instead of 60, was positive about the change. \u201cI view this as a good thing, because our society\u2019s getting older, and in developed countries, the retirement age is higher,\u201d he said.\nLi Bin, 35, who works in the event planning industry, said she was a bit sad.\n\u201cIt\u2019s three years less of play time. I had originally planned to travel around after retirement,\u201d she said. But she said it was better than expected because the retirement age was only raised three years for women in white-collar jobs.\nSome of the comments on social media when the policy review was announced earlier in the week reflected anxiety.\nYour subscription could not be saved.

REITS (real estate investment trusts) will benefit from falling interest rates as investors look for yields. We also have a favorable view on Ayala Land Inc.\u2019s recent asset injection as it grew AREIT\u2019s portfolio and made it more diversified.\u201d\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nManila Electric Co.\n\u201cMeralco has more defensive earnings since it belongs to the power sector. Its high dividend yield also makes it attractive given expectations of falling interest rates.\u201d\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nJollibee Foods Corp.\n\u201cJFC was one of the notable outperformers during the second quarter. Profits for the period jumped 30.8 percent to P3 billion, bringing first half profits higher by 28.9 percent to P5.7 billion, which was much better than expected. Growth was driven by strong systemwide sales growth of 12.1 percent. What was even more impressive, though, was that the increase in systemwide sales was largely fueled by strong same store sales growth (SSSG) of 7.4 percent and not just store expansion. Moreover, while there were some international brands that encountered weakness as expected (Smashburger, Highlands Coffee and those in China), these were offset by the strength of its other brands, allowing overall SSSG of the international business to grow by 4.7 percent. Earnings before income tax (EBIT) margin likewise improved by 100 basis points (bp), helping profits grow even faster. Because of the strong second quarter performance, management raised its EBIT growth guidance to 18 to 20 percent for this year from 10 to 15 percent previously. The new guidance is also higher than COL\u2019s and consensus\u2019 growth forecasts of 10.2 percent and 13.9 percent, respectively. Aside from delivering better-than-expected second quarter earnings, we also have a favorable view on JFC\u2019s acquisition of a 75-percent stake in leading South Korean value coffee chain Compose Coffee for P19.9 billion. Compose Coffee currently operates 2,470 stores, which are 100-percent franchised, reducing capital expenditure requirements. Moreover, Compose Coffee will immediately be earnings-accretive as it reported revenues of P5.8 billion and core net income of P1.6 billion in full-year 2023. Upon consolidation, Compose will provide an incremental growth of 2 percent to JFC\u2019s revenues and 12 percent to EBIT.\u201d\nRon Acoba \u2014Contributed photos\nRon Acoba\nTrading Edge Consultancy chief investment strategist\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nApex Mining Co. \u201cI like APX because it will benefit from a likely rise in the global price of gold should the US start to cut its rates. APX is also cheap, trading at forward price to earnings (P/E) ratio of only 6.3x.\u201d\nACEN Corp.\n\u201cI like ACEN because it has already pivoted from a notable bullish reversal.\u201d\nDigiPlus Interactive Corp.\n\u201cI like PLUS because it is on a clear up leg. It has already cleared its long-time resistance at P12, which has allowed it to exceed P20. PLUS is also \u2018cheap,\u2019 trading at a forward P/E of only 10x.\u201d\nJayniel Carl Manuel\nJayniel Carl Manuel\nSeedbox Securities Inc. equities trader\nBank of the Philippine Islands\n\u201cThe banking sector is well-positioned to benefit from the current high-interest-rate environment. Banks like BPI are experiencing wider net interest margins, which is the difference between the interest earned on loans and the interest paid on deposits. This environment is particularly advantageous for banks with a significant portion of variable-rate loans, as it boosts profitability. BPI, being one of the major players in the sector, stands to gain from these favorable conditions.\u201d\nGlobe Telecom Inc.\n\u201cThe telecom sector is another area of interest, primarily due to the government\u2019s significant investment in telecom infrastructure. The Department of Information and Communications Technology has been proactive in supporting the growth of this sector, recognizing the critical role of internet connectivity in today\u2019s economy. Globe Telecom, as a leading provider, is well-positioned to capitalize on these infrastructure improvements and the increasing demand for reliable internet services, which are essential for both businesses and consumers.\u201d\nAREIT\n\u201cI\u2019m considering investments in the property sector, specifically in REITs like AREIT. REITs have gained popularity due to the sideways movement of the PSEi, which has led investors to seek out assets that offer stable returns. AREIT, with its high dividend yield, provides an attractive option for investors looking to maximize their earnings potential in a flat market. The historical performance of the PSEi over the past decade, which has shown limited upward movement, investors are increasingly turning to REITs for stable returns, making AREIT a solid choice.\u201d\nKervin Sisayan\u2014Maybank Securities\nKervin Sisayan\nMaybank Securities Inc. head of research\nSM Investments Corp.\u201cOn the retail side and the mall side, it\u2019s very consumer-centric domestically, people will spend a bit more on malls. BDO is already there, and if the economy picks up, loan growth will follow. If I had to choose one in the SM Group, it\u2019s SMIC because it\u2019s diversified.\u201d\nJollibee Foods Corp.\n\u201cPeople will still eat outside, and spending on QSR (quick service restaurants) could improve on declining rice prices. In addition, there could be further room to expand gross profit margins on declining input costs amid a declining inflation environment.\u201d\nAyala Land Inc.\n\u201cALI is doing really well on the high-end side. A decline in interest rates could provide a breather for affordable segments such as Avida of Ayala Land. In addition, the recent weakness in the Philippine peso could make local property prices more appealing to overseas Filipino workers.\u201d\nEstella Dhel Villamiel\nEstella Dhel Villamiel\nFirst Metro Securities head of institutional research department\n\u201cDespite the soft consumer environment and challenging macroeconomic conditions, we believe grocery retailers will deliver earnings growth in the second half of 2024. This outlook is based on the return of vendor support, which has led to higher-than-expected gross margins for listed retailers in the second quarter of 2024.\u201d\n\u201cIn the past quarter, food and beverage manufacturers experienced significant gross margin expansion due to lower year-on-year costs of key raw materials. Faced with slowing demand, these manufacturers reinvested their gains into demand-boosting initiatives, including vendor support efforts. These efforts involve close coordination with retailers for key promotions and market campaigns.\nWe anticipate that continued investment in these initiatives by manufacturers will support retailer margins in the second half of 2024. Key beneficiaries of this trend include Robinsons Retail Holdings, Puregold Price Club, and SM Investments Corp (for SM Retail). We have issued buy recommendations for these retailers.\u201d\nRobinsons Retail Holdings Inc.\n\u201cTarget price (TP) at P43: Due to higher supplier support and an improved product mix, management has upgraded their expected gross margin expansion to 20 to 40 bps (from 10-20 bps previously). We expect this to allow RRHI to deliver mid-to-high single-digit operating income growth this year. Additionally, sustained dividend payouts and share buybacks are supportive of shareholder returns.\u201d\nPuregold Price Club Inc.\n\u201cTP at P27.00: We expect earnings to stage a turnaround this year due to favorable base effects, the impact of aggressive store rollouts last year and the return of vendor support. More importantly, inflation coming off towards the lower end of the BSP\u2019s target range should provide relief to Puregold\u2019s target market, i.e., low-to-mid-income households.\u201d\nSM Investments Corp.\n\u201cTP at P1,030: Our bullish outlook on SMIC is anchored on its large economic moat across cyclical sectors, as it owns the largest bank, real estate developer and retailer in the Philippines. A cyclical upturn in the macroeconomic environment will lift the performance of its core businesses, especially its retailing arm, SM Retail.\u201d\n\u2014CONTRIBUTED PHOTO\nAstro del Castillo\nFirst Grade Finance Inc. managing director\nSM Prime Holdings\n\u201cAs the Philippines\u2019 leading mall developer, SM Prime benefits from a growing middle class and increasing consumer spending. Its diversified portfolio, including residential and commercial properties, provides stability.\u201d\nGlobe Telecom\n\u201cThe Philippines\u2019 digital economy is booming and Globe Telecom is a major player in the telecommunications industry.

        "content": "Almost a decade ago, when I was 18, this paper published a personal essay I had written about trains. Today I will talk about trains again.\nIn my 2015 essay, I shared my experiences from when I was a regular passenger of the LRT-1 and the MRT-3. I was a college student then, innocent to romantic love, so I romanticized everything: short-lived encounters, like eye contact with a fellow commuter, and other intangible things, like the way the distance feels shorter when you\u2019re on the same rail every day. My opening line: \u201cTrain rides are my first love.\u201d\nI\u2019m 27 now. I don\u2019t ride trains as often, and I think I\u2019ve come to learn a thing or two about first loves.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nFirst, I\u2019m pleased to report that I\u2019ve finally been on trains other than the LRT and the MRT. I\u2019ve been to Singapore and Hong Kong, and to my Filipino eye, the subway systems there are stunning. The trains are fast and on time (that they even have a timetable is amazing to me) and the various multicolored lines form a network that connects even places separated by rock and sea, a spiderweb of routes that I imagine would take years, if not decades, to build here at home. Inevitably, I compared my train experience in those places to our local realities. What if I could travel from Pasay to Bataan in a high-speed train beneath Manila Bay, instead of a ferry?\nFEATURED STORIES\nOPINION\nUrgent action needed vs online piracy as Congress session nears end\nOPINION\nLife has shortened\nOPINION\nThe gift of second chances\nWhen will there be a train service from Manila to Calamba? Will I ever be able to use my beep card at Mercury Drug? A girl can dream.\nNot only have I been on more trains; but I have also experienced \u201clove in transit\u201d in a deeper, fuller sense than during my teenage years. I have collected, like seashells, snapshots of love\u2014my very own, for the first time in my life\u2014in trains, planes, cars, buses, tricycles, jeeps, even on bikes and roller coasters and Ferris wheels. I have a treasure chest of those memories, but in keeping with the theme, I will relay only the train-related ones here, those fleeting seconds that formed part of the tapestry of two lives that once intersected like commuter rail lines: Playing Tetris on my phone on the train ride back from a long day at Ocean Park. The rush to catch the Airport Express because the A21 bus had not come as scheduled. The all-black outfits, the boots, and the tote bags of the people who, like us, had taken the train to the Esplanade for a concert. Wet from the rain on the train from Bugis, feet sore from walking all day. And, from long ago: the way his shirt brushed the back of my arm on the LRT to Carriedo, the late afternoon light on his face as he stood in front of me on the MRT to Shaw Boulevard, the butterflies in my stomach as we hugged and said \u201cSee you soon\u201d at the end of the LRT-2 line. It was at Katipunan Station. I was 22, the age that Taylor Swift single-handedly turned into a milestone year, and sure enough, I was falling in love.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nAnd then I was 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, each year full of innumerable joys, the highs and lows of being known to the bone. What a privilege it is to remember. It\u2019s true that forgetting might be gentler on the soul, and being the keeper of memories might look like a curse. But I think there is immense value in having the ability to put it all into words, hold it in one\u2019s hands, lift it up to the light, and resist, at least for a moment, the relentless march of time, the great obliterator.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThe significant and the mundane are all the same: I will revisit them, when I wish, like stations in my brain.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nI\u2019ll be going on a trip soon, to another country with nice trains. This time I will ride alone.\nMy parents, God bless them, worry about me being alone and far from home, however briefly, when I seem unwell. But I look forward to getting on those trains, to traveling from Point A to Point B in a city I\u2019ve never been in, to scanning faces in the rush hour crowd and wondering what their stories are, to learning how to be alone. For years, I had the incredible luck of living a life that did not need to be romanticized, but now I must carry on as I used to: with an eye for the soft in the rigid, the curve in the jagged, for comfort in this long, punishing silence.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThis essay, I suppose, is a marker of where I am right now. A time capsule. Here she is: a person navigating her late 20s, with a few more stripes on her belt than when she was 18, still a child. I smile at the MRT stories I told then\u2014I hadn\u2019t recalled them in years, but because they are preserved in prose, like flowers in amber, they cannot be fully lost to time. Perhaps when I\u2019m 40, I\u2019ll think of my 27-year-old self as a baby, too, and maybe I will read this and laugh.\nNicole-Anne Lagrimas, 27, is a former journalist.

        "content": "From a broader perspective, the tensions in the West Philippine Sea (South China Sea) are only secondarily due to our maritime territorial disputes with China. These tensions are primarily an offshoot of the worsening great power rivalry between the United States and China. That rivalry encompasses multiple issues and has its own dynamics. As a small nation caught in the middle of this complex conflict, we need to keep a firm view of our long-term interests, and where they lie at different points in time. We must be ready to defend these interests at all times, even as we must take care not to cause any provocation that may be exploited by either of the two major parties in this conflict.\nThis requires a balancing act that is delicate and uniquely ours to work out. We have been America\u2019s treaty ally in this part of the world since 1951, a consequence of having been its former colony. Japan invaded the Philippines at the start of World War II mainly because of the US military bases in the country. Six years after the end of that war, America made a commitment under the US-RP Mutual Defense Treaty of 1951 to defend the Philippines against any future external aggression.\nBut more than this treaty, it is the \u201cspecial relationship\u201d between the two countries that, for better or worse, has drawn the Philippines closer than any country in the Asean into the orbit of American geostrategic power. The US has always regarded the Philippines as its principal outpost in Southeast Asia. In turn, our nation\u2019s leaders have acknowledged this by finding ways to accommodate the presence of US forces in the country even after the expiration of the US-RP Military Bases Agreement in 1991. Today, we remain not only the most Westernized society in the region but indeed also the most Americanized. Every public opinion poll has confirmed the durability of this pro-US inclination. All these have unfortunately made our neighbors, not just China, see us as a willing tool of American interests.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nAware of what this connection to the US does to the country\u2019s prospects in an increasingly multipolar world, Filipino nationalist voices have constantly raised the need to diversify our economic and political relations in the world by adopting a foreign policy that is independent of the imperatives of American global power. A key issue in this debate has been our attitude toward China\u2019s steady rise as a global economic and military power.\nFEATURED STORIES\nOPINION\nUrgent action needed vs online piracy as Congress session nears end\nOPINION\nLife has shortened\nOPINION\nThe gift of second chances\nIn 1975, the Philippines under Marcos Sr. decided it was the right time to establish diplomatic relations with neighboring \u201cRed China\u201d despite the latter\u2019s ill-concealed support for the local Maoist rebel groups. That opening, however, did not happen in a vacuum. It took place in the context of the developing rapprochement between the US and China, starting with the 1971 visit of Henry Kissinger, Richard Nixon\u2019s national security adviser, followed by the pathbreaking visit of President Nixon himself the year after. It was not a coincidence that America\u2019s engagement with China was also happening at a time when Sino-Soviet relations had worsened to the point of imminent war between the two socialist powers.\nThus, from being perceived as an exporter of revolution to the Third World, China became the darling of the West overnight. The US eagerly opened its universities to China\u2019s young people, where they could learn the latest technology and, it was hoped, also the values that might transform China into a full-fledged capitalist society and democracy. In return, China opened its doors to the largest companies in the world, luring them with its abundant supply of cheap, hardworking, and docile workers, and its permissive environmental laws. The ultimate agenda of the Chinese leadership was, of course, to accelerate the acquisition of modern technology that they could apply to speed up the modernization of their own economy and military.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nFour decades of methodical and calibrated adoption of advanced Western technology and knowledge have brought China to where it is today\u2014a highly developed economy that leads the rest of the world in just about every area of cutting-edge technology, under the watchful eye of a highly disciplined communist party. It is this China that is today challenging US supremacy in nearly all domains\u2014economic, technological, military, etc. As China\u2019s leader Xi Jinping reminds his people, the era of submission to foreign domination is over. China has found and assumed its place in the modern world, and it is signaling that it will no longer countenance any threat to its national existence and interests.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nIt is not difficult to express admiration for China\u2019s amazing achievement and tenacity if we could momentarily close our eyes to the icy arrogance and cynical use of oppressive power that seem to accompany its phenomenal rise. One element of global influence that China appears to have neglected to cultivate is soft power\u2014the ability to shape attitudes in the long term.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nIn its bid to assert its newfound capacities in different areas, China has exhibited the ways of a bully impatient for recognition\u2014such as the ready use of brute force to secure submission when remunerative power does not work. The US does this, too, but it always tries hard to mask its aggression with ideals.

REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon\nTOKYO \u2014 Japan on Saturday became the fifth country to put a\nspacecraft on the moon\nbut the probe was not generating solar power, its space agency said, during a mission to prove a \u201cprecision\u201d landing technology and revitalise a space programme that has suffered setbacks.\nThe Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) said its Smart Lander for Investigating Moon (SLIM) landed the moon\u2019s surface at around 12:20 a.m. (1520 GMT Friday) and re-established communication with earth, but its solar panels were not able to generate electricity, possibly because they are angled wrong.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\n\u201cSLIM is now operating only on its battery, and we are prioritising the transfer of its data onto earth\u201d, Hitoshi Kuninaka, the head of JAXA\u2019s space lab, told a press conference.\nFEATURED STORIES\nNEWSINFO\nBar exam 2024: List of successful examinees\nNEWSINFO\n3 schools have highest percentage of passers among first-time bar exam takers\nNEWSINFO\nHouse panel: Ex-president Duterte center of grand criminal enterprise\nDubbed the \u201cmoon sniper\u201d, SLIM attempted to land within 100 metres (328 feet) of its target, versus the conventional accuracy of several kilometres, a technology JAXA says will become a powerful tool in future exploration of hilly moon poles seen as a potential source of oxygen, fuel and water.\nIt will take up to a month to verify whether SLIM had achieved the high-precision goals, JAXA has said.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nJapan is increasingly looking to play a bigger role in space, partnering with ally the United States to counter China. Japan is also home to several private-sector space startups and the JAXA aims to send an astronaut to the moon as part of NASA\u2019s Artemis program in the next few years.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nREAD:&nbsp;\nJapan flight returns to airport with cockpit window crack; no injuries\nBut the Japanese space agency has recently faced multiple setbacks in rocket development, including the launch failure in March of its new flagship rocket H3 that was meant to match cost-competitiveness against commercial rocket providers like SpaceX.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThe failure caused widespread delays in Japan\u2019s space missions, including SLIM and a joint lunar exploration with India, which in August made a historic touchdown on the moon\u2019s south pole with its Chandrayaan-3 probe.\nJAXA has twice landed on small asteroids, but unlike with an asteroid landing, the moon\u2019s gravity means the lander cannot pull up for another try, its scientists said. Three lunar missions by Japanese startup ispace, Russia\u2019s space agency and American company Astrobotic have failed in the past year.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nOnly four nations \u2013 the former Soviet Union, the United States, China and India \u2013 and no private company have achieved a soft landing on the moon\u2019s surface.\nThe 2.4m by 1.7m by 2.7m (7ft x 6ft x 9ft) vehicle includes two main engines and 12 thrusters, surrounded by solar cells, antennas, radar and cameras. Keeping it lightweight was another objective of the project, as Japan aims to carry out more frequent missions in the future by reducing launch costs. SLIM weighed 700 kg (1,540 lb) at launch, less than half of India\u2019s Chandrayaan-3.\nAs the probe descended onto the surface, it was designed to recognise where it was flying by matching its camera\u2019s images with existing satellite photos of the moon. This \u201cvision-based navigation\u201d enables a precise touchdown, JAXA has said.\nShock absorbers make contact with the lunar surface in what JAXA calls new \u201ctwo-step landing\u201d method \u2013 the rear parts touch the ground first, then the entire body gently collapses forward and stabilizes.\nOn landing, SLIM successfully deployed two mini-probes \u2013 a hopping vehicle as big as a microwave oven and a baseball-sized wheeled rover \u2013 that would have taken pictures of the spacecraft, JAXA said. Tech giant Sony Group, toymaker Tomy and several Japanese universities jointly developed the robots.\nYour subscription could not be saved.

Nowadays, it\u2019s becoming more expensive due to rising maintenance and insurance costs.&nbsp;\nThe United States has been deploying autonomous vehicles for ride-hailing services, such as Waymo.\nTesla CEO Elon Musk even promised his upcoming robotaxis will let their owners earn passive income.&nbsp;\nHe claimed they\u2019ll ferry passengers while their owners are busy so that they can earn money.\nHowever, artificial intelligence needs further improvement before self-driving cars become a major part of the global economy.\n3. Financial services\nFree stock photo from Unsplash\nMore apps are deploying AI investment and financial advisors to deliver more personalized recommendations.&nbsp;\nFor example, Google says AI can study customer journeys, peer interactions, and financial goals to suggest financial products and services.&nbsp;\nMany apps have been providing such services, but they\u2019ve become more convenient due to Large language models (LLMs).\nThese AI models allow these mobile programs to understand natural language, letting users describe their needs as if speaking with a real person.&nbsp;\nThey can also analyze documents to help financial institutions find investment opportunities and offer more suitable loans to clients.&nbsp;\nNonetheless, more consumer trust and stronger regulations are necessary to integrate AI into the financial sector safely and effectively.\n4. Retail and consumer\nFree stock photo from Unsplash\nAI-powered recommendations are also present in online shopping apps.&nbsp;\nNowadays, artificial intelligence allows these programs to push products and services that likely meet shoppers\u2019 demands.\nAs a result, the platforms earn more and consumers receive better customer service.&nbsp;\nThese technologies may also guide online businesses to improve their offerings after analyzing consumer trends.\nBusinesses can create AI-generated mockups to test products and services before pushing them to market. Consequently, it could reduce waste from product development.\nFor example, this Inquirer Tech\narticle\nreported a Filipino student who created stunning AI-generated dresses based on local myths.\nUS-based online shopping cloud platform SellersCommerce says over 33% of the world\u2019s population shops online.&nbsp;\nAs a result, AI\u2019s impact on eCommerce will inevitably affect the global economy.\n5. Technology, communications, and entertainment\nFree stock photo from Unsplash\nArtificial intelligence is making it easier to recommend the most suitable content to viewers.&nbsp;\nThis strategy is now common in online platforms like YouTube and TikTok. Moreover, AI helps these platforms organize content and monitor revenue generation.\nThis benefit trickles down to content creators, who use AI-assisted insights to provide more content that appeals to their audiences.&nbsp;\nSouth Korea takes this to the next level by creating online performers with artificial intelligence.\nThis\narticle\nexplains how tech company Pulse9 created the first-ever AI-generated K-pop group, Eternity.\n6.

AI systems could adapt to production changes, letting owners predict and control their outputs.&nbsp;\nConsequently, artificial intelligence could reduce costly delays, defects, or deviations from product specifications.&nbsp;\nThe AI boom has also caused countries to develop proprietary AI systems, which the tech giant Nvidia calls \u201csovereign AI.\u201d&nbsp;\nNvidia defines it as \u201ca nation\u2019s capabilities to produce artificial intelligence using its own infrastructure, data, workforce, and business networks.\u201d\nLearn more about this AI race\nhere\n.\n7.

Consequently, companies are investing in various sources that could meet this demand.&nbsp;\nFor example, Google signed an agreement with Kairos Power. It will develop small nuclear reactors and then Google will purchase their energy output.&nbsp;\nLearn more about this collaboration\nhere\n.\n8.

In this interview, Chef Cza, who recently won the 2024 Mansmith Young Market Masters Awards (YMMA), shares with us her approach to market-driving strategy, product innovation and building a strong consumer brand.\nQuestion: What inspired you to choose avocado as the central ingredient for your product line, and how did you identify the market potential for avocado-based products?\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nAnswer: Avocado is my favorite fruit, and I\u2019ve always been amazed by its versatility and health benefits. In the Philippines, however, I noticed a significant lack of demand for avocados, leaving our local avocado farmers underappreciated. I identified the market potential by observing growing global trends toward healthier, plant-based foods and recognizing that there was an opportunity to elevate our farmers while meeting consumer demand for nutritious options. By engaging with potential customers and conducting informal surveys, I saw a genuine interest in healthy, avocado-based products that could fill the gap in the local market.\nFEATURED STORIES\nBUSINESS\nMore foreign brands seen coming to PH shores in 2025\nBUSINESS\nGlobal Dominion: Simplifying financing to empower every Filipino\nBUSINESS\nInternational group kicks off infrastructure investment drive for PH\nQ: Avocados were traditionally seen as a seasonal product. How have you managed to mitigate supply risk to ensure consistent availability year round?\nA: To ensure a steady supply of avocados throughout the year, we\u2019ve formed strong partnerships with local farmers as well as with the leading supplier. This collaboration allows us to source avocados directly from farmers, ensuring freshness while supporting local agriculture. We also implement careful planning and forecast demand, which helps us coordinate harvesting and distribution effectively, even during off seasons.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nQ: What challenges did you face in shifting consumer perceptions around avocado-based products, and how did you overcome them?\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nA: One of the main challenges was addressing misconceptions about avocado-based products, particularly the concerns surrounding organic ingredients and preservatives. To overcome this, we focused on transparency in our marketing. We shared the story of our sourcing process and highlighted that our products are 100-percent organic and free from preservatives. Engaging content on social media\u2014such as behind-the-scenes looks at our production and interactive discussions\u2014has helped educate our audience and build trust in our brand.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nREAD:\nPH sends maiden shipment of hass avocados to Japan\nQ: What has been your most popular product, and why do you think it resonates so well with your customers?\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nA: Our most popular product is the \u201cAvocado Lover\u201d dessert. It features a base of avocado ice cream paired with tapioca pearls, homemade biscuits and topped with mixed seeds, homemade condensed milk and fresh avocado chunks. This unique combination creates an explosion of flavors and textures that customers adore. I believe its success is due to the harmony of its ingredients and the innovative take on a classic dessert, which has captured the hearts\u2014and taste buds\u2014of many.\nQ: Avocadoria\u2019s offerings are unique in the market. How do you stay ahead of trends and continue to innovate in the food and beverage industry?\nA: At Avocadoria, we prioritize staying ahead of market trends through continuous research and development. By monitoring consumer preferences, emerging health trends and food innovations, we are able to adapt and refine our offerings. We also encourage feedback from our customers, which fuels our creativity and helps us understand what they want. This commitment to innovation ensures that we remain a leader in the avocado-based product space.\nQ: As a YMMA awardee, what advice do you have for aspiring food entrepreneurs who want to turn a passion into a scalable business?\nA: My advice would be to focus on three key areas:\nQuality: Ensure that your product or service stands out in terms of quality and offers something unique that isn\u2019t readily available in the market. Passion should drive innovation and the continual improvement of your offering.\nUnderstand the market: Conduct thorough market research to understand your target audience, competition and industry trends. This will allow you to position your product effectively and tailor your marketing strategies to reach your potential customers more effectively.\nPlan for scalability: This includes efficient production methods, scalable distribution channels and a flexible business model that can adapt to changes in the market or customer preferences.\nQ: How do you see Avocadoria growing in the next few years, and what\u2019s next for the brand?\nA: I envision Avocadoria experiencing significant growth in the coming years, with plans for international expansion. Our goal is to attract more master franchisees, allowing us to share our love for avocados on a global scale. Ultimately, I aspire for Avocadoria to be recognized as the premier avocado brand from the Philippines, showcasing the richness of our local produce and the creativity of our avocado-made product offerings to the world.\n\u2014Contributed&nbsp;\nYour subscription could not be saved.

It was also larger than the previous month\u2019s ratio of 3.47 percent, data showed.\nFEATURED STORIES\nBUSINESS\nMore foreign brands seen coming to PH shores in 2025\nBUSINESS\nGlobal Dominion: Simplifying financing to empower every Filipino\nBUSINESS\nInternational group kicks off infrastructure investment drive for PH\nREAD:&nbsp;\nPH banks see lower bad debts in 2024\nIn peso terms, this means P524.31 billion out of the P14.55 trillion loan book of the entire local banking industry as of October had soured. That amount of NPLs was 16.66 percent higher compared with a year ago.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nAs it is, the proportion of bad debts held by banks has yet to return to the prepandemic level of 2.04 percent recorded at the end of 2019.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nLeonardo Lanzona, economist at Ateneo De Manila University, said the higher NPL ratio in October might have been a result of banks\u2019 \u201caggressive\u201d lending strategy amid the ongoing easing cycle of the BSP, which potentially increased their exposure to \u201crisky\u201d borrowers.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\n\u201dAs interest in loans became cheaper, lenders may have provided loans without robust risk assessments, thus resulting in lending to borrowers with low creditworthiness,\u201d he said.\nAt present, the benchmark rate that banks typically use as a guide when charging interest on loans stood at 6 percent following two quarter-point cuts each at the last August and October meetings of the Monetary Board. And a third reduction is likely on the table this month after the economy posted weaker-than-expected growth in the third quarter.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nBut beyond the rate cuts, Lanzona also said the powerful typhoons that hit the country in October and affected livelihoods might have made debt servicing more difficult for some borrowers.\nTo shield their balance sheets from credit losses, BSP figures showed banks set aside P487.52 billion as a provision for unpaid loans in October. That brought the NPL coverage ratio \u2014 a measure of the sufficiency of such buffer funds \u2014 at 92.98 percent, albeit lower than the 93.31 percent recorded in September.\nYour subscription could not be saved.

        "content": "Make America Great Again! (MAGA)\u201d\nSo goes the campaign slogan of reelected United States President Donald Trump. Interestingly, it isn\u2019t all that original since a similar one was used back in 1965 by then Sen. Ferdinand E. Marcos Sr. during his successful march to his first term as Philippine president.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nWith Trump\u2019s imminent assumption of office, the air is rife with speculations on how he would actually translate his campaign slogan into reality via specific programs, legislative proposals, and foreign policy. From the thrust of statements he\u2019s been making, it seems he intends to effect major structural policy and even sociopolitical changes on both the domestic and foreign affairs fronts. I will leave it to others to discuss sociopolitical matters, as those are more peculiar to American societal interaction that many others are more familiar with.\nFEATURED STORIES\nOPINION\nUrgent action needed vs online piracy as Congress session nears end\nOPINION\nLife has shortened\nOPINION\nThe gift of second chances\nSuffice it for me to observe, at the risk of being simplistic, that he appears determined to restore \u201ctraditional values,\u201d and put the brakes on the forward march of progressive liberalism particularly its so called \u201cwoke\u201d fringe. Somewhat associated with these are two of his highest priorities: securing US borders from the recent surge of illegal migrants, and rebalancing (as he sees it) the country\u2019s energy sector development strategy from a rapid headlong plunge into renewable energy dependence, toward a somewhat more gradual transition to that goal by restoring fossil fuel exploration, or as he puts it, \u201cDrill baby, drill.\u201d\nOn the domestic economic front, his game plan appears aimed at restoring dynamic economic growth by tax cuts and reduced government regulation. This, he hopes, would energize the private sector and put more disposable income in the pockets of the middle and working class, entrepreneurs, and corporations, thus creating jobs and hopefully, a virtuous cycle of higher employment rates that would broaden the tax base and generate a more positive budget outcome to meet the pressing financing needs of, among others, modernizing the country\u2019s infrastructure.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThe downside to this strategy is that the effect of tax cuts has a lag time during which already serious fiscal deficits may grow, resulting in even greater temptation to print money that will end up fueling inflation and escalating the level of national debt that even now threatens to become unmanageable. This latter vicious cycle outcome Trump hopes to stem by serious cuts in expenditure.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nSuch cuts appear to depend mainly on a draconian review of \u201cwasteful government expenditures\u201d by the envisioned new Department of Government Efficiency led by Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy. This involves the surgical trimming of perceived bloated bureaucracy in such agencies as the departments of education and of defense, and defense expenditure itself. The US defense budget is 10 times that of the next 10 countries in the world combined as it maintains 750 military bases in 80 countries.

At the very least, a US economy averting pneumonia will help stabilize the value of the peso and continue the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas\u2019 already optimistic scenario of progressively lowering interest rates. There are also signs that the US is more interested in an investment-oriented, rather than a China-containment, policy with us, such that Musk is reportedly eyeing the Philippines as a significant center for his expanded Asian business operations.

        "content": "Universal Health Coverage (UHC) Day, observed annually on Dec. 12, serves as a global reminder to champion health for all. UHC aims to ensure that all individuals and communities receive the health services they need, whenever and wherever they are needed, without suffering financial hardship.\nWhile Republic Act No. 11223, or the Universal Health Care Act, encompasses a wide range of health services\u2014from preventive to palliative care\u2014it is crucial to recognize health promotion as a fundamental component to sustain this.\nHealth promotion, a strategy that prevents illness and addresses underlying social factors that make people sick, remains underutilized. Beyond improving health literacy and individual behavior through awareness and communication, it involves crafting and implementing policies and programs that promote healthy practices and discourage harmful ones. For instance, taxes on unhealthy products like tobacco and alcohol have been proven effective in reducing consumption and preventing related health issues.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nLast November, the Health Promotion Program at the University of the Philippines National Institutes of Health (NIH), alongside representatives from nine other Asian countries, was invited by the ThaiHealth Foundation to join a conference showcasing Thailand\u2019s transformative journey toward sustainable health as underpinned by robust health promotion interventions. Thailand\u2019s model demonstrates that UHC and health promotion require a multisectoral approach involving government, the private sector, and civil society.\nFEATURED STORIES\nOPINION\nUrgent action needed vs online piracy as Congress session nears end\nOPINION\nLife has shortened\nOPINION\nThe gift of second chances\nAt the heart of Thailand\u2019s strategy are community-centric initiatives that tailor health promotion activities to local needs and contexts. More importantly, Thailand\u2019s globally recognized success is rooted in evidence-informed policies and programs that rely on research to answer critical issues on the best approach, effectivity, and possible improvements needed.\nThailand\u2019s commitment to using research to determine effective strategies, evaluate outcomes, and refine approaches for maximum impact is a key lesson. By focusing on root causes rather than symptoms, Thailand has shown the power of data-driven solutions.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nIn the Philippines, the UHC law has increased recognition of health promotion as a vital public health intervention. This is evident in expanded health promotion activities and investments at national and local levels guided by the Department of Health\u2019s Health Promotion Framework Strategy. However, challenges persist in the health promotion ecosystem, including limited resources, fragmented efforts, and weak integration with broader public policies.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThe Philippines can learn from Thailand\u2019s best practices in leveraging health promotion and disease prevention as foundational elements of UHC. Similar to Thailand, the DOH in collaboration with UP NIH, has established the Health Promotion Program to strengthen the generation of evidence.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nA key consideration for the future is fostering stronger collaboration among stakeholders to implement health-in-all policies. The Philippines can draw inspiration from ThaiHealth Foundation\u2019s role in guiding the government, the private sector, and communities toward health promotion goals driven by rigorous local evidence.\nHealth doesn\u2019t begin in a health clinic; it starts where people live, work, and play. While the tools are at our disposal, strong government and societal support are essential to turn them into action.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThailand\u2019s model offers valuable insights on integrating health promotion into the UHC framework and emphasizing evidence-based decision-making. By adapting these strategies to the local context, the Philippines can significantly advance toward UHC goals. It\u2019s time to prioritize health promotion as a core pillar of our health system, and not merely a supplementary strategy.\n(Disclaimer: The views expressed here are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the official policy or position of UP-NIH).\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\nYour subscription could not be saved.

Even roads leading to ramps leading toalso congested&nbsp; Skyway are no exception.&nbsp; &nbsp;These routes become impassable, turning commutes that should take mere minutes into hours-long odysseys filled with frustration and despair for those simply trying to get home from work or to family gatherings.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThe Manila Metropolitan Development Authority (MMDA), the agency entrusted with maintaining order on these vital \u201cNational\u201d roadways, seems utterly helpless against the escalating congestion. Their traffic operations are increasingly ineffective, with an evident lack of urgent response to a systemic problem that escalates every day. The failings do not stop there; local government units (LGUs) demonstrate a similar limbo of incompetence when it comes to control of flows in their management of secondary and tertiary roads where alternate routes should exist. Instead, motorist frustration rises as these designated alternatives become just as crammed as main roads due to an obvious lack of coordination and traffic management.\nFEATURED STORIES\nOPINION\nUrgent action needed vs online piracy as Congress session nears end\nOPINION\nLife has shortened\nOPINION\nThe gift of second chances\nPerhaps the most appalling sight is observed post-5 PM. As the sun begins to set, the commitment of MMDA enforcers evaporates, leaving weary commuters to fend for themselves in navigating the madness alone. This is intolerable and indicates the ineffective deployment of their resources during peak periods. This inconsistency breeds frustration and undermines public trust in our traffic management authorities. For instance, having a strategy to deploy additional personnel during heavy shopping seasons or critical events\u2014like Christmas\u2014particularly during \u201cnighttime\u201d. should be a no-brainer. Is it a problem of compensation and lack of funding? &nbsp;Whatever, their &nbsp;failure to deploy and serve the people on the road only suggests that an organization such as MMDA is clearly unprepared to execute its basic mandate.\nEven the Philippine National Police\u2019s traffic policemen seem absent when collisions occur, slow to respond to disputes and significantly hampered in their efforts to clear bottlenecks.&nbsp;\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nAlso, we must pressure local government units to re-examine their traffic flow strategies. Is there effective synchronization of traffic lights? Are secondary roads being utilized properly to divert traffic where necessary? Their local CCTVs can assist in swift identification of jams and prompt law enforcement actions.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThis pervasive problem goes beyond just traffic\u2014it signals a substantial failure in governance and urban planning. What makes matters worse is the apparent disdain of our authorities, who repeatedly promised solutions but provide no visible improvements. This relentless decline in mobility exasperates already congested lives, showcasing a clear disconnect between public sentiment and the bureaucratic response to the growing crisis.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThe effect of this traffic nightmare cascades through society. People arrive late for work, school, and essential appointments. School children miss classes, businesses lose revenue due to delayed deliveries, and the psychological strain on citizens is palpable. It is not merely an inconvenience; it\u2019s a detrimental blight on the quality of life that residents should rightfully expect. This inefficiency robs productivity and negatively impacts mental health, further pushing the narrative that we are living in a city nonchalantly overseen by mismanagement and neglect.\nAs we march into another holiday season, sparked with joy and wonder, imagine our retail establishments overwhelmed as customers flock to secure gifts and gather provisions. Yet, instead of unfettered access, they are met with gridlock; shopping frenzy quickly turn into vehicular purgatory, mirroring the frustrations felt year after year.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nWhat exacerbates this situation further is the prevailing lack of long-term strategic plans from our leaders. Where are the innovative solutions to improve public transport?\nIt is high time that the Philippine government acknowledges this dire predicament and acts decisively to address it\u2014not just with temporary fixes, but with sustainable solutions that will redefine urban mobility in Metro Manila.\nUrgent measures must be implemented. Moreover, decisive action should be taken against violators clogging the flow, improving, and enforcing regulations that prioritize public transport systems. What has happened to the non-contact apprehension laws that still pends in the Supreme Court?\nThis article isn\u2019t meant simply to lament over the state of traffic; it seeks to ignite a flame of urgency and purpose in saving Metro Manila from its present chaotic urban labyrinth.&nbsp; &nbsp;As we inch closer to the long-awaited Christmas season\u2014often associated with joy, family, and celebration\u2014let us also stir a collective movement towards a future where we are no longer prisoners of congestion.\nLet us make noise to push MMDA chairman Atty Romando Artes and PNP-HPG chief\nPB Gen William Sagun into creative action in solving this ongoing \u201cCarmageddon\u201d or \u201cCarpocalypse\u201d in all of our \u201cNational\u201d roads such as EDSA, C5 and others.&nbsp; Let us make noise so that the Metro Manila council headed by San Juan Mayor Francis Zamora, and every city mayor would task their respective LGU traffic enforcers to manage and solve the congested flows in \u201csecondary\u201d and \u201ctertiary\u201d roads, which are essentially their jurisdiction and prime responsibility.\nYour subscription could not be saved.

Velarde, chair of the Asian Institute of Journalism and Communication at Malaca\u00f1ang Palace on Friday. The \u201cmother of all Philippine maps\u201d has been cited as key evidence of the Philippine claims to the waters and other maritime features in the West Philippine Sea. \u2014Marianne Bermudez\nMANILA, Philippines \u2014 President Marcos could order the deployment of Philippine warships as a new policy option to respond to China\u2019s use of its own navy in its increasing aggression in the West Philippine Sea, but that decision is solely up to the Commander in Chief, a senior Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) officer said on Saturday.\nPCG spokesperson for the West Philippine Sea Commodore Jay Tarriela pointed out that the deployment of the People\u2019s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) ships \u201cwas now becoming part of the strategy of China in asserting their position in the West Philippine Sea,\u201d waters within the country\u2019s 370-kilometer exclusive economic zone (EEZ).\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nREAD:\nChina\u2019s PLA Navy shadows Philippine Coast Guard in West Philippine Sea\nFEATURED STORIES\nWWW\nLIVE UPDATES: Bar exam results 2024\nWWW\nTeodoro says petitions to cancel candidacy \u2018political maneuvering\u2019\nWWW\nLabor group seeks suspension of ballot printing for 2025 polls\nHe said that the deployment of Philippine warships \u201ccould be considered a reciprocal act\u201d since China was already doing it. Such a move is \u201cdependent on the Armed Forces of the Philippines on how they would like to come up with policy recommendation to strengthen our position in the West Philippine Sea,\u201d Tarriela said in a news forum.\n\u201cNow, if the question is if China is now deploying warships there, isn\u2019t it about time for us to deploy warships too?\u201d he asked.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\n\u201cI\u2019m not suggesting that we just deploy for the purpose of deploying warships,\u201d Tarriela said. \u201cWhat I said is it\u2019s up to the Commander in Chief and Armed Forces of the Philippines to come up with a policy recommendation to have the reciprocity of deployment.\u201d\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThe Philippines currently deploys \u201cwhite hulls,\u201d or coast guard vessels, not naval ships, for patrols and to perform law enforcement and other tasks in the West Philippine Sea to avoid militarizing the area.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThis policy has been in place since June 2012, when a Philippine Navy ship attempted to apprehend Chinese fishermen on eight vessels involved in digging up giant clams and corals and catching sharks illegally at Panatag (Scarborough) Shoal. They were blocked by other Chinese vessels until a two-month standoff eventually ended with China taking control of the atoll.\nThe Philippines maintains that is also adhering to the 2002 Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea between China and members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean), where they agreed not to escalate their maritime conflicts.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nChina lays sweeping claims to the South China Sea and has overlapping maritime claims with the Philippines, Vietnam, Brunei, and Malaysia.\nShadowing\n\u201cThe utilization of white ship in the West Philippine Sea is not something that President Marcos decided on his own. This has been our stand for the past three administrations already as a result of the 2012 standoff,\u201d Tarriela stressed.\nHis remarks followed the Dec. 4 shadowing of PCG vessels by Chinese PLAN near Panatag, also called Bajo de Masinloc. National Maritime Council spokesperson Alexander Lopez said it was the \u201cfirst time (they) came quite near and participated in the blocking or aggressive movements\u201d against PCG vessels.\nThe Chinese warship closely shadowed BRP Teresa Magbanua from a distance of only 270 meters while it attempted to approach a Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR) vessel.\nSideswiped\nAlso on the same day, a China Coast Guard (CCG) ship harassed the BRP Melchora Aquino, BRP Cape Enga\u00f1o, and the BFAR vessels that were deployed at Escoda (Sabina) Shoal. A CCG vessel with bow No. 3302 sideswiped BFAR\u2019s Datu Pagbuaya and fired its water cannon at it while it was conducting a routine patrol and delivering supplies to Filipino fishermen in the area.\nFormal protest\nThe Philippines filed a formal diplomatic protest against the Chinese actions.\nThe United States, the Philippines\u2019 treaty ally, and other countries also condemned China.\n\u201cThe PRC\u2019s (People\u2019s Republic of China) unlawful use of water cannons and dangerous maneuvers disrupted a Philippine maritime operation on December 4, putting lives at risk,\u201d American Ambassador MaryKay Carlson said in a statement on X.\n\u201cWe condemn these actions and stand with our like-minded friends, partners, and allies in support of a [Free and open Indo-Pacific],\u201d she said.\n\u2018No legal basis\u2019\nThe European Union, United Kingdom, Japan, France, Canada and Australia also expressed their concerns.\n\u201cWe oppose any threat of use of force contrary to international law and recall the importance of resolving disputes through dialogue. We recall the decision rendered by the Arbitral Court on July 12, 2016,\u201d the French Embassy in Manila said.\nThe 2016 arbitral award upheld Manila\u2019s sovereign rights to its EEZ in the western region, which includes Bajo de Masinloc, and rejected China\u2019s expansionist claim over the South China Sea for having \u201cno legal basis\u201d in international law.\nThe Chinese Embassy in Manila on Friday blasted the United States and its allies for expressing support to the Philippines, calling Carlson and the other countries \u201ctroublemakers to the peace and stability of the South China Sea.\u201d\n\u2018No right to interfere\u2019\n\u201cThe US Ambassador to the Philippines overlooked basic facts and made groundless accusations against China\u2019s legitimate measures for protecting its territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests.

With the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in November 2023, anyone involved with the LGBTQ+ community could be imprisoned for up to six years.\nAs a result, many left the country.

(Associated Press Photo/Evgeny Feldman, File)\nTargeting nightclubs, rainbow flags, and gay tourism\nJust days after the Supreme Court ruling, the LGBTQ+ community was rattled by news of police raiding gay bars, nightclubs and venues that hosted drag shows in Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities.\nLast spring, the first criminal case on charges of involvement with the \u201cLGBT movement\u201d extremist group was lodged against the owner and the staff of a bar in the southwestern city of Orenburg that held drag performances. A handful of similar cases came elsewhere.\nCharges have been launched for displaying symbols such as a rainbow flag \u2013 even though many of those accused had nothing to do with the LGBTQ+ community, said human rights lawyer Max Olenichev.\nMore raids of bars and nightclubs were reported in Moscow last month, almost exactly a year since the Supreme Court ruling. State media quoted law enforcement as saying they targeted those spreading \u201cLGBT propaganda.\u201d\nREAD:\nRussian LGBTQ+ museum closes after new law bans \u2018gay propaganda\u2019\nOne man arrested for allegedly running a travel agency for gay customers faces charges of organizing activities of an extremist organization.

He also approved legislation outlawing the spread of material that encourages people not to have children.\n\u201cAll this, in general, speaks more about the desire of the authorities to create some kind of atmosphere of fear. It\u2019s not repressions, it\u2019s terror,\u201d said Vladimir, an LGBTQ+ rights advocate in Russia who like many interviewed by AP asked to be identified only by a first name out of security concerns.\nIkar, a fellow activist and transgender man, described the actions by authorities as \u201can attempt to intimidate \u2026 to make people lose their social connections, stay silent, stay home.\u201d\nGoing underground, online or abroad\nVladimir and Ikar belong to an underground LGBTQ+ rights group that offers legal aid and holds offline events without fanfare. Activists thoroughly verify identities of anyone seeking its help.\nThe group is seeing a growing number of cases related to violence against LGBTQ+ people, Vladimir said.\nSome regional organizations have shut down completely; others operate openly, but in a drastically different way. The Moscow Community Center for LGBT+ Initiatives moved its community-building efforts into a sprawling online network of chats and Zoom meeting rooms, according to Baranova.\n\u201cOur strategy today is to preserve the community in some form and size at least, for the people to just know each other, support each other,\u201d she said.\nCenter T, a prominent trans rights group, closed its Moscow shelter after visits from police and opened one in Yerevan, Armenia, said group leader Yan Dvorkin. Center T helps emigres as well as those still in Russia to find doctors and medical care, trying to resolve crises and still be a part of a community, if only online.\nAnna, a 25-year-old transgender woman in Moscow, said being part of the community provided the courage to transition. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine what it\u2019s like for new people, who are only opening up the possibility for themselves,\u201d she said.\nAnna transitioned and came out to her family and friends last year, after the ban on gender-affirming care was enacted.\nFILE PHOTO: Gay rights activists hold a banner reading \u201cHomophobia \u2013 the religion of bullies\u201d during a protest on Red Square in Moscow on July 14, 2013.

Access to gender-affirming medical care is a major issue, with doctors wary of working with transgender people and with many turning to shoddy underground medications.\nViolence against transgender people has spiked, as has harassment and discrimination, Dvorkin said.\n\u201cNowadays, you can intimidate people \u2013 blackmail them \u2013 by (saying) that \u2018I will report you and you will go to prison for extremism,\u2019\u201d the activist said.\nThose who stay in Russia, despite the risks\nAnna considers herself lucky and \u201cprivileged.\u201d She has a well-paying job, can afford a doctor advising her from abroad on hormonal therapy, and can get the medicine in Moscow. She wouldn\u2019t elaborate on how and where she gets it, so authorities \u201cdon\u2019t pull the plug.\u201d\nBut she said she hasn\u2019t come out to her colleagues for fear of losing her job, and she is sometimes harassed on the street because of her appearance. Her identity documents can\u2019t be changed under the ban.\nShe says she has a support network of friends and doesn\u2019t want to leave Russia, even though she\u2019s acutely aware of the risks.\n\u201cI somehow have managed to adapt,\u201d she said. \u201cI know how to live here.\u201d\nYulia, another transgender woman, also vowed to stay, describing it as sort of a mission to show that \u201cpeople like me are not necessarily weak, are not necessarily useless.\u201d\nIn her mid-40s, Yulia has a family and children, a successful career in a male-dominated industry, and the respect and acceptance from her colleagues and friends. For her, \u201cit\u2019s about normalizing\u201d being trans, she said.\nHow much \u201cnormalizing\u201d is possible in the current climate and the years ahead is still an open question.\nThe\nban on \u201cpropaganda of nontraditional sexual relations\u201d\nforces print, TV, and movie censorship of LGBTQ+ relations. In a recent example, two Russian streaming services cut a transgender character from the 1990 drama series \u201cTwin Peaks.\u201d\nAt the same time, there is abundant official rhetoric from politicians, the Russian Orthodox clergy and media figures condemning LGBTQ+ people.\nMany like Gela Gogishvili, the gay man who fled Russia last year, worry about the next generation of LGBTQ+ people.\nHe said he\u2019s \u201ceven more scared for those who are born there and are currently growing up -\u2013 from their childhood years onwards, they will be taught that (being queer) is bad.\u201d\nYour subscription could not be saved.

Associated Press\nCAPE TOWN, South Africa \u2014 President Joe Biden is finally making his long-promised visit to Africa this week, attempting to showcase a U.S.-backed railway project in three countries that he has pushed as a new approach in countering some of China\u2019s global influence.\nBiden\u2019s first visit to the continent as president \u2014 which he left to the very end \u2014 will highlight the Lobito Corridor railway redevelopment in Zambia, Congo and Angola. It aims to advance U.S. presence in a region rich in the critical minerals used in batteries for electric vehicles, electronic devices and clean energy technologies.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThat\u2019s a key field for U.S.-China competition and China has a stranglehold on Africa\u2019s critical minerals.\nFEATURED STORIES\nGLOBALNATION\nPCG: China using AIS spoofing to mislead public and stir confusion\nGLOBALNATION\nPH asserts rights over Bajo de Masinloc at UN General Assembly\nGLOBALNATION\n'Aid for Kristine-hit Batangas': Presidential assistance for farmers, fisherfolk, families\nA new strategy\nThe U.S. has for years built relations in Africa through trade, security and humanitarian aid.

The trip was kicked back to 2024 and delayed again this October because of Hurricane Milton, reinforcing a sentiment among Africans that their continent is still low priority. The last U.S. president to visit was Barack Obama in 2015.\n\u201cAfrica never gets top attention,\u201d said Witney Schniedman, an expert on African economic growth at the nonprofit Brookings Institution.\nBut many are optimistic that the Lobito project, which isn\u2019t due for completion until well after Biden has left office, will survive a change of administration and be given a chance. It goes some way to blunting China, which has bipartisan backing and is high on Trump\u2019s to-do list.\n\u201cAs long as they keep labeling Lobito one of the main anti-China tools in Africa, there is a certain likelihood that it\u2019s going to keep being funded,\u201d said Christian-G\u00e9raud Neema, who analyzes China-Africa relations.\nSome success in Africa\nThe Lobito Corridor will be an upgrade and extension of a railway line from the copper and cobalt mines of northern Zambia and southern Congo to Angola\u2019s Atlantic Ocean port of Lobito, a route west for Africa\u2019s critical minerals.\nIt\u2019s little more than a starting point for the U.S. and its partners, because China is dominant in the mining in Zambia and Congo. Congo has more than 70% of the world\u2019s cobalt, most of which is heading to China to reinforce its critical mineral supply chain that the U.S. and Europe have to rely on.\nLobito was made possible by some American diplomatic success in Angola that led to a Western consortium winning the bid for the project in 2022 ahead of Chinese competition, a surprise given Angola\u2019s long and strong ties with Beijing. China financed a previous redevelopment of the railway.\nThe Biden administration accelerated American outreach to Angola, turning around what was an antagonistic relationship three decades ago when the U.S. armed anti-government rebels in Angola\u2019s civil war. U.S.-Angola trade was $1.77 billion last year, while the U.S. has a stronger stake in regional security through a strategic presence on the Atlantic Ocean, and Angolan President Jo\u00e3o Louren\u00e7o\u2019s role mediating in a conflict in eastern Congo.\nIn Angola, Biden will announce new developments on health, agribusiness, security cooperation as well as the Lobito Corridor, White House officials said on a preview call with reporters.\nThe visit, the first by a sitting U.S. president to Angola, will \u201chighlight that remarkable evolution of the U.S.-Angola relationship,\u201d Frances Brown, a special assistant to the president and senior director for African affairs at the National Security Council, said on a separate call.\nIt will also draw attention to a perennial challenge for America\u2019s value-based diplomacy in Africa. International rights groups have used Biden\u2019s trip to criticize the Louren\u00e7o government\u2019s authoritarian shift. Political opponents have been imprisoned and allegedly tortured, while security and other laws have been passed in Angola that severely restrict freedoms, throwing some scrutiny on Washington\u2019s new African partnership.\nWill the US really show up?\nThose calling for more U.S. presence in Africa say Angola and the Lobito spinoff show what might be achieved, even with China-facing countries, if the U.S. is willing to consistently engage. But they see signs for Africa when China has held a summit with African leaders every three years since 2000, while the US has had just two summits, in 2014 and 2022, and there are no plans for the next one.\nMichelle Gavin, a former U.S. ambassador to Botswana and adviser on Africa to Obama, said that the U.S. had failed to take Africa seriously over multiple administrations, a bipartisan trend. She doesn\u2019t see Biden\u2019s visit and Lobito being a major \u201cinflection point\u201d that will drive a new U.S. focus across Africa.\nYour subscription could not be saved.

        "content": "ILLUSTRATION BY RUTH MACAPAGAL\nBesides being the founder and global group chair of my worldwide strategy and management consulting company, I have also been a graduate executive MBA professor for more than 13 years. I know that many of the most important keys to success are not taught at business school. One of them is how to create a great network.\nGrowing up in a small town in Germany, my family didn\u2019t have much. We weren\u2019t wealthy, and money was a constant concern. I wasn\u2019t born with a silver spoon or a vast network. Instead, I built my global network from scratch. Now I am regularly interacting with or advising heads of state, Nobel laureates, Fortune 500 CEOs, some of the world\u2019s wealthiest business owners and many of the world\u2019s most famous business leaders. How did I pull that off? My journey taught me that\u2014besides expertise and unique skills\u2014reputation and trust are the most important.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThe foundation of success: Reputation and trust\nAll of the clients of my global strategy and management consulting company go through a due diligence process and background checks before we take them on. We are in the fortunate position that we can choose who to work with and regularly turn requests away.\nFEATURED STORIES\nBUSINESS\nMore foreign brands seen coming to PH shores in 2025\nBUSINESS\nGlobal Dominion: Simplifying financing to empower every Filipino\nBUSINESS\nInternational group kicks off infrastructure investment drive for PH\nRecently, we discovered that one of our new prospects, a family business owner, despite maintaining a good public reputation, has questionable ethical standards. This individual has a pattern of engaging in unethical practices whenever he believes he can get away with it, disregarding clear agreements.\nIn business, your reputation is your most valuable asset. It precedes you in every room, opening doors that would otherwise remain closed. Trust is the currency of this reputation. It\u2019s what turns introductions into partnerships and handshake deals into long-term relationships.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nA handshake should carry the same weight as a signed contract, and a verbal agreement should be as binding as one certified by lawyers. For instance, a family business we work with, which has thrived for 55 years and serves hundreds of millions of consumers worldwide, entrusts us with its most confidential financial details without even requiring a nondisclosure agreement. This level of trust demonstrates that reputation and integrity form the backbone of business relationships.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nEthics as a competitive edge\nEthical behavior in business is often viewed as a moral responsibility, but its practical benefits cannot be overstated. High ethical standards are not just about adhering to laws or regulations; they serve as a unique competitive edge in the marketplace. Companies and leaders known for their integrity attract top-tier talent, loyal customers and trustworthy business partners. These stakeholders are more likely to invest their time, energy and resources in organizations they perceive as ethical and dependable.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nA strong commitment to ethics creates a culture of accountability and transparency within the organization. Employees feel safe and empowered when they work for a leader who values honesty over shortcuts. This sense of trust fosters innovation, collaboration and long-term employee retention. For example, one of our long-standing clients\u2014a multigenerational family business\u2014has continuously expanded into new markets while maintaining an impeccable reputation for ethical dealings. This reputation has not only attracted lucrative partnerships but also positioned the business as a trusted leader in its industry, ensuring its sustainability over decades.\nMoreover, ethical behavior often translates into better decision-making. Leaders who prioritize long-term relationships and sustainable growth over immediate profits avoid the pitfalls of hasty, ill-conceived decisions. They cultivate trust within their ecosystems, which acts as a buffer in times of crisis. Ethical businesses are less likely to face reputational damage or costly legal battles, giving them a competitive advantage over peers who choose to cut corners.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nLessons from the fallen\nHistory is littered with examples of leaders and companies brought to their knees by unethical behavior. These cautionary tales highlight that success achieved through dishonesty is rarely sustainable and that the costs of unethical decisions often far outweigh their short-term benefits.\nConsider the downfall of Enron, a company once hailed as one of America\u2019s most innovative enterprises. Its executives engaged in fraudulent accounting practices, inflating profits to maintain investor confidence. When the truth emerged, Enron filed for bankruptcy, erasing thousands of jobs and wiping out billions in shareholder value.\nAnother example is the Volkswagen emissions scandal. The company deliberately installed software in millions of cars to cheat emissions tests, allowing it to market vehicles as environmentally friendly when they were anything but. The scandal cost Volkswagen billions in fines, lawsuits and vehicle recalls, and it severely damaged brand reputation. Rebuilding that trust has been a long and arduous journey for Volkswagen, underscoring the heavy price of unethical shortcuts.\nThese cases demonstrate that the ripple effects of unethical decisions extend far beyond financial loss. They destroy careers, tarnish reputations and leave organizations struggling to regain public trust. For leaders, the takeaway is clear: shortcuts in ethics may provide temporary gains, but they often lead to irreversible damage.\nThe fragility of success\nSuccess in business is fragile. Most companies are only one or two major strategic decisions away from total failure. A lapse in ethical judgment can be one such misstep, with far-reaching consequences. It\u2019s crucial to maintain high ethical standards, even when faced with challenging decisions.\nLeaders who cut corners or bend the rules often rationalize their actions by assuming no one will notice. However, word spreads quickly in the business community. When trust is eroded, opportunities disappear, and partnerships dissolve. Worse, leaders who operate unethically may not realize the damage until it\u2019s too late, as few are willing to confront them directly.\nThe ripple effect of leadership\nUnethical behavior at the top doesn\u2019t stay contained; it trickles down through the organization. As the leader, your actions set the tone for your company culture. If you compromise on ethics, it sends a message that dishonesty and cutting corners are acceptable. This behavior can lead to a toxic environment where employees feel justified in bending the rules.\nOn the flip side, leaders who uphold integrity inspire their teams to do the same. Ethical leadership fosters a culture of accountability, transparency and mutual respect, which in turn drives innovation and growth.\nFive to thrive\n\u2022 Prioritize integrity in\nevery decision\n\u2022 Cultivate a culture of trust\n\u2022 Invest in long-term relationships\n\u2022 Learn from failures in ethics\n\u2022 Implement ethical accountability systems INQ\nYour subscription could not be saved.

(Photo from Jiji Press)\nAn increasing number of Japanese companies operating in China are transferring their production bases to countries in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean).\nThis comes as Chinese economic growth slows and concerns rise over the risks of doing business in China, where foreign residents have been arrested on vague grounds.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThe Chinese economy is stagnating, and this can clearly be seen in production, consumption and investments. The country\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) for the second quarter (April-June) of 2024 grew 4.7% year over year, which was 0.6 points lower than the first quarter (January-March). Economic data from August shows that retail business sales, an indicator of consumption trends, grew only 2.1% year over year.\nFEATURED STORIES\nBUSINESS\nMore foreign brands seen coming to PH shores in 2025\nBUSINESS\nGlobal Dominion: Simplifying financing to empower every Filipino\nBUSINESS\nInternational group kicks off infrastructure investment drive for PH\nREAD:\nPH, US, Japan agree vs \u2018economic coercion\u2019\nThe slump in the real estate industry is a major factor behind this. The real estate market and related industries make up a fourth of China\u2019s GDP, but investments in real estate development fell 10.2% year over year in the period between January and August 2024.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, China implemented a \u201cZero-COVID Strategy,\u201d which kept citizens indoors, dealt a major blow to the tourism and restaurant industries, and led to investments being concentrated in real estate. Home prices rose exponentially.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nIn response, the Chinese government placed heavy restrictions on risky deals. This caused home prices to drop drastically, and the businesses of many major real estate developers declined. Down payments were made, but buildings never got built, and as similar cases followed one after another, the consumption trend cooled among the population.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nFurthermore, the Chinese government, which places utmost importance on national security, established the Counter Espionage Law in 2014. This has resulted in many foreigners, including Japanese, being arrested for \u201cespionage acts,\u201d which are only vaguely defined.\nStarting in July 2024, new regulations have been implemented that allow authorities to inspect the contents of electronic devices of individuals and organizations for acts of espionage, raising further concerns that even regular economic activities could be scrutinized. With little hope for significant growth in the Chinese market, coupled with the risks of doing business in China, direct international investments into the country fell 29.1% year over year between January and June 2024. There are also other issues, such as the risk of high tariffs on products produced in China and exported to the USA due to the ongoing tension between the two countries, as well as rising labor costs in China.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nAgainst this backdrop, Japanese companies are turning their eyes to Southeast Asia for new bases of production. In January 2023, Sony transferred the manufacturing of its cameras for Japan, Europe and the USA from China to Thailand. Its factories in China now only make products to be sold domestically, allowing it to reduce dependency on the country.\nKyocera also plans to transfer a part of its electric tool production in China to Vietnam in fiscal 2024. The Vietnam site will mainly manufacture products to be sold in the USA to avoid the tariffs placed on exports from China.\nAccording to Teikoku Databank, the number of Japanese companies operating in China decreased from 14,394 in 2012 to 13,034 in 2023. Many companies are choosing to relocate back to Japan or Southeast Asia. This can be seen in how Southeast Asian countries now occupy three of the top five locations in terms of the number of Japanese companies\u2019 overseas subsidiaries: No. 1 is China, followed by USA, Thailand, Singapore, and Vietnam.\nREAD:\nMore Asean nations offer help on South China Sea issue\nSoutheast Asia is attractive in many ways for Japanese companies. Not only is it geographically close to Japan but it also offers a rich pool of human resources with technical prowess and fluency in many languages including English, which allows companies to secure a stable labor force. Many Asean countries also have highly transparent fiscal policies and stable currency exchange rates. Cities have established solid infrastructure such as electrical power and transportation networks, making it easier for companies to build factories there and secure supply chains, from production and distribution to sales.\nThe Southeast Asian market is very appealing. The 10 Asean countries have a combined population of around 670 million people. It tops the population of the European Union (EU), which is around 450 million people and is the third largest in the world after India and China. The median age is also young, and unlike many developed nations, the region has not yet been faced with the issue of an aging society with a low birthrate.\nThe 2023 nominal GDP of the 10 Asean countries combined rose to around 3.81 trillion US dollars, which ranks right after the USA, China, Germany and Japan. It is forecast to overtake Japan\u2019s GDP by 2030. Due to the effects of an aging population and low birthrate, there are concerns that Japan\u2019s market and labor force will shrink going forward. Japanese companies will benefit greatly from operating and expanding their businesses in Southeast Asia, which has a large market, offers rich human resources and is referred to as \u201cthe world\u2019s growth center.\u201d\nForeign ministers of Asean, Japan, China and South Korea. (Photo by Jiji Press)\nJapan and Asean countries have established various cooperative partnerships in politics, foreign policy and the economy. Japan is an active participant in numerous Asean foreign policy and security frameworks, including the East Asia Summit (EAS), which started in Malaysia in 2005, Asean Regional Forum (ARF), which discusses political and security issues, and Asean Defense Ministers\u2019 Meeting Plus (ADMM-Plus), the only formal meeting of defense ministers in the Asia-Pacific region. In 2020, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) was officially signed, including Japan, China, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand in addition to Asean. Building an open economic sphere by providing market access and establishing economic rules is accelerating active free trade, including small and medium-sized businesses.\nWhile Southeast Asia is attractive to Japan, Japan must also be attractive to Southeast Asia. Southeast Asian company managers often say that decision-making is slow in Japanese businesses. They say this is due to a uniquely Japanese custom where multiple meetings are needed to make a single decision, and everyone has to then wait for it to be approved by the head office in Japan. Furthermore, Southeast Asians who grew up loving Japanese brands and anime are already in their 40s and 50s, while the attention of the younger generation, which is driving consumption, has been turning to South Korean and Chinese cultures as well. As such, greater efforts must be made to ensure that Southeast Asia will choose Japan as a partner.\nLast year, Japan and Asean celebrated their 50th anniversary of cooperative partnerships. The relationship, in fact, began as one of animosity. Japan drew the ire of Southeast Asia by exporting massive quantities of cheap synthetic rubber to Asean, a producer of natural rubber, and that led to the holding of the Asean-Japan forum on synthetic rubber in 1973.\nYour subscription could not be saved.

It was a perfect example of the proverb \u201cAfter rain comes fair weather.\u201d One could call 2024 the first year of the next half-century of new cooperative partnerships. Going forward, Japan\u2019s efforts will determine how strong this partnership with Asean will become.\nREAD NEXT\nSafe manufacturer investing P1.5B for Pampanga plant\nShareholders\u2019 agreement\nEDITORS' PICK\nFilipino film \u2018Haligi\u2019 considered for Golden Globes\nP40 per kilo rice now available in more public markets\nClimate change intensified back-to-back PH storms \u2013 study\nDOH: Undiagnosed HIV cases contribute to spread of virus\n2 PH enterprises recognized as Asia's best innovators\nSOCIAL CLIMATE: Life has shortened\nMOST READ\nComelec exempts 48 projects from election ban\nLorraine Badoy after red-tagging civil suit loss: \u2018Fight isn\u2019t over\u2019\nBar exam 2024: List of successful examinees\n3 schools have highest percentage of passers among first-time bar exam takers\nFollow\n@FMangosingINQ\non Twitter\n-->\nView comments",

        "content": "Illustration by Ruth Macapagal`\nToday the old adage \u201cchange is the only constant\u201d has never rung truer. As the founder of a global strategy and management consulting firm, I recently encountered a financial services giant that starkly illustrated a critical pitfall facing large organizations today\u2014the peril of bureaucratic rigidity.\nWhen my team and I engaged with this behemoth, we were met with an organization so entrenched in its ways, so beholden to outdated processes, that it was clear they were on a trajectory toward obsolescence. Despite their size, their inability to adapt swiftly to market changes made us question whether our efforts could truly effect the necessary transformation.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThis encounter is not unique. Many large organizations fall into the trap of becoming slaves to their own processes. What starts as a framework to ensure efficiency and consistency morphs into a monolithic barrier to innovation and agility. This rigidity can be fatal, particularly in an era where flexibility and speed often trump sheer scale.\nFEATURED STORIES\nBUSINESS\nMore foreign brands seen coming to PH shores in 2025\nBUSINESS\nGlobal Dominion: Simplifying financing to empower every Filipino\nBUSINESS\nInternational group kicks off infrastructure investment drive for PH\nThe hidden cost of bureaucracy\nHistorically, we\u2019ve seen giants topple due to their inability to adapt. Kodak, for example, clung to traditional film while the world embraced digital photography. Similarly, Blockbuster failed to pivot in the face of streaming technology, allowing Netflix to revolutionize home entertainment.\nThe crux of the issue lies in a fundamental shift in the business environment. Economies of scale, once a significant advantage, are no longer the primary determinant of success. Today\u2019s winners are those who can pivot quickly, innovate constantly and remain agile in the face of change. Companies like Amazon, with its \u201cDay One\u201d mentality, exemplify this approach, constantly reinventing themselves to stay ahead.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThe cultural element of innovation vs. bureaucracy\nOne major advantage of my company being global is the diverse perspective we bring to each client. My team and I blend a broad, global outlook with an intimate understanding of local cultures. This unique combination allows us to frame problems and challenges within a proper global context, crafting solutions that elevate our clients to the next level with ease and speed.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nDifferent cultures around the world naturally foster either an innovation mindset or a bureaucratic one. The United States, for example, is renowned for its pragmatic, entrepreneurial approach, contributing to Silicon Valley\u2019s status as a global innovation hub. This region marries Californian playfulness with a business mindset, creating a fertile ground for tech giants.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nIn contrast, countries like Germany, Switzerland and some Southeast Asian nations such as the Philippines, lean towards bureaucratic tendencies, making it challenging for larger organizations to embrace agility.\nThe Middle East, though evolving with innovation hubs like Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Saudi Arabia, generally remains rooted in traditional corporate structures. However, these countries are now prioritizing innovation, with Oman serving as a contrasting example where traditional mindsets still contribute to bureaucratic tendencies.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nOur global insight, coupled with local expertise, empowers us to navigate these cultural nuances. We understand how an innovation-friendly environment can be a game-changer for our clients. By recognizing and adapting to these cultural differences, we can devise strategies that foster innovation and agility, propelling our clients toward success in a complex, interconnected world.\nExamples of successful turnarounds\nMy team and I have turned many slow dinosaurs into agile jaguars. If you know how, it is definitely possible. Companies can successfully rejuvenate themselves by embracing a startup mentality.\nThe global business landscape is full of many successful examples. For instance, Microsoft underwent a cultural shift under Satya Nadella\u2019s leadership, breaking down silos and fostering a more collaborative, innovative environment. Similarly, Ford revitalized its culture by focusing on transparency and lean decision-making, transforming from a legacy automaker into a more agile company.\nMy team and I have seen that even the most established organizations can avoid the pitfalls of bureaucracy with the right leadership and strategy. The key lies in fostering a culture that values speed, collaboration, and continuous innovation.\nA case study: Bureaucracy in action\nWe once had a client, a successful billionaire business owner, who envisioned a groundbreaking deal poised to catapult his company to new heights. However, as the proposal moved through various departments, the layers of bureaucracy began to distort the original vision. Each department added its own requirements and procedures, creating a complex web of red tape that deviated from the owner\u2019s intent. The deal, once promising, was on the brink of collapse due to this bureaucratic quagmire.\nIf you suspect that your company has fallen prey to the silent killer of bureaucracy, it\u2019s crucial to take decisive action. Begin by conducting a thorough audit of your processes to identify bottlenecks and redundancies. Encourage open communication across departments to ensure alignment with the company\u2019s core objectives. Empower employees to challenge inefficient practices and propose innovative solutions.\n\u200b\u200bSimilarly, Nokia offers another cautionary tale. Once a leader in mobile phones, Nokia failed to adapt quickly to the smartphone revolution, clinging to outdated systems and processes. This bureaucratic inertia allowed competitors like Apple and Samsung to overtake Nokia, which struggled to regain relevance.\nYour \u2018Five to Thrive\u2019\nIn the modern business environment, agility, not size, determines success. Bureaucracy can be a silent assassin, stifling the very dynamism that fuels growth. By prioritizing flexibility, empowering employees, and embracing innovation, business leaders can ensure their organizations not only survive but thrive in the long term.\nYour subscription could not be saved.

Here are five practical steps:\nPrioritize flexibility over rigidity. Foster a culture that values adaptability. Encourage employees at all levels to challenge the status quo and propose improvements.\nStreamline processes. Regularly review and refine workflows to eliminate redundancies. Keep structures lean to maintain agility.\nEmpower decision-making. Decentralize authority to enable faster responses. Train teams to make informed decisions without excessive oversight.\nEncourage innovation. Advocate for a fail-fast approach, where experimentation is rewarded, and learning from failures is part of the process. Encourage cross-functional collaboration to spark creative solutions.\nLeverage technology. Embrace new technologies to streamline operations and gain a competitive edge.

        "content": "SEOUL\u2014As Israel proceeds with a ground offensive against Hezbollah, the situation in the Middle East continues to deteriorate, with the prospects for ending the war dim, and the number of lives lost escalating. Absent this time is US intervention to manage the crisis. Has the international order led by the United States since the end of the Cold War collapsed?\nMost analyses, including that of New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman, have pierced the essence of the current Middle East conflict as a struggle between the \u201ccoalition of inclusion\u201d and the \u201ccoalition of resistance.\u201d But they overlook one crucial element: the importance of domestic politics.\nIn Israel, this centers on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who faces responsibility for failing to prevent last year\u2019s surprise attack by Hamas. Over 41,615 Palestinians, mostly civilians, have died in Gaza due to Israeli military actions, adding to his burden. Israel, once seen as a victim of the Holocaust, is now increasingly viewed as a perpetrator of war crimes.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nNetanyahu also faces legal issues related to corruption charges. Given these circumstances, he may feel the need to secure an image of overwhelming victory to push for an end to the war. Otherwise, a conclusion to the war could signal the beginning of him being found legally or politically accountable. Thus, it\u2019s natural to suspect that Israel\u2019s provocative military actions against Hamas, Iran and Hezbollah may be driven more by Netanyahu\u2019s personal political interests than by the broader struggle between the teams of \u201cinclusion\u201d and \u201cresistance.\u201d\nFEATURED STORIES\nOPINION\nUrgent action needed vs online piracy as Congress session nears end\nOPINION\nLife has shortened\nOPINION\nThe gift of second chances\nIran\u2019s domestic politics show a different picture. Its missile attack toward Israel on Tuesday might be interpreted as a skillfully compromised operation. The attack comes belatedly as retaliation for the death of Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah, killed on Sept. 27, and of Ismail Haniyeh, the Hamas leader assassinated on July 31. The strike was more a show of force rather than angling for real damages because Iran is aware that most of the missiles would be intercepted by Israel\u2019s Iron Dome.\nIran\u2019s halfway response implies that Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, who is representing the reformists, has a voice in the decision-making process, and is trying to avoid a full-scale war with Israel and improve relations with the US.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nDomestic politics in the US also contribute to the situation in the Middle East, with the US\u2019 inability to act possibly influenced by the strong pro-Israel lobby within the country. However, the national security guidelines of its Indo-Pacific strategy might also be a significant factor. While this strategy aligns with the general American public\u2019s displeasure with China, it has led to a perception that issues in other areas are of secondary importance. As a result, misunderstandings about the US\u2019 global role have spread, leading to neglect in dealing with other regions.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThis neglect has erupted in various crises, such as Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and Israel\u2019s continued military operations. The Indo-Pacific strategy, which harms US hegemony and reputation, was a product of domestic political focus. After winning in 2016, then President Donald Trump boosted his popularity by noting that contradictions in the US economy and society stem from cheap Chinese products and illegal immigrants. As a result, China-bashing became a political trend no US politician could resist. Even the Biden administration had to adopt a foreign policy focused on checking China to survive in the domestic political arena.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nBy reconstructing the Middle East situation through the lens of domestic politics in the US, Israel and Iran, one can derive a somewhat different picture from Friedman\u2019s grand narrative that the clash between the \u201ccoalition of inclusion\u201d and \u201ccoalition of resistance\u201d is inevitable. The cohesion within both camps is weak, and painting Iran, Iraq, or Hezbollah as villains does not help, nor is it necessary to argue that eliminating them would connect the Asia-Pacific and Europe.\nWhile understanding the rivalry between Friedman\u2019s coalitions of inclusion and resistance is important for comprehending and resolving the Middle East crisis, it is equally critical to account for the changes, if not distortions, caused by domestic politics. This perspective allows us to urge the US to adopt and implement a global-scale strategy focusing on universal values and norms, rather than a China-centered regional response like the Indo-Pacific strategy.

        "content": "Wine Drop is on a mission to make more people drink wine. Their strategy? Make it more fun\n\u201cWe have a big crisis in wine globally. There\u2019s too much wine, and people are drinking less.\u201d\nWhen we met with Wine Drop\u2019s managing director Jean-Philippe Guillot, he dropped this sobering yet unfortunately long-standing fact. There has been a downward trend in wine consumption globally since 2018, and the most recent estimate by the\nInternational Organization of Vine and Wine\nnoted that 2023 consumption was the lowest volume they\u2019ve recorded since 1996.\nDespite the decreased\ndemand\nin European and Western wine-drinking countries (and even China), it\u2019s surprising to see that the wine market is actually growing in the Philippines.\nIn 2022, the country was noted to be one of the \u201cmost exciting wine markets,\u201d thanks to the continued increase in wine consumption here. However, there\u2019s still much work to be done.\nFor wine distributors like AWC, of which Wine Drop is under, tickling Filipinos\u2019 taste buds for wine is proving to be a reliable strategy.&nbsp;\nWine Drop is AWC\u2019s retail component, providing spaces for consumers to directly purchase, drink, and even learn more about the wines they carry.&nbsp;\nSince 2014, AWC has been known for supplying quality wine to some of the country\u2019s top hotels, resorts, and restaurants, such as the Shangri-la group, Grand Hyatt, Fairmont, Raffles, Dusit Thani as well as Solaire and Okada.\n\u201cWine was not really in the culture of the Philippines, so a lot of restaurants didn\u2019t really have a wine list. A lot of Filipinos are also traveling the world, and of course they get into wine more. So our first mission was really to bring good quality wine from around the globe and help restaurants\nbuild their wine list\n,\u201d Guillot says.\nBut after years of showcasing their wines at partner restaurants and online resellers, the group realized the need for a platform or space where customers could buy bottles directly. \u201cIt was a bit frustrating that there\u2019s no shop to showcase our wine for people. If they enjoyed [the] wine in a restaurant, they don\u2019t really know where to buy it for their home. So that was our first motivation, to have a place where people can find all the wine.\u201d\nThe pandemic also played a major role in AWC\u2019s decision to establish Wine Drop. \u201cBecause most of our customers were hotels and restaurants and they were all closed during COVID, we had a lot of stock of wine,\u201d Guillot says. Thus their website winedrop.life was created.\nSoon after, Wine Drop ventured into putting up a physical space in Greenhills. Guillot describes the neighborhood as one that is \u201cdynamic\u2026 with people who love F&amp;B.\u201d\nAfter a year in Greenhills, Wine Drop ventured into a second location, this time in Makati, along the strip of warehouses at Chino Roces Extension. The decision to open here came with two-fold benefits: As primarily a wine importer, having both a shop and a warehouse space was crucial. The warehouse, which they keep cold at a controlled temperature of 16 to 17 degrees every day, ensures that the wine they carry will maintain its quality.\n\u201cWine is a product that\u2019s still alive,\u201d Guillot says. \u201cIf you don\u2019t take care of it, it will turn into vinegar. That\u2019s not what it\u2019s supposed to be.\u201d\nFilipinos and wine\nWhile the Philippines is still not a major wine market, it is showing great promise especially in recent years. Guillot attributes this to the rapidly changing F&amp;B landscape in the country.\n\u201cFilipinos usually eat and then drink after. In France, you eat and drink at the same time. It\u2019s two different cultures. But when you look at these new fantastic restaurants opening with a new chef generation, when you look at all these new\nsommeliers\nor bartenders who have worked abroad and are coming back to the Philippines, they bring what they learned abroad. That\u2019s what makes Manila unique, I think, and very impressive in terms of new concepts,\u201d Guillot says.\n\u201cThis new generation of Filipinos are so passionate about wine,\u201d he says. \u201cI know a lot of them, and their passion is wine, to taste wine. I think you have this big dynamic market where people enjoy going out and drinking good stuff as well.\u201d\nJean-Philippe Guillot\nAmong the wines that has been in Wine Drop\u2019s rotation the longest is this wine from Chateau Cap de Fer.\nWith this growing interest in wine, Wine Drop\u2019s mission is to further cultivate that interest.&nbsp;\n\u201cWine could sound intimidating for some people. Not everyone\u2019s going to go to a five-star hotel [to drink wine], and when you open the wine list, it\u2019s very hard to choose,\u201d Guillot says. \u201cAt Wine Drop, we wanted to have a nice place that\u2019s engaging and easy to come in. The idea of Wine Drop is really to make a wine shop that is accessible.\u201d\nAt the Makati shop, the wines are classified by taste profile, instead of price or country of origin. Their featured wines come in a wide range of prices, the cheapest bottles falling below P1,000, with the most expensive ones priced at around P20,000. But with taste as the priority at Wine Drop, customers can browse the shelves themselves, ranging from light, medium, and heavy reds to light and crisp and even acidic whites.\nAround 75 percent of the shop\u2019s selection are red wines, as Filipinos mostly prefer red wines.\nREAD:\nA natural wine education by way of three new bars\nAll members of Wine Drop\u2019s shop staff are also knowledgeable about wines, happily providing recommendations based on customer preferences.\nGuillot himself is very hands-on, having sourced nearly 80 percent of their wine selection. Being born in a winemaking family, Guillot has long been connected to winemakers from various countries. At Wine Drop, he shares, the goal is to really push for the wines by family-owned wine companies, especially the ones he personally can vouch for.\n\u201cI like to work with friends and it\u2019s easier for me to sell it to you or to the F&amp;B director and say, this [wine is by] my friend. When I look at all the labels, I know all the winemakers, and I\u2019m very happy to be the messenger for them.\u201d\nIn the store, Wine Drop has also partnered with chefs whose dishes and products make up the shop\u2019s concise menu. \u201cWe\u2019re not a bar or a restaurant,\u201d Guillot emphasizes. What started as a basic platter of cold cuts and cheese to simply accompany the wines being showcased eventually grew. \u201cIt\u2019s not enough. When people come here, they want to taste the wine, [so] they need food. If you drink without eating, you know what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d Guillot laughs.\nFrench masterchef\nCyrille Soenen\nhelped develop the les plats canaille menu for Wine Drop. Les plats canaille, Guillot explains, are French dishes meant to be shared at the table. \u201cYou put it in a big pot, a bit like when you\u2019re with your family and friends, and you put it in the middle and share.\u201d\nCassoulet, a slow-cooked stew popular in France\nCold cuts and cheese. The cheese board features cheese from Malagos farm in Davao\nFrom Soenen\u2019s CiCou are appetizers like chicken liver and pork head p\u00e2t\u00e9, beetroot salmon gravlax, quiche, and a light but delectable fougasse pissaladi\u00e8re. Hot dishes like beef bourguignon, chicken confit, and cassoulet as well as desserts like kouign-amann and chocolate moelleux are also available.\nMeanwhile, Spanish chef Chele Gonzalez stocks Wine Drop with deli favorites like the New York style beef brisket pastrami and grilled octopus a la Gallega. Blackpig supplies the shop with eight-inch pizzas alongside tapas by Txanton. Amid global fare, an assortment of cheese by local farm Malagos can also be enjoyed with cold cuts.\n\u201cThe Philippines is making fantastic cheese. Even as a Frenchman, I\u2019m so happy and proud we\u2019re putting Philippine cheese on our selection,\u201d Guillot says.\nIn crafting the menu, Guillot emphasizes the meals\u2019 shareability and pairing with wine.&nbsp;\nWine pairing is one of Wine Drop\u2019s primary campaigns, both on social media and in their events. On Instagram, a number of videos highlight different wines paired with various dishes and cuisines. Their events and collaborations also emphasize how wine can be paired with a variety of dishes, from pizza to oysters.\nFougasse pissaladi\u00e8re\nMaking wine approachable\n\u201cThe idea of Wine Drop is to make it fun as well. I really want to make wine fun and more accessible in terms of price and in terms of knowledge for everyone,\u201d Guillot says. \u201cIt\u2019s very important that we are able to teach but in a fun way.\u201d&nbsp;\nTrue to this mission, Wine Drop regularly holds Wine 101 sessions, and even wine game nights, where guests can learn trivia about wine all while enjoying glasses themselves.\nAmong the shelves bearing various wines are books and even board games all about winemaking and drinking. An impressive red box, for example, opens up to dozens of vials, each one representing a key ingredient or scent profile you\u2019d likely find in a variety of wines. The board game helps train the nose to pick up the various notes.\nWhile Wine Drop organizes regular wine communes and trivia nights, guests can also enjoy a short, impromptu Wine 101 session at the shop. Everyone\u2019s a wine expert in the shop, Guillot says, so it\u2019s definitely easy to simply ask to know more about the wine you\u2019re drinking.\nWine flights are one way to better understand wines\nAnd when it comes down to it, Guillot recommends really just drinking more to develop one\u2019s taste for wine. \u201cIt\u2019s basic, but drink more wine. When you drink, always look at the label and try to get three main pieces of information: the country, the region, and the grape varietal. And when you drink, put a note on your phone, and if you come [to us] with a list of wines you like and don\u2019t like, we can tell you what you should get.\u201d\n\u201cAnd come to Wine Drop, go for dinner with six friends. Let\u2019s do a Wine 101. For 30 minutes, you learn, and after, you have a great evening here. So at least, you get drunk, but you get smarter.\u201d\nRead more",

        "content": "Rodrigo Duterte \u2014BING GONZALES\nMANILA, Philippines \u2014 Former President Rodrigo Duterte appears to be at the \u201ccenter\u201d of a \u201cgrand criminal enterprise\u201d to wage a brutal war on drugs to enable and to profit from the very same scourge he had openly and strongly campaigned to eliminate, according to a preliminary report on a monthslong House inquiry.\nAs it turned out, Duterte was \u201cthe face of illegal drugs and criminality\u201d in the country, Antipolo Rep. Romeo Acop said late Thursday, reading a report on the findings of the House quad committee on the links between Philippine offshore gaming operators (Pogos), illegal drugs and extrajudicial killings (EJKs) during the previous administration.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\n\u201cLadies and gentlemen, the quad comm has started to uncover a grand criminal enterprise, and it would seem that at the center of it is former President Duterte,\u201d Acop said. \u201cNapakasakit po nito dahil pawang tayo ay nabudol. (This is so painful because we were all scammed).\u201d\nFEATURED STORIES\nNEWSINFO\nBar exam 2024: List of successful examinees\nNEWSINFO\n3 schools have highest percentage of passers among first-time bar exam takers\nNEWSINFO\nHouse panel: Ex-president Duterte center of grand criminal enterprise\nAcierto revelations\nHe said that a former \u201cright-hand man\u201d of Duterte who had testified during one quad committee hearing, dismissed narcotics officer Eduardo Acierto, described the former chief executive as the \u201clord of all drug lords.\u201d\n\u201cNapakasakit po dahil (It\u2019s very painful because) Mr. Duterte won on a platform of a hardline stance against illegal drugs and criminality. Siya pala ang mukha ng illegal drugs at kriminalidad. (It turned out that he was after all the face of illegal drugs and criminality),\u201d said Acop, a retired police general who was chief of the Criminal Investigation and Detection Group.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nHe said the quad committee\u2019s job was difficult and that no one wanted to go up against a popular former president. But like Duterte, lawmakers were elected by the people and have a responsibility to them, he said.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\n\u201cKaya ipagpapatuloy po natin ang ating inquiry at sisguraduhin po naming aayusin ang ating mga batas upang masiguro na hindi na mauulit ang mga kaganapang ating natuklasan. (That\u2019s why we will continue our inquiry and make sure to fix our laws so that none of these things that we have discovered would be repeated),\u201d Acop said.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nSummary of findings\nHe laid down a summary of the quad committee\u2019s findings from its inquiry which opened in August with testimonies and documents presented by dozens of \u201cresource persons,\u201d including retired and active duty police officers, relatives and supporters of drug war victims, local and national officials, and Duterte himself.\nAcop reported that Duterte and his inner circle used the drug war as a cover for the so-called \u201cDavao Mafia\u201d to profit off the drug trade and eliminate its competition.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nDuterte, who appeared before the panel on Nov. 13, had denied these allegations but admitted that he did encourage police officers to carry out his drug war by all means necessary to eradicate the scourge.\nThe former president also said he assumed responsibility for everything that happened under his campaign. The police\u2019s official report said over 6,000 people were killed during Duterte\u2019s presidency, but human rights groups believed the number could reach as high as 30,000.\nOther testimonies\nIn addition to Acierto, Acop cited the testimonies of former Bureau of Customs (BOC) intelligence officer Jimmy Guban, ex-BOC broker Mark Taguba, former Senators Leila de Lima and Antonio Trillanes IV, and former Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office general manager and retired police officer Royina Garma. They all identified either Duterte or people close to him as having links to the drug trade or to the human rights violations that came with his drug war.\n\u201cEach of these individuals carried with them intimate knowledge of the inner workings of the drug trade in the Philippines\u2014and what do they have in common? They spoke out and revealed what was really happening in the drug war, and because of this, they all suffered and earned the ire of the president,\u201d Acop said.\nYang connection\nDuterte\u2019s close associates included his former economic adviser, Chinese businessman Michael Yang, whom Acierto and Guban alleged was a drug lord himself and who supposedly owned a meth lab in Dumoy, Davao City, which was raided by the authorities in 2004.\nThough this case is now 20 years old, the Dumoy raid came under renewed scrutiny after Duterte admitted in a recent interview that he \u201celiminated everybody who was involved,\u201d including six Chinese nationals.\nYang allegedly has links to illegal Pogos with his business partner Allan Lim (also known as Lin Weixiong) and his brother Antonio Yang.\nAcierto, Taguba and Guban also linked Yang, Duterte\u2019s son, Davao Rep. Paolo Duterte, and his son-in-law Manases Carpio, to two major drug smuggling cases in 2017 and 2018, which involved P6.4 billion and P3.4 billion worth of crystal methamphetamine (\u201cshabu\u201d), respectively. They said the drugs were smuggled through the Manila International Container Terminal.\n\u2018Tara\u2019 system\nThese shipments supposedly bypassed inspections through the \u201ctara\u201d system\u2014a deeply entrenched bribery scheme within the BOC where millions of pesos in grease money facilitated the unimpeded entry of drugs.\nAcierto was the first to blow the whistle on Yang and reported this to Duterte, Sen. Christopher \u201cBong\u201d Go, and Sen. Ronald \u201cBato\u201d dela Rosa, but he was ignored, the former police colonel said.\nAcierto fled the country after supposedly learning of a plot to assassinate him. He is one of the witnesses in the case against Duterte in the International Criminal Court.\nOne of the most explosive testimonies during the hearings came from Garma, who alleged that there was a rewards system that incentivized the killing of drug offenders by police officers and that this was patterned after the scheme implemented by Duterte in Davao City where he was mayor for over two decades.\nConfirmation\nFormer Albuera, Leyte, police chief Col. Jovie Espenido confirmed the existence of the rewards system in which police officers received up to P100,000 for each alleged drug offender killed. He said the reward was managed by Go, a former special assistant to the President, who allegedly used money from confidential funds and profits from Small Town Lottery. Go has strongly denied this.\n\u201cThe existence of the rewards system is not denied,\u201d Acop said. \u201cIn fact, pinagmayabang pa ito ni former President Duterte at ang kanyang mga alipores (former President Duterte and his cohorts even bragged about it).\u201d\nThis reward system led to countless EJKs and \u201cso many of them were collateral damage,\u201d Acop said.\nDuterte made many incriminating statements at the quad committee hearing, including admitting that he had killed \u201csix or seven\u201d \u201ccriminals\u201d when he was mayor.\nHe also recalled that he often patrolled the streets of Davao on his motorbike in hopes of catching criminals and killing them himself.\nBato: No surprise\nDela Rosa said he was not surprised by Acop\u2019s conclusions.\nThe senator, Duterte\u2019s first Philippine National Police chief and the first implementer of the drug war, insisted that the House quad committee\u2019s mission was to \u201cdestroy the Dutertes.\u201d\n\u201cWe launched the war on drugs not to enrich ourselves, but to save this republic from becoming a narco state and save the Filipinos, especially the youth, from the evils of illegal drugs,\u201d Dela Rosa told the Inquirer.\n\u201cWe did not deceive the people. I swear before the graves of my policemen who offered the ultimate sacrifice in the war on drugs,\u201d he said.\nPNP data\nPNP data from July 2016 to June 2022 showed that 312 officers were killed and 974 were injured in Duterte\u2019s drug war.\nThe initial findings of the megapanel composed of the committees on human rights, dangerous drugs, public order and safety, and public accounts, will be presented to the plenary on Dec. 17.\nYour subscription could not be saved.

Meanwhile, they will be working on the legislative measures they filed as part of the quad committee\u2019s output, including a bill that would specifically penalize EJKs, Barbers said.\n\u2014WITH REPORTS FROM MARLON RAMOS, PNA, AND INQUIRER RESEARCH\nREAD NEXT\nPagasa: Cloudy weather, rain still likely in parts of PH\nEnforce discount laws,&nbsp;commuters tell LTFRB\nEDITORS' PICK\nP40 per kilo rice now available in more public markets\nFilipino film \u2018Haligi\u2019 considered for Golden Globes\nSOCIAL CLIMATE: Life has shortened\nClimate change intensified back-to-back PH storms \u2013 study\nNegros Occidental declares state of calamity after Kanlaon blast\nGlow all out: Sparkly makeup to welcome the New Year\nMOST READ\nComelec exempts 48 projects from election ban\nLorraine Badoy after red-tagging civil suit loss: \u2018Fight isn\u2019t over\u2019\nBar exam 2024: List of successful examinees\n3 schools have highest percentage of passers among first-time bar exam takers\nFollow\n@FMangosingINQ\non Twitter\n-->\nView comments",

rates \u201cat the right time\u201d.\nThe annual Central Economic Work Conference was being closely watched for signs of more stimulus, though the announcement \u2014 which included stabilizing foreign trade and supporting the troubled property sector \u2014 was unable to boost sentiment.\nThe gathering came after Beijing began unveiling in September a raft of policies to reverse a growth slump that has gripped the economy for almost two years.\nJulian Evans-Pritchard of Capital Economics said it remained unclear how big a boost there would be, adding that, \u201cwhile we may get a near-term stimulus bounce, we\u2019re still not convinced that policy support will prevent the economy from slowing further next year\u201d.\nAnd strategists at Bank of America Global Research said:

following a three-day rebound from the selling sparked by South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol\u2019s brief martial law declaration, as the focus there turns to a second impeachment vote planned for Saturday.\nAll three main indexes in New York closed in the red, with investors taking to the sidelines ahead of the Fed\u2019s Wednesday gathering, when it is tipped to cut borrowing costs for the third time.\nHowever, there is growing concern that with inflation still above the bank\u2019s target \u2014 and president-elect Donald Trump pledging to cut taxes and impose tariffs \u2014 officials will not make as many next year as initially hoped.\n\u201cThere is a risk that inflationary pressures could change the central bank\u2019s plans,\u201d said Charu Chanana, chief investment strategist at Saxo Markets.\n\u201cRecent (consumer price index) reports show that inflation is still sticky, and if Trump\u2019s policies \u2014 like higher fiscal spending or tariffs \u2014 are enacted, inflation could re-accelerate.\n\u201cThis would give the Fed less room to ease, potentially leading to a hawkish surprise for markets.\u201d\nThe euro held around two-year lows after the European Central Bank cut rates and president Christine Lagarde warned the eurozone economy was \u201closing momentum\u201d, warning that \u201cthe risk of greater friction in global trade could weigh on euro

        "content": "FILE PHOTO: A Philippine offshore gaming operator (Pogo) hub operating behind the town hall of Bamban in Tarlac province has been shut down following a government raid in March 2024 due to human trafficking, online scams, and other illegal activities. INQUIRER/RICHARD A. REYES\nThe President\u2019s decision to ban Philippine offshore gaming operators (Pogos) has presented new challenges for the government, particularly the legal gaps related to managing assets such as buildings and lands confiscated from alleged criminal operations linked to these hubs.\nOver the past months, lawmakers and officials have proposed various uses for the idle properties, including converting them into evacuation centers, schools, or government offices.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nHowever, Justice Undersecretary Nicholas Ty, head of the Inter-Agency Council Against Trafficking (Iacat) established by law in 2012, highlighted one of the many concerns they faced: the need for immediate access to the resources seized from suspected scam hubs to support trafficking victims and Pogo employees rescued during raids.\nFEATURED STORIES\nGLOBALNATION\nPH asserts rights over Bajo de Masinloc at UN General Assembly\nGLOBALNATION\nPCG: China using AIS spoofing to mislead public and stir confusion\nGLOBALNATION\n'Aid for Kristine-hit Batangas': Presidential assistance for farmers, fisherfolk, families\n\u201c[There is] an absence of a clear provision that expressly empowers [the] state [to] provisionally use assets pending forfeiture, especially money that can be used to maintain victims and facilities,\u201d Ty told the Inquirer on Thursday.\nREAD:\nAuthorities raid Pogo hub in Bataan BPO company\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nAlthough the Anti-Financial Account Scamming Act signed in July 2024 addresses this matter, Ty noted that Iacat was still waiting for its implementing rules and regulations.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nIn the meantime, the government found a \u201ccreative solution\u201d\u2014\u201ccommandeering\u201d raided facilities and using them to house thousands of trafficking victims, he said.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nAccording to Iacat\u2019s records, over 3,000 Pogo employees have been rescued and \u201cpresumed to be victims of human trafficking.\u201d\n\u201cWe do not really have enough shelters to house these victims of trafficking, and if we do let them out, chances are they are just gonna be re-trafficked or revictimized in another scam hub,\u201d Ty said during a forum last Tuesday organized by the Stratbase ADR Institute.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nA comprehensive inventory of the total number of buildings, floor area, land area, and estimated value has not been published by the authorities following the raids on these hubs, notably those in Bamban, Tarlac, and Porac, Pampanga.\nThere has also been no disclosure of any plan by responsible government agencies to inspect these properties to determine whether they were suitable for classrooms, offices, medical facilities, evacuation centers, or other purposes while criminal and civil forfeiture cases are pending.\nNew Marcos warning\nLess than three weeks before his year-end deadline to shut down all Pogos in the country, which he announced in his State of the Nation Address in July, President Marcos warned that those who run \u201cguerrilla\u201d or rogue Pogo and internet gaming licensees (IGLs) after he had canceled all their licenses.\nMr. Marcos formalized the ban in November under Executive Order No. 74.\n\u201cWe will never let them wreak havoc on us again. Anyone who attempts to launch illegal operations will face the full force of our laws,\u201d the President said.\nHe posted his remarks on Facebook and Instagram on Wednesday night, after meeting with Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corp. (Pagcor) chair Alejandro Tengco, Presidential Anti-Organized Crime Commission (PAOCC) chief Gilbert Cruz, Interior Secretary Juan Victor \u201cJonvic\u201d Remulla and other government officials on winding down the operations of the remaining offshore gaming hubs.\nOn Thursday morning, the President ordered law enforcement agencies to carry out small but multiple operations against offshore gaming operators that were still running their businesses despite the ban.\nHe directed local officials to coordinate with the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) in going after Pogos and IGLs in their areas and ordered the DILG to step up gathering intelligence on the presence of Pogos in communities.\nCanceled licenses\nAccording to Malaca\u00f1ang, 53,700 Pogo licenses were canceled, while 18 IGLs voluntarily canceled theirs as of Nov. 29. By Dec. 31, all licenses will be deemed canceled, and the Philippines will supposedly be \u201cPogo-free\u201d by January 2025.\nIt said 353,000 visas had been issued to foreign workers for these gaming establishments. By the end of the Duterte administration, only 33,863 remained, and 23,099 of them recently left the country.\nMany more foreigners, mostly Chinese, entered the country as tourists and found jobs as Pogo workers, according to a Senate investigation of the pastillas scam. The total number of foreign workers working legally and illegally in Pogos could far exceed the number of legitimate employment visas issued by the government.\nDuring Tuesday\u2019s forum, Ty said that since Pogo hubs were usually one-stop shops, not just the offices but actual residences of the trafficking victims, the government used the facilities to temporarily house rescued workers there.\nHe said that under the Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act, \u201cproceeds of instruments of human trafficking can be forfeited in favor of Iacat for the benefit of victims of human trafficking.\u201d\nNo typical victim\nAnother significant legal challenge is \u201cvictim identification\u201d and \u201cforced criminality\u201d because many rescued individuals refuse to see themselves as trafficking victims, Ty said.\nHe said that human trafficking, often described as modern-day slavery, differs from past enslavement where victims were treated as property.\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s why it becomes even more complex in the victimology of the trafficking victims and the scam hubs. Because they are not, at least from the Philippine perspective, the typical trafficking victim who is from a very poor location who is mired in poverty, who is not that educated,\u201d he explained.\n\u201cThe victims of human trafficking, at least from the Philippines\u2014well, even from other countries\u2014they\u2019re usually college graduates from middle-income families. They\u2019re tech-savvy,\u201d Ty added.\nHe said the authorities will use other measures, such as anticorruption laws, to prosecute \u201cother enablers\u201d of human trafficking like government officials.\n\u2018Leakage\u2019 probe\nFor its part, the Supreme Court said it found no evidence linking members of the judiciary to the alleged \u201cleakage\u201d of information regarding the Porac raid last June.\nChief Justice Alexander Gesmundo on Wednesday told reporters that preliminary inquiries \u201cdid not get positive results\u201d and that judges and court staff were involved.\nWhen authorities raided the Pogo compound in Porac, the PAOCC found only 158 Chinese, Vietnamese, and Malaysians instead of the more than 1,000 individuals who were supposedly there at the time\u2014an indication that the operators had insider information about the raid.\nSen.

        "content": "Rewriting Philippine history is not exclusive to academics. Politicians indulge in it too, when they name or rename the streets that define us. Take Arsenio H. Lacson street, named after the feisty mayor of Manila who served from 1952-1962, that connects Sampaloc to Nagtahan and Pandacan.\nPeople born in the last century, like me, remember it as \u201cPor-Bes,\u201d named after William Cameron Forbes who served as the United States governor general from 1909-1913. But Forbes has not been completely erased from the landscape because of Forbes Park in Makati. While Forbes Park remains the premiere gated community in the country, its reputation is far from aspirational in some sectors. Taipan Lucio Tan used to refer to it, in jest, as \u201cPobres Park,\u201d referring to the number of mortgaged, hard-to-sell properties, in the enclave.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nForbes came to mind recently when I went on a tour of \u201cMansion House,\u201d the official summer residence of American governors general and later Philippine presidents. Many years ago, I thought aloud, \u201cIsn\u2019t Mansion House redundant? Aba! Mansion na, House pa?\u201d I was glad when the giant Instagrammable sign on its lawn declared, \u201cThe Mansion.\u201d\nFEATURED STORIES\nOPINION\nUrgent action needed vs online piracy as Congress session nears end\nOPINION\nLife has shortened\nOPINION\nThe gift of second chances\nWhile grammatically correct and tighter to an editor\u2019s eye, I found that Forbes had a vacation home in the US called \u201cMansion House.\u201d From a 1907 publication, I learned that Mansion House was built on the highest site in Baguio, and that Governor Forbes\u2019 summer residence was called \u201cTopside.\u201d\nI had never been inside Mansion House and always saw it from outside its elegant wrought iron gate. It is open to the public now, thanks to the initiative of First Lady Liza A. Marcos, as a museum of Philippine presidents and the presidency. You can register for a tour slot online, but none were available and we were only in Baguio for two nights, so we tried our luck as \u201cwalk-in\u201d patrons. Being seniors must have helped because everywhere we went, the young staff were courteous and attentive. This is a welcome change from being made to wait or asked to return another day at government offices.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nAfter registration, where ID details were taken down and a contact number requested, we boarded a golf cart that took us up the long driveway where we were met and told to catch up with the 9 a.m. tour group. We were reminded that photography is prohibited in the exhibit halls, a policy that has to be relaxed because there is so much historical data on the walls. Interested patrons should be allowed to take pictures not just of the wall texts, but the few presidential memorabilia on display.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThe first room was an introduction to Mansion House and Baguio. Archival photographs brought visitors back to the time when it was a colonial hill station. One must remember that in an age without air-conditioning, the heavyweight first civil governor William Howard Taft suffered in Manila\u2019s heat. Baguio as a \u201csummer capital\u201d was just that: in the hot months, the whole government transferred and operated there. This explains why we have Cabinet Hill with cottages for all department secretaries. Teachers Camp was for training, meetings, as well as rest and recreation. Today, only the Supreme Court comes up for summer sessions.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nFrom the first room, one proceeds along a narrow hall lined with portraits of all the First Ladies of the Philippines, from Hilaria Aguinaldo to Liza Marcos. While students are introduced to the sequence of Philippine presidents in Araling Panlipunan, first ladies are only remembered by the bright ones who compete in quiz bees. The list goes: Hilaria Aguinaldo, Aurora Quezon, Paciencia Laurel, Esperanza Osme\u00f1a, Trinidad Roxas, Victoria Quirino (not a spouse but a daughter because Elpidio Quirino was a widower), Luz Magsaysay, Leonila Garcia, Eva Macapagal, Imelda Marcos, Amelita Ramos, Loi Ejercito, Jose Miguel Arroyo (the only thorn among the proverbial roses because the President was a woman), and Liza Marcos. There were three vacancies: Corazon Aquino was a widow and her son Benigno S. Aquino III was a bachelor so they both went solo and did not designate a person to fill the role. With Rodrigo Duterte, it was complicated, no one was designated.\nThe rest of the galleries cover each president from Aguinaldo to Marcos Jr. Wall texts provide: biographical details, term of office, significant achievements, a portrait, quotable quote, and a facsimile signature. In vitrines are photographs and memorabilia. Our tour guide showed public history in practice, making each president human in her spiel. My only problem was that in the timeline for Ferdinand E. Marcos Sr., there was no reference to the 1986 people power that led to his \u201cexile.\u201d Since Feb. 25 and Aug. 21 remain holidays under the second Marcos administration, curators should have taken the cue and simply stated fact instead of inviting criticism through a glaring omission.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013\nComments are welcome at aocampo@ateneo.edu\nYour subscription could not be saved.

        "content": "Indonesia\u2014Since their invention in the early 20th century, plastics have been omnipresent in our daily life, and have become a global choice due to their durability, flexibility, and low production cost. Industries ranging from food to electronics have been relying for decades on plastics, their primary material for product packaging. Plastic serves as protection, marketing and information tool, and a convenient way to transport products. For optimal performance, plastic is often combined with other materials, making it difficult to recycle.\nDespite the ample benefits, plastic\u2019s versatility may pose risks to health and the environment. Since the 1950s, plastic consumption has surged, reaching 400.3 million tons in global production in 2022 alone, much of them for single-use packaging to preserve food and protect fragile items.\nBut environmental alarms are sounding. Researcher Hannah Ritchie and colleagues estimate that 0.5 percent of plastics end up in the ocean, harming marine ecosystems. Traces of plastic also pollute mountains, forests, and waterways.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nTo deal with the problem, businesses and governments have been showing a stronger commitment. The fifth Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee (INC-5) on Plastic Pollution from Nov. 25 to Dec. 1 in Busan, South Korea, was meant to draft an international legally binding instrument to tackle the plastic pollution problem.\nFEATURED STORIES\nOPINION\nUrgent action needed vs online piracy as Congress session nears end\nOPINION\nLife has shortened\nOPINION\nThe gift of second chances\nThe momentum is building as over 260 businesses, from multinationals to local enterprises, have joined the Business Coalition for a Global Plastics Treaty (BCGPT), urging governments at INC-5 to adopt an ambitious, full-lifecycle plastics treaty. This collective effort also aims to foster awareness, innovation, and a sustainable ecosystem with the prospect of global regulations under a treaty.\nIndustry has also been exploring solutions like optimizing and harmonizing packaging (Reduce), reusable packaging, and design for recycling. It has also been increasing recycled content along with developing bioplastics and paper-based options to reduce virgin plastic use. These innovations require comprehensive life cycle assessments and suitable waste management for bio-based plastics to ensure sustainable impact.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nAs well, food and beverage packaging must meet strict safety and compliance standards to protect consumers. Key guidelines include Food and Drug Monitoring Agency Regulation No. 20/2019, and international standards like those from the United States Food and Drug Administration, the European Medicines Agency, and the European Food Safety Authority, detailing permitted, limited, and banned substances. Additionally, packaging should be environmentally safe, functional, competitively priced, and of high quality.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nLeading producers of fast-moving consumer goods have also optimized packaging size, increased recycled content and used easier-to-recycle materials. They\u2019ve introduced reusable designs and innovations as well, like paper straws.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nBut are these alternatives enough to address the plastic crisis?\nRecycling is important, but not enough. In fact, less than 10 percent of plastic waste is currently recycled globally. The remaining waste often ends up being incinerated in landfills.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThen there\u2019s the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) program, which requires companies to manage their products\u2019 end-of-life, which is now gaining traction, especially in developed countries with advanced waste management. However, for EPR to be effective globally, stronger waste management systems are essential, particularly in developing countries where they remain inadequate and poorly managed, leading to high rates of plastic leakage into rivers and oceans.\nI\u2019d strongly suggest maximizing our efforts for waste collection, waste segregation, and building the infrastructure to process related waste. We must ensure greater quantity and better quality feedstock for secondary raw materials to increase the recycling rate and recycled content. For packaging, we can work on nonfood contact material if the food contact material is not yet available.\nWe also need stricter but more conducive regulations to prevent plastic leakage and to promote and encourage the use of sustainable materials, given the higher costs incurred when industry switches to easy-to-recycle materials or to recycled-content materials. Waste management systems should not create new problems, such as improper disposal of hazardous byproducts.\nThe plastic crisis requires multiple solutions. Global rules can unify multi-stakeholder efforts to phase out problematic plastics, but consumer behavior change is also essential. Now is the time to advocate for stronger regulations, better waste management, and a collective shift in consumption and production. Plastics were considered a \u201cmiracle\u201d when they were first introduced for packaging. They now pose challenges and are perceived as a symbol of unsustainability.\nIt is time to rethink our relationship with plastics for the sake of the planet.

        "content": "Make America Great Again! (MAGA)\u201d\nSo goes the campaign slogan of reelected United States President Donald Trump. Interestingly, it isn\u2019t all that original since a similar one was used back in 1965 by then Sen. Ferdinand E. Marcos Sr. during his successful march to his first term as Philippine president.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nWith Trump\u2019s imminent assumption of office, the air is rife with speculations on how he would actually translate his campaign slogan into reality via specific programs, legislative proposals, and foreign policy. From the thrust of statements he\u2019s been making, it seems he intends to effect major structural policy and even sociopolitical changes on both the domestic and foreign affairs fronts. I will leave it to others to discuss sociopolitical matters, as those are more peculiar to American societal interaction that many others are more familiar with.\nFEATURED STORIES\nOPINION\nUrgent action needed vs online piracy as Congress session nears end\nOPINION\nLife has shortened\nOPINION\nThe gift of second chances\nSuffice it for me to observe, at the risk of being simplistic, that he appears determined to restore \u201ctraditional values,\u201d and put the brakes on the forward march of progressive liberalism particularly its so called \u201cwoke\u201d fringe. Somewhat associated with these are two of his highest priorities: securing US borders from the recent surge of illegal migrants, and rebalancing (as he sees it) the country\u2019s energy sector development strategy from a rapid headlong plunge into renewable energy dependence, toward a somewhat more gradual transition to that goal by restoring fossil fuel exploration, or as he puts it, \u201cDrill baby, drill.\u201d\nOn the domestic economic front, his game plan appears aimed at restoring dynamic economic growth by tax cuts and reduced government regulation. This, he hopes, would energize the private sector and put more disposable income in the pockets of the middle and working class, entrepreneurs, and corporations, thus creating jobs and hopefully, a virtuous cycle of higher employment rates that would broaden the tax base and generate a more positive budget outcome to meet the pressing financing needs of, among others, modernizing the country\u2019s infrastructure.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThe downside to this strategy is that the effect of tax cuts has a lag time during which already serious fiscal deficits may grow, resulting in even greater temptation to print money that will end up fueling inflation and escalating the level of national debt that even now threatens to become unmanageable. This latter vicious cycle outcome Trump hopes to stem by serious cuts in expenditure.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nSuch cuts appear to depend mainly on a draconian review of \u201cwasteful government expenditures\u201d by the envisioned new Department of Government Efficiency led by Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy. This involves the surgical trimming of perceived bloated bureaucracy in such agencies as the departments of education and of defense, and defense expenditure itself. The US defense budget is 10 times that of the next 10 countries in the world combined as it maintains 750 military bases in 80 countries. Furthermore, an announced centerpiece of Trump\u2019s foreign policy is to proactively encourage negotiations toward peace on all major war fronts, if only to carry the record of having no wars during his tenure.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nHowever, the bellicose side of his foreign policy, namely tariff drumbeating designed, it seems, to restore a more vibrant manufacturing sector to the US economy, could be problematic. He may find that his tendency toward breast beating may have to be balanced by his equally adept sense of the \u201cart of the deal\u201d toward win-win solutions in a world where BRICS\u2014a forum for cooperation among a group of emerging economies including Brazil, Russia, China and the United Arab Emirates\u2014is a serious reality rather than a pushover. As well, the evolution from a unipolar to a multipolar world order appears to be gaining momentum so that moves to preserve US trade and military dominance may have to be tempered with a wiser strategy of revitalizing US competitiveness toward winning the hearts and minds of the world\u2019s citizenry.\nAssuming things go reasonably well toward the MAGA scenario, what\u2019s in it for the Philippines? At the very least, a US economy averting pneumonia will help stabilize the value of the peso and continue the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas\u2019 already optimistic scenario of progressively lowering interest rates. There are also signs that the US is more interested in an investment-oriented, rather than a China-containment, policy with us, such that Musk is reportedly eyeing the Philippines as a significant center for his expanded Asian business operations. Under these circumstances, President Marcos would be well advised to lead in calming turbulent local political waters, refocusing on the country\u2019s economic priorities and comparative advantages, and dusting off his father\u2019s battle cry, \u201cThis nation can be great again.\u201d\nArticle continues after this advertisement\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\nRoberto F.

As the green beam pierced the darkness, one could almost imagine it as an unorthodox holiday greeting, albeit one that could potentially blind our sailors.\nIncidents like these remind us of the challenges faced by our courageous men and women guarding the waters of the West Philippine Sea. Hasa-Hasa Shoal, a part of our exclusive economic zone (EEZ), isn\u2019t just a spot on the map\u2014it\u2019s a resource-rich area teeming with marine life, a haven for Filipino fishers, and a symbol of our national identity.\nWhile the laser incident might sound like a scene from a sci-fi movie, it\u2019s a stark reminder of the reality we face: a need to assert our sovereign rights without losing sight of diplomacy and peace. Let us not be intimidated by these bright displays; instead, let them serve as a spotlight on the pressing need for unity\u2014both domestically and internationally.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThe Philippines has always been a nation that values dialogue, justice, and mutual respect. We have demonstrated our commitment to these principles through the legal and diplomatic avenues we\u2019ve pursued, most notably the 2016 arbitral ruling that affirmed our rights in the West Philippine Sea.\nFEATURED STORIES\nOPINION\nUrgent action needed vs online piracy as Congress session nears end\nOPINION\nLife has shortened\nOPINION\nThe gift of second chances\nYet, these rights are not just about us. They resonate with all nations that believe in the rule of law and the importance of maintaining peace and stability in international waters. Our maritime zones are part of a larger network that supports global trade, biodiversity, and climate resilience. Protecting these waters is a shared responsibility.\nWe call on our friends in the international community to shine a light of their own on this issue. This is not merely a bilateral matter between the Philippines and China; it\u2019s a question of respecting international law and ensuring that no nation can claim what isn\u2019t theirs through coercion or force.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nFrom Asean partners to the broader global family, we urge you to amplify your voices. Support initiatives that uphold peace and the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (Unclos). Stand with us in asserting that the future of these waters lies in sustainable development, not conflict.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nTo our fellow Filipinos, let this serve as a rallying cry\u2014not to war, but to unwavering vigilance and unity. Every fisher who sails these waters, every soldier who guards our outposts, and every citizen who supports our claim, strengthens our stance. Together, we are a nation that believes in fairness, peace, and sovereignty.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nAnd to the unidentified vessel that brought a light show to Hasa-Hasa Shoal, let this be our message: the Philippines does not stand in darkness. We are guided by the light of our laws, our allies, and our indomitable spirit.\nSo, let us steer forward, navigating these contested waters with confidence. The beam of justice and unity will always shine brighter than any laser.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nShermaine Anacleto,\nsheanacleto@gmail.com\nYour subscription could not be saved.

Duterte\u2019s office for his comment on the issue, but his staffer said that the lawmaker would not issue a statement since they do not know each other.\nThis is not the first time that Taguba and Guban implicated the younger Duterte as supposedly involved in smuggling.\nAt the first quad committee hearing in Pampanga last August 16,\nGuban said he was cautioned against naming Rep. Duterte\n, his brother-in-law and Vice President Sara Duterte\u2019s husband Manases Carpio, and businessman Michael Yang as involved in the \u201cshabu\u201d importation mess.\nRep. Duterte however questioned Guban\u2019s credibility, saying that\nhe does not know Guban\nand that he has never transacted with the former BOC official.&nbsp; The lawmaker also noted that the label \u201cstar witness\u201d is only reserved for individuals with credibility and not Guban, who had been cited for contempt by the Senate blue ribbon committee.\nTaguba meanwhile claimed during a previous quad committee hearing that\nhe never retracted his allegations that Rep.

REYES\nThe President\u2019s decision to ban Philippine offshore gaming operators (Pogos) has presented new challenges for the government, particularly the legal gaps related to managing assets such as buildings and lands confiscated from alleged criminal operations linked to these hubs.\nOver the past months, lawmakers and officials have proposed various uses for the idle properties, including converting them into evacuation centers, schools, or government offices.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nHowever, Justice Undersecretary Nicholas Ty, head of the Inter-Agency Council Against Trafficking (Iacat) established by law in 2012, highlighted one of the many concerns they faced: the need for immediate access to the resources seized from suspected scam hubs to support trafficking victims and Pogo employees rescued during raids.\nFEATURED STORIES\nGLOBALNATION\nPH asserts rights over Bajo de Masinloc at UN General Assembly\nGLOBALNATION\nPCG: China using AIS spoofing to mislead public and stir confusion\nGLOBALNATION\n'Aid for Kristine-hit Batangas': Presidential assistance for farmers, fisherfolk, families\n\u201c[There is] an absence of a clear provision that expressly empowers [the] state [to] provisionally use assets pending forfeiture, especially money that can be used to maintain victims and facilities,\u201d Ty told the Inquirer on Thursday.\nREAD:\nAuthorities raid Pogo hub in Bataan BPO company\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nAlthough the Anti-Financial Account Scamming Act signed in July 2024 addresses this matter, Ty noted that Iacat was still waiting for its implementing rules and regulations.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nIn the meantime, the government found a \u201ccreative solution\u201d\u2014\u201ccommandeering\u201d raided facilities and using them to house thousands of trafficking victims, he said.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nAccording to Iacat\u2019s records, over 3,000 Pogo employees have been rescued and \u201cpresumed to be victims of human trafficking.\u201d\n\u201cWe do not really have enough shelters to house these victims of trafficking, and if we do let them out, chances are they are just gonna be re-trafficked or revictimized in another scam hub,\u201d Ty said during a forum last Tuesday organized by the Stratbase ADR Institute.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nA comprehensive inventory of the total number of buildings, floor area, land area, and estimated value has not been published by the authorities following the raids on these hubs, notably those in Bamban, Tarlac, and Porac, Pampanga.\nThere has also been no disclosure of any plan by responsible government agencies to inspect these properties to determine whether they were suitable for classrooms, offices, medical facilities, evacuation centers, or other purposes while criminal and civil forfeiture cases are pending.\nNew Marcos warning\nLess than three weeks before his year-end deadline to shut down all Pogos in the country, which he announced in his State of the Nation Address in July, President Marcos warned that those who run \u201cguerrilla\u201d or rogue Pogo and internet gaming licensees (IGLs) after he had canceled all their licenses.\nMr. Marcos formalized the ban in November under Executive Order No. 74.\n\u201cWe will never let them wreak havoc on us again. Anyone who attempts to launch illegal operations will face the full force of our laws,\u201d the President said.\nHe posted his remarks on Facebook and Instagram on Wednesday night, after meeting with Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corp. (Pagcor) chair Alejandro Tengco, Presidential Anti-Organized Crime Commission (PAOCC) chief Gilbert Cruz, Interior Secretary Juan Victor \u201cJonvic\u201d Remulla and other government officials on winding down the operations of the remaining offshore gaming hubs.\nOn Thursday morning, the President ordered law enforcement agencies to carry out small but multiple operations against offshore gaming operators that were still running their businesses despite the ban.\nHe directed local officials to coordinate with the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) in going after Pogos and IGLs in their areas and ordered the DILG to step up gathering intelligence on the presence of Pogos in communities.\nCanceled licenses\nAccording to Malaca\u00f1ang, 53,700 Pogo licenses were canceled, while 18 IGLs voluntarily canceled theirs as of Nov. 29. By Dec. 31, all licenses will be deemed canceled, and the Philippines will supposedly be \u201cPogo-free\u201d by January 2025.\nIt said 353,000 visas had been issued to foreign workers for these gaming establishments. By the end of the Duterte administration, only 33,863 remained, and 23,099 of them recently left the country.\nMany more foreigners, mostly Chinese, entered the country as tourists and found jobs as Pogo workers, according to a Senate investigation of the pastillas scam. The total number of foreign workers working legally and illegally in Pogos could far exceed the number of legitimate employment visas issued by the government.\nDuring Tuesday\u2019s forum, Ty said that since Pogo hubs were usually one-stop shops, not just the offices but actual residences of the trafficking victims, the government used the facilities to temporarily house rescued workers there.\nHe said that under the Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act, \u201cproceeds of instruments of human trafficking can be forfeited in favor of Iacat for the benefit of victims of human trafficking.\u201d\nNo typical victim\nAnother significant legal challenge is \u201cvictim identification\u201d and \u201cforced criminality\u201d because many rescued individuals refuse to see themselves as trafficking victims, Ty said.\nHe said that human trafficking, often described as modern-day slavery, differs from past enslavement where victims were treated as property.\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s why it becomes even more complex in the victimology of the trafficking victims and the scam hubs. Because they are not, at least from the Philippine perspective, the typical trafficking victim who is from a very poor location who is mired in poverty, who is not that educated,\u201d he explained.\n\u201cThe victims of human trafficking, at least from the Philippines\u2014well, even from other countries\u2014they\u2019re usually college graduates from middle-income families. They\u2019re tech-savvy,\u201d Ty added.\nHe said the authorities will use other measures, such as anticorruption laws, to prosecute \u201cother enablers\u201d of human trafficking like government officials.\n\u2018Leakage\u2019 probe\nFor its part, the Supreme Court said it found no evidence linking members of the judiciary to the alleged \u201cleakage\u201d of information regarding the Porac raid last June.\nChief Justice Alexander Gesmundo on Wednesday told reporters that preliminary inquiries \u201cdid not get positive results\u201d and that judges and court staff were involved.\nWhen authorities raided the Pogo compound in Porac, the PAOCC found only 158 Chinese, Vietnamese, and Malaysians instead of the more than 1,000 individuals who were supposedly there at the time\u2014an indication that the operators had insider information about the raid.\nSen. Sherwin Gatchalian later alleged the result of the raid showed the possible influence of Chinese syndicates in the judiciary and that when PAOCC requested a search warrant, the Pogo operators received a tip.\nYour subscription could not be saved.

But the Philippine Coast Guard suspected it was probably just a glitch.\u2014Contributed photo\nSAN ANTONIO, ZAMBALES, Philippines \u2014 Residents of San Felipe town in this province were alarmed on Tuesday after seeing in a marine tracker what appeared to be a China Coast Guard (CCG) vessel near a dredging site.\nLocals who routinely monitor vessels operating in the Sto. Tomas River were taken aback upon detecting a vessel identified as a CCG ship with body No. 21543 approaching the area, according to Elezer Requirme, a resident and beach resort owner.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\n\u201cThere are currently four dredging vessels operating in the area, hauling sand and transporting it to a reclamation site in Manila Bay,\u201d Requirme said in a phone interview.\nFEATURED STORIES\nNEWSINFO\nBar exam 2024: List of successful examinees\nNEWSINFO\n3 schools have highest percentage of passers among first-time bar exam takers\nNEWSINFO\nHouse panel: Ex-president Duterte center of grand criminal enterprise\nHe said the vessel they saw appeared to be a CCG vessel on the tracker.\n\u201cWhen we checked again, it disappeared from the tracker, as though its AIS (automatic identification system) had been turned off,\u201d Requirme said.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nRequirme is among the residents who have been opposed to dredging operations in the province and a member of the group that monitors dredging vessels in Sto. Tomas using a marine tracker app.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nImmediate inspection\nResponding to their concerns, the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) personnel in Zambales immediately boarded all dredging vessels in the area for inspection.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nCmdr. Euphraim Jayson Diciano, chief of the PCG station in Zambales, assured residents that all vessels would be closely monitored, noting that their detection of a suspected CCG vessel may have been just due to a technical glitch.\n\u201cWe have located the vessel of concern and it is currently in Guangzhou, China. It could not have been in San Felipe because if the AIS was turned off, the marine tracker would only display its last known position,\u201d Diciano explained in a phone interview.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nUndocumented crew\nThe Zambales residents raised the matter a day after Sen. Risa Hontiveros also sounded the alarm over possible Chinese espionage using dredging operations as cover.\nIn a privilege speech on Monday, Hontiveros, the Senate deputy minority leader, cited a PCG report on the discovery of 13 undocumented Chinese nationals on the dredging vessel MV Harvest 89 in Mariveles, Bataan province, on Nov. 26.\n\u201cThe PCG personnel were shocked that during a routine predeparture inspection to secure a Masters Declaration of Safe Departure, the crew members attempted to deny them entry,\u201d she said.\n\u201cThe crew members told the PCG that their documentation was okay. Smelling a rat, our coast guards boarded the vessel where they discovered nine undocumented Chinese crew members, and when they searched deeper, they found four more, bringing the total to 13,\u201d the opposition senator added.\n\u2018PLA\u2019 uniform\nWhat\u2019s more shocking, Hontiveros said, was the discovery inside the vessel of a People\u2019s Liberation Army uniform similar to what was found in illegal Philippine offshore gaming operator (Pogo) hubs.\nShe noted that this was not the first time the PCG caught dredging vessels engaged in suspicious activities.\nIn May this year, the PCG also apprehended a vessel pretending to carry a Philippine flag when it was actually registered in Sierra Leone. Its crew members were all Chinese nationals, she said.\n\u201cThe presence of undocumented Chinese nationals aboard a vessel engaged in such contentious operations is a chilling revelation. What were they doing there? Who permitted their entry? Were they acting as laborers, or, as some fear, engaging in activities of an intelligence-gathering nature?\u201d asked Hontiveros.\n\u201cEspionage is not merely the stuff of spy novels. As we have sadly learned due to recent events, it is a clear and present danger in the modern geopolitical landscape. As Nica (National Intelligence Coordinating Agency) had said during our recently concluded Pogo hearings in which a Philippine mayor was confirmed by our intelligence apparatus to be an \u2018agent of influence,\u2019 all regions of our country have been infiltrated by agents of the Chinese Communist Party,\u201d she added.\n\u2018Nasasalisihan tayo\u2019\nHontiveros was referring to Alice Guo, the dismissed mayor of Bamban, Tarlac, who is now detained and facing charges after being linked to an online gaming hub that was raided in her town.\n\u201cWhen foreign nationals operate covertly in our territory, it compromises not only our security apparatus but also the trust of our citizens in the government\u2019s ability to protect them,\u201d she said.\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m scared of is that while we are busy with all that\u2019s happening in our country, our enemies are creeping in (nasasalisihan tayo),\u201d she added.\nIn her speech, Hontiveros said the company behind the dredging activity in Bataan was the China state-run firm China Harbour Engineer Co. (CHEC) which was earlier blacklisted by the United States for its alleged role in the militarization of the South China Sea, as well as by the World Trade Organization for alleged corrupt practices.\nEnvironmental damage\nHontiveros urged the Department of Justice, through the Bureau of Immigration, to investigate the undocumented persons aboard the vessels and review their Alien Employment Certificates issued by the Department of Labor and Employment.\nShe also asked the Department of Environment and Natural Resources to conduct an exhaustive assessment of the environmental damage caused by the dredging operations and hold responsible parties accountable.\nHontiveros said there should also be a review of all existing agreements that permit foreign entities to engage in resource extraction or related activities within Philippine waters to ensure that the agreements align not just with ecological preservation but also with national security.\nYour subscription could not be saved.

        "content": "The jubilant streets of Damascus are awash with a sense of freedom. Women perform the \u201czaghrouta,\u201d a piercing, celebratory ululation; men chant slogans; and the nation collectively breathes a sigh of relief. The fall of Bashar al-Assad and his flight to Moscow signals the end of an era of repression. Yet, amidst the celebrations, the echoes of history remind us that such moments are but the first steps in the arduous journey of transition.\nAssad\u2019s dramatic departure is reminiscent of other despots forced into exile: Ferdinand Marcos Sr. fleeing to Hawaii in 1986, laden with treasures looted from the Philippine people; Muammar Gaddafi\u2019s brutal demise in Libya; and Saddam Hussein\u2019s humiliating fall in Iraq. Each instance of a dictator\u2019s downfall has triggered euphoria, but also exposed deep challenges in the aftermath. For Syria, these challenges loom large, as the nation grapples with the legacies of autocratic rule, civil war, and external meddling.\nFor over 50 years, the Assad family ruled with an iron fist, crushing dissent and maintaining power through a maze of alliances. The civil war that erupted in 2011 triggered heightened repression, leading to decades of unimaginable suffering: hundreds of thousands dead and millions displaced.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nScenes of jubilation in Syria mirror those of the Edsa People Power Revolution in the Philippines, where citizens took to the streets to topple Marcos Sr.\u2019s regime. Just as Filipinos dismantled the vestiges of a dictator\u2019s reign\u2014smashing statues and reclaiming public spaces\u2014Syrians now seize the moment to exorcise symbols of the Assad family\u2019s domination. Yet, while the Philippines managed a relatively swift transition to democratic rule, Syria\u2019s path is far more uncertain.\nFEATURED STORIES\nOPINION\nUrgent action needed vs online piracy as Congress session nears end\nOPINION\nLife has shortened\nOPINION\nThe gift of second chances\nHistory offers cautionary tales for Syria. Libya and Iraq, both torn apart after the fall of autocratic regimes, failed to establish stable political orders. These examples highlight the dangers of power vacuums and unbridled factionalism. Syria\u2019s deeply fragmented opposition, including Islamist groups like Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and Kurdish factions under the Syrian Democratic Forces, is emblematic of these challenges. HTS, despite its pledge to embrace inclusivity, remains burdened by a controversial past with ties to al-Qaida, casting doubt on its ability to foster unity.\nThe stakes are further complicated by Syria\u2019s geopolitical significance. Regional powers such as Turkey, Iran, and Israel, alongside global actors like Russia and the United States, have entrenched themselves in the conflict. Israel\u2019s recent seizure of a buffer zone in the Golan Heights, Turkey\u2019s ongoing skirmishes with Kurdish forces, Russian interests in maintaining influence, and US preemptive strikes to deny weapons caches from remnant ISIS forces, underscore the volatile landscape. Any transition must navigate these external pressures while addressing domestic fissures.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThe nation\u2019s ethnic and sectarian divisions, exacerbated by years of war, require sensitive reconciliation efforts. The abundance of weapons among various factions raises the specter of prolonged violence, as former allies in the fight against the Assad regime may turn on one another. Syria\u2019s infrastructure lies in ruins, and its oil reserves, controlled by Kurdish forces, remain a contentious issue. International aid and investment are essential for rebuilding, but political instability and mistrust could hinder these efforts.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nDespite these challenges, there are reasons for cautious optimism. Rebel leaders have expressed commitments to pluralism and minority rights, signaling a potential departure from the Assad regime\u2019s exclusionary policies. Turkey, despite its complex role in the conflict, sees stability in Syria as a chance to repatriate millions of Syrian refugees. The international community, led by the United Nations, has pledged support for a peaceful transition. Such external engagement, coupled with lessons learned from other post-conflict transitions, could provide a framework for demilitarization, power sharing, and justice.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThe experiences of the Philippines, Libya, and Iraq serve as reminders of the perils and possibilities inherent in regime change. While the fall of Bashar al-Assad is a victory for the Syrian people, the road ahead demands wisdom, resilience, and unity.\nIn the Edsa People Power Revolution, Filipinos found strength in collective action, dismantling martial rule, and reclaiming democracy. Similarly, Syrians now have the opportunity to forge a new identity rooted in inclusivity and justice. The fall of Bashar al-Assad is an opportunity for reinvention, though fraught with risks. The lessons of history caution against complacency. Celebrations must give way to dialogue, and euphoria must be tempered by the hard work of nation-building.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\ndoyromero@gmail.com\nYour subscription could not be saved.

These actions aim to manipulate how people think, weaken democratic institutions, and challenge the country\u2019s sovereignty, creating a serious threat to the Philippines\u2019 stability.\nThe move to ban Pogos is a crucial step toward helping the Philippines exit the Financial Action Task Force\u2019s grey list. Earlier this year, President Marcos instructed relevant government agencies to address the country\u2019s \u201cgrey listing.\u201d The government has set a deadline to exit the grey list by the start of 2024 after missing the original target of January 2023.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nIn the legislature, Sen.

Only 5 percent of Filipinos say they \u201cwill support\u201d a pro-China candidate, while 23 percent are ambivalent.\nMeanwhile, a Social Weather Stations (SWS) survey conducted in the same month revealed that fighting corruption, job creation, livelihood generation, and financial literacy are the key components that should be central to a senatorial platform in the 2025 elections.\nThe SWS survey also found that nine out of 10 Filipinos (91 percent) agreed that \u201cgovernment officials involved in corruption must be held accountable.\u201d\nThe issue of Pogos has exposed the weaknesses and vulnerabilities of our systems, especially with foreign influence combined with Filipinos posing as leaders who put their interests above all else. Pogos reveal very deep and alarming issues, and these must be addressed right now before they can do more harm.\nElections are a time for people to be heard.

Associated Press\nCAPE TOWN, South Africa \u2014 President Joe Biden is finally making his long-promised visit to Africa this week, attempting to showcase a U.S.-backed railway project in three countries that he has pushed as a new approach in countering some of China\u2019s global influence.\nBiden\u2019s first visit to the continent as president \u2014 which he left to the very end \u2014 will highlight the Lobito Corridor railway redevelopment in Zambia, Congo and Angola. It aims to advance U.S. presence in a region rich in the critical minerals used in batteries for electric vehicles, electronic devices and clean energy technologies.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThat\u2019s a key field for U.S.-China competition and China has a stranglehold on Africa\u2019s critical minerals.\nFEATURED STORIES\nGLOBALNATION\nPCG: China using AIS spoofing to mislead public and stir confusion\nGLOBALNATION\nPH asserts rights over Bajo de Masinloc at UN General Assembly\nGLOBALNATION\n'Aid for Kristine-hit Batangas': Presidential assistance for farmers, fisherfolk, families\nA new strategy\nThe U.S. has for years built relations in Africa through trade, security and humanitarian aid. The 800-mile (1,300-kilometer), $2.5 billion railway upgrade is a different move and has shades of China\u2019s Belt and Road foreign infrastructure strategy that has surged ahead.\nREAD:\nBiden\u2019s promised visit to Africa shows no signs of happening yet\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThe Biden administration has called the corridor one of the president\u2019s signature initiatives.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nBiden starts a three-day trip to Angola on Monday, yet Lobito\u2019s future and any change in the way the United States engages with a continent of 1.4 billion leaning heavily toward China depends on the incoming administration of Donald Trump.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\n\u201cPresident Biden is no longer the story,\u201d said Mvemba Dizolele, the director of the Africa Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington-based think tank. \u201cEven African leaders are focused on Donald Trump.\u201d\nA fit for Trump\u2019s vision?\nThe U.S. has committed hundreds of millions of dollars to the Lobito Corridor alongside financing from the European Union, the Group of Seven leading industrialized nations, a Western-led private consortium and African banks.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\n\u201cA lot is riding on this in terms of its success and its replicability,\u201d said Tom Sheehy, a fellow at the United States Institute of Peace, a nonpartisan federal research institution.\nREAD:\nBiden fetes Kenyan leader as Africa competition grows\nHe called it one of the flagships for the G7\u2019s new Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment, which was driven by Biden and aims to reach other developing nations as a response to China\u2019s Belt and Road.\nBiden promised to visit Africa last year after reviving the U.S.-Africa Summit for the first time in nearly a decade in December 2022. The trip was kicked back to 2024 and delayed again this October because of Hurricane Milton, reinforcing a sentiment among Africans that their continent is still low priority. The last U.S. president to visit was Barack Obama in 2015.\n\u201cAfrica never gets top attention,\u201d said Witney Schniedman, an expert on African economic growth at the nonprofit Brookings Institution.\nBut many are optimistic that the Lobito project, which isn\u2019t due for completion until well after Biden has left office, will survive a change of administration and be given a chance. It goes some way to blunting China, which has bipartisan backing and is high on Trump\u2019s to-do list.\n\u201cAs long as they keep labeling Lobito one of the main anti-China tools in Africa, there is a certain likelihood that it\u2019s going to keep being funded,\u201d said Christian-G\u00e9raud Neema, who analyzes China-Africa relations.\nSome success in Africa\nThe Lobito Corridor will be an upgrade and extension of a railway line from the copper and cobalt mines of northern Zambia and southern Congo to Angola\u2019s Atlantic Ocean port of Lobito, a route west for Africa\u2019s critical minerals.\nIt\u2019s little more than a starting point for the U.S. and its partners, because China is dominant in the mining in Zambia and Congo. Congo has more than 70% of the world\u2019s cobalt, most of which is heading to China to reinforce its critical mineral supply chain that the U.S. and Europe have to rely on.\nLobito was made possible by some American diplomatic success in Angola that led to a Western consortium winning the bid for the project in 2022 ahead of Chinese competition, a surprise given Angola\u2019s long and strong ties with Beijing. China financed a previous redevelopment of the railway.\nThe Biden administration accelerated American outreach to Angola, turning around what was an antagonistic relationship three decades ago when the U.S. armed anti-government rebels in Angola\u2019s civil war. U.S.-Angola trade was $1.77 billion last year, while the U.S. has a stronger stake in regional security through a strategic presence on the Atlantic Ocean, and Angolan President Jo\u00e3o Louren\u00e7o\u2019s role mediating in a conflict in eastern Congo.\nIn Angola, Biden will announce new developments on health, agribusiness, security cooperation as well as the Lobito Corridor, White House officials said on a preview call with reporters.\nThe visit, the first by a sitting U.S. president to Angola, will \u201chighlight that remarkable evolution of the U.S.-Angola relationship,\u201d Frances Brown, a special assistant to the president and senior director for African affairs at the National Security Council, said on a separate call.\nIt will also draw attention to a perennial challenge for America\u2019s value-based diplomacy in Africa. International rights groups have used Biden\u2019s trip to criticize the Louren\u00e7o government\u2019s authoritarian shift. Political opponents have been imprisoned and allegedly tortured, while security and other laws have been passed in Angola that severely restrict freedoms, throwing some scrutiny on Washington\u2019s new African partnership.\nWill the US really show up?\nThose calling for more U.S. presence in Africa say Angola and the Lobito spinoff show what might be achieved, even with China-facing countries, if the U.S. is willing to consistently engage. But they see signs for Africa when China has held a summit with African leaders every three years since 2000, while the US has had just two summits, in 2014 and 2022, and there are no plans for the next one.\nMichelle Gavin, a former U.S. ambassador to Botswana and adviser on Africa to Obama, said that the U.S. had failed to take Africa seriously over multiple administrations, a bipartisan trend. She doesn\u2019t see Biden\u2019s visit and Lobito being a major \u201cinflection point\u201d that will drive a new U.S. focus across Africa.\nYour subscription could not be saved.

Paolo Duterte at the Batasang Pambansa building in Quezon City, the Vice President said she faced mortal danger from the Speaker of the House.\nShe said she told the House sergeant-at-arms, retired police Maj. Gen. Napoleon Taas, that she didn\u2019t need any extra security personnel as she had brought her own.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\n\u201cIf anything happens to me here inside (the House), there is only one person who wants to kill me, and that\u2019s (Speaker) Martin Romualdez,\u201d she said.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nBut she added: \u201cI don\u2019t think he will do that here inside. He will do it outside.\u201d\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nRomualdez on Thursday called out Duterte for sending her officials instead of herself to explain to lawmakers her use of P612.5 million in confidential funds of the OVP and the Department of Education when she was still the education secretary from 2022 to 2023.\n\u201cShe should now appear, take the oath, speak and explain,\u201d Romualdez told reporters in Butuan City on Thursday. \u201cShe shouldn\u2019t let her officials at the OVP and DepEd handle (the explanations).\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nShe should be the one to speak.\u201d\nOvernight stay\nAccording to House officials, Duterte made the move to place herself inside the House on Thursday night, arriving at the Batasang Pambansa in Quezon City around 7:40 p.m. supposedly to visit Lopez, who was cited for contempt and ordered detained a day earlier.\nLopez, 50, who had twice served as Davao City administrator when Duterte was the city mayor, was cited for her \u201cevasive\u201d answers to a House inquiry into the Vice President\u2019s use of confidential funds and for \u201cundue interference\u201d in the House\u2019s oversight function by telling the Commission on Audit (COA) not to hand over audit reports on the funds to the committee looking into the spending of the OVP.\nAfter detention visits ended at 10 p.m. on Thursday, Duterte refused to leave the House and locked herself inside the office of her brother, Davao Rep. Paolo Duterte, where she stayed overnight, according to Taas.\nHouse Secretary General Reginald Velasco said that Duterte and her staff remained in her brother\u2019s office and refused to leave even after they had shut down power, which the House normally does ahead of the long weekend as its offices are closed from Friday to Sunday.\nIn a statement on Friday, Senior Deputy Speaker Aurelio Gonzales Jr., Majority Leader Manuel Jose Dalipe and Deputy Speaker David Suarez denounced Duterte\u2019s brazen disrespect of the chamber and her serious breach of security.\n\u201cNo matter how many times she was asked by our House sergeant-at-arms to leave, she has ignored it,\u201d they said. \u201cIf she does not have respect for simple rules, how can we trust that she is able to respect the bigger responsibilities she must do as an elected public official?\u201d\nManila Rep. Joel Chua, who heads the House committee on good government and accountability investigating Duterte\u2019s alleged misuse of confidential funds as Vice President when she was education secretary, said at a press conference that he had denied Duterte\u2019s request to stay with Lopez inside the House detention facility.\nRequest denied\nIn a Nov. 21 letter to Chua, Vice President Duterte appealed on humanitarian grounds to stay with Lopez, expressing concern for her chief of staff\u2019s health and well-being.\nShe listed down, among others, Lopez\u2019s chronic back problems, nausea, lightheadedness, and fears for her safety.\nChua rejected her request, citing the strict rules of the Office of the Sergeant-at-Arms (Osaa) regarding detention, adding that the facility was exclusively for detainees.\nBut Duterte pressed on, stating in another letter on Friday her intent to visit Lopez daily \u201cfor the full period of her detention\u201d according to the guidelines of the Osaa pertaining to persons under House custody.\nDuring her Zoom press conference, Duterte was asked why she was evading the House probe. She replied that the House was imposing \u201cunconstitutional\u201d rules in its hearings and planned to legally challenge its investigation.\n\u201cThey have no investigatorial, prosecutorial powers, and they must respect the rights of people appearing,\u201d she said.\nThe Vice President said she was consulting her lawyers regarding the possibility of taking the legislators to court and that \u201cthey are ready\u201d to file cases against House members.\nBrother lets her stay\nHer brother informed Chua in a letter that he had given her permission to \u201cstay indefinitely in my office to discharge her day-to-day duties.\u201d\n\u201cThe Vice President\u2019s stay will also correspond to her visits to (Lopez) and other OVP personnel currently detained,\u201d he said, adding that she was \u201camenable\u201d to staying there even without water and electricity.\nThe Vice President told reporters that she could stay in her brother\u2019s office until New Year\u2019s Day.\nChua, sounding exasperated, asked whether \u201cwe need to remind the Vice President to follow the law.\u201d\n\u201cOur Vice President is a lawyer, she is the second-highest official of the land. We took an oath of service which stated that we will follow the rules of the land,\u201d Chua said.\nPlay for sympathy\nOther lawmakers also condemned Duterte\u2019s actions which they said was an attempt to influence the proceedings against her and even curry public sympathy for her as she continued to dodge the hearings into her confidential fund use.\nZambales Rep. Jay Khonghun said he couldn\u2019t help \u201cbut be suspicious of her motives of offering to join her chief of staff in detention,\u201d saying that she might just want to stop Lopez from testifying once the committee resumes its inquiry on Monday.\n\u201cOr is this just for show, another attempt at heroics? \u2026 Is this the Duterte brand?\u201d he asked. \u201cWhy is their behavior bereft of respect? Why act like a brat?\u201d\nACT Teachers Rep. France Castro also questioned Duterte\u2019s \u201cselective appearance\u201d at the House.\n\u201cIf she has nothing to hide, why doesn\u2019t she face us? Her continued absence from our hearings while finding time for other House visits only reinforces public doubt about the use of these funds,\u201d she said.\nDavao origins\nDuterte attended a hearing called by the quad committee on Nov. 13 to show solidarity with her father, former President Rodrigo Duterte, whose brutal drug war was under investigation.\nThis time, she literally stayed in the House to show support for Lopez.\nLopez, a niece of former Mayor Elias Lopez, first entered the Davao City government service as city council secretary in 2007, when Duterte first ran and won as vice mayor in the city.\nWhen Duterte won as mayor in 2010, she picked Lopez as her city administrator.\nLopez gained the reputation of a no-nonsense executive.\nREAD:\nHouse orders transfer of VP Duterte\u2019s aide to women\u2019s prison\nAmong her earliest directives was a dress code at City Hall, where people from the far-flung villages used to be at ease and were welcomed wearing only their slippers when the older Duterte was the city mayor.\nIn 2013, when her father again ran for mayor, Duterte withdrew from politics and went full time into her private legal practice.\nShe again picked Lopez as her city administrator when she won again as mayor and her father became President in 2016.\nYour subscription could not be saved.

        "content": "The recent election of Donald Trump as President of the United States is set to significantly influence the electronics industry, a sector already navigating the complexities of global trade, supply chain management, and technological innovation. As Trump begins his second term, the implications for this vital industry are multifaceted, encompassing trade policies, regulatory changes, and shifts in international relations, particularly with China.\nTrade policies and tariffs. One of the most immediate impacts of Trump\u2019s presidency on the electronics industry will likely stem from his approach to trade. During his first term, Trump implemented a series of tariffs aimed at reducing the trade deficit and protecting American manufacturing. These tariffs, particularly on Chinese imports, have already reshaped the landscape for electronics manufacturers.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nIn his second term, Trump has proposed even more aggressive tariffs, including a potential 60-percent tariff on all goods from China. Such measures could drastically increase costs for electronics companies that rely on Chinese manufacturing for components and finished products. The Consumer Technology Association has warned that these tariffs could lead to significant price increases for consumers, with estimates suggesting that laptop prices could nearly double and smartphones could see a 26-percent increase. This scenario poses a substantial risk to consumer electronics affordability and could dampen overall market demand.\nFEATURED STORIES\nOPINION\nUrgent action needed vs online piracy as Congress session nears end\nOPINION\nLife has shortened\nOPINION\nThe gift of second chances\nSupply chain disruptions. The electronics industry is characterized by complex global supply chains that depend on the seamless flow of components across borders. The potential for heightened tariffs may force manufacturers to seek alternative suppliers or relocate production, which could disrupt established relationships and increase operational costs.\nAs companies navigate these challenges, they may also face delays in production and delivery, further complicating their ability to meet consumer demand. The uncertainty surrounding trade policies could lead to a more cautious approach to investment in new technologies and product development, as companies weigh the risks of potential tariff impacts against the need for innovation.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nRegulatory environment and innovation. Trump\u2019s administration has historically favored deregulation, which could have mixed implications for the electronics industry. On one hand, reduced regulatory burdens may foster innovation and allow companies to operate more freely. However, this approach could also lead to a lack of oversight in critical areas such as data privacy and cybersecurity, raising concerns among consumers and advocacy groups.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThe electronics sector, particularly in areas like artificial intelligence and data management, may experience a shift in regulatory focus. Trump\u2019s administration has indicated a desire to dismantle existing frameworks that govern technology development, potentially leading to a more laissez-faire environment. While this could spur rapid advancements in certain technologies, it may also create risks related to consumer protection and ethical considerations.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThe future of the CHIPS Act. The CHIPS and Science Act, passed during the Biden administration, aims to bolster the US semiconductor manufacturing and reduce reliance on foreign supply chains. During his campaign, Trump criticized the CHIPS Act, labeling it as \u201cso bad\u201d and suggesting that tariffs would be more effective for manufacturing than the funding provided by the act.\nWhile some experts express concern about potential repeal efforts, others believe that Trump may recognize the bipartisan support for the CHIPS Act and its importance for American manufacturing. The semiconductor industry has seen significant investments due to the act, particularly in states like Arizona, where companies like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Limited and Intel are expanding operations. If Trump chooses to modify rather than repeal the CHIPS Act, there may be opportunities to streamline funding processes or expand the scope of the Act to include energy generation, given the high energy demands of semiconductor manufacturing. This could lead to a more robust framework that supports both semiconductor production and sustainable energy initiatives.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThe projected impact of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency on the electronics industry is complex and multifaceted. His proposed trade policies, particularly aggressive tariffs, could lead to significant price increases for consumers and disrupt established supply chains. While deregulation may foster innovation, it also raises concerns about consumer protection and ethical considerations.\nAs the industry navigates these challenges, companies will need to remain agile and responsive to the evolving landscape. The ability to adapt to changing trade dynamics, regulatory environments, and consumer preferences will be crucial for success in an increasingly competitive and uncertain world. The future of the electronics industry will depend on how well it can balance the pressures of cost, innovation, and ethical responsibility in the face of a shifting political landscape.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\nArthur Tan was president of Ayala chipmaker, IMI for 23 years.

        "content": "I saw many posts online about Dominican Fr. Gustavo Guti\u00e9rrez, proudly Peruvian, popularly known as one of the fathers of liberation theology, who died on Oct. 22 at the age of 96. I thought, why don\u2019t I post mine, too, my one-on-one interview with him in 2000, the turn of the century, when he visited the Philippines. He was 72 then. Someone like him might not come this way again when the world is in a mess, politically, environmentally, culturally and the so-called happiness index in some parts has plummeted.\nThe influence of this man\u2019s revolutionary ideas, of his life as a priest, theologian, and action man went beyond the Catholic Church. Who was Guti\u00e9rrez that grassroots development workers both in the church and secular setting were so inspired by him?\nFirst let me say that community organizing among the poor and oppressed had four key influences: theology of liberation for which Guti\u00e9rrez was known, Saul Alinsky (conflict resolution), Paulo Freire (pedagogy of the oppressed and Marxist analysis).\nArticle continues after this advertisement\n\u201cPoverty is the first violence,\u201d he said to me. I was dumbstruck. Suddenly the word \u201cpoor\u201d took on a new nuance especially because he kept referring to them as \u201cthe last ones.\u201d But wait. He also spoke about poverty as a way of life that could be embraced, not only by those in the so-called consecrated life but also by those of us right smack in the heart of a messy, consumerist world. Here goes:\nFEATURED STORIES\nOPINION\nUrgent action needed vs online piracy as Congress session nears end\nOPINION\nLife has shortened\nOPINION\nThe gift of second chances\n\u201cPoverty is an act of love and liberation. It has a redemptive value. If the ultimate cause of human exploitation and alienation is selfishness, the deepest reason for voluntary poverty is love of neighbor. Christian poverty has meaning only as a commitment of solidarity with the poor who suffer misery and injustice. The commitment is to witness to the evil which has resulted from the sin and is a breach of communion.\n\u201cIt is not a question of idealizing poverty, but rather of taking it on as it is\u2014an evil\u2014to protest against it and to struggle to avoid it \u2026 It is poverty lived not for its own sake, but rather as an authentic imitation of Christ, it is poverty which means taking on the sinful human condition to liberate humankind from sin and all its consequences.\u201d\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nHe defined theology as \u201ca way to speak on God, a language of God\u201d and that liberation theology is \u201cnot a sociological or economic program\u201d but something that addresses the consciousness in order to change it. The consequence of this is solidarity with the poor and helping them to not accept poverty as fate.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nMy take from left field: In this 21st-century landscape and in speaking of the poor, let us stop idealizing \u201cFilipino resilience\u201d as the gold standard of virtues.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nFor those squeamish about liberation theology because it had been wrongly associated with Marxism, Guti\u00e9rrez said that \u201cpeople today are in a better position to understand our theology.\u201d There was never any mention of armed struggled in his writings, he stressed. \u201cWe have affirmed this and the Latin American bishops have affirmed his. It is not a justification for any other violence.\u201d So, comprende?\nBut, indeed, there was a time when some church elements misunderstood liberation theology. Even a United States report did say that liberation theology was dangerous to US foreign policy. This twisted thinking must have had a bearing on the killings of priests and nuns by right-wing military regimes.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThe major source of liberation theology is the Bible, Gutierrez reminded. \u201cIt is the effort of liberation theology to read the Bible from the concrete situation of poor persons.\u201d My sneaky retort: \u201cAre top guys in the church not reading it that way?\u201d He singled out models who got it right: the assassinated bishop of El Salvador \u00d3scar Romero (now a canonized saint) and Brazil\u2019s Dom H\u00e9lder C\u00e2mara.\nThe Bible, he said, is not to be read the way we read a beautiful book but from the point of the poor of history. We miss out on this, he said, because we tend to think of religion as without so many requirements. \u201cWe like a quiet religion,\u201d he added, \u201cthat revolved around our little lives,\u201d when, in fact, the whole view of the Bible is from the point of view of those who are considered the last, the insignificant (\u201cinsinyeeficant,\u201d he would say) because of class, color, gender, culture. (In our context, it is ang mga nasa laylayan ng lipunan.)\nWhat does his priesthood mean to him? \u201cService of God and the poor,\u201d he replied. \u201cIt is one way, not the only way. It is not necessarily better, it is \u201cdee-ferrrent.\u201d Better depends on the quality of commitment, \u201cnot on my status as a priest.\u201d\nDid he have favorite biblical figures, the great prophets perhaps who railed against oppressors? He had many, he said, but this time he singled out the Book of Job in the Old Testament to stress a point. It is about justice and \u201cthe gratuitous love of God.\u201d Matthew 25, too, he added.

They had six Top 10 hits on the Billboard charts by the time they disbanded in 2016 and a highly loyal fan base, known as \u201cDirectioners,\u201d many of them teen girls.\n\u201cI\u2019ve always loved One Direction since I was little,\u201d said 18-year-old Juana Relh, another fan outside Payne\u2019s hotel. \u201cTo see that he died and that there will never be another reunion of the boys is unbelievable, it kills me.\u201d\nWith his meteoric rise to fame, Payne had said that it took some time to adjust to the public eye.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you can ever deal with that, it\u2019s all a bit crazy for us to see that people get in that sort of state of mind about us and what we do,\u201d he said in a 2013 interview with the AP after recounting an experience where a fan was in a state of shock upon meeting him.\nOne Direction announced an indefinite \u201chiatus\u201d in 2016, and Payne \u2014 like each of his erstwhile bandmates \u2014 pursued a solo career, shifting toward EDM and hip-hop.\nOne Direction members, from left, Harry Styles, Louis Tomlinson, Zayn Malik, Niall Horan and Liam Payne perform on NBC\u2019s \u201cToday\u201d show, Nov. 13, 2012 in New York.

Payne\u2019s 2017 single \u201cStrip That Down,\u201d featuring Quavo, reached the Billboard Top 10, and stayed on the charts for several months. He put out&nbsp;\nan album \u201cLP1\u201d\n&nbsp;in 2019, and his last release \u2014 a single called \u201cTeardrops\u201d \u2014 was released in March.\nIn 2020, to mark the 10th anniversary of One Direction, Payne shared a screenshot of a text message he sent to his father on the day he joined the group, which read: \u201cI\u2019m in a boyband.\u201d\n\u201cWhat a journey\u2026 I had no idea what we were in for when I sent this text to my dad years ago at this exact time the band was formed,\u201d he wrote.\nPayne had a&nbsp;\n7-year-old son, Bear Grey Payne,\n&nbsp;with his former girlfriend, the&nbsp;\nmusician Cheryl\n&nbsp;who was known as Cheryl Cole when she performed with Girls Aloud.\nShe was an \u201cX Factor\u201d judge during One Direction\u2019s season, although their relationship began years later. Payne was previously engaged to Maya Henry, from August 2020 to early 2022. Henry released a novel earlier this year that she said was based on their relationship.\nIn addition to his son, he is survived by his parents, Geoff and Karen Payne, and his two older sisters, Ruth and Nicola.\nWant stories like this delivered straight to your inbox?\nStay informed.

Nowadays, it\u2019s becoming more expensive due to rising maintenance and insurance costs.&nbsp;\nThe United States has been deploying autonomous vehicles for ride-hailing services, such as Waymo.\nTesla CEO Elon Musk even promised his upcoming robotaxis will let their owners earn passive income.&nbsp;\nHe claimed they\u2019ll ferry passengers while their owners are busy so that they can earn money.\nHowever, artificial intelligence needs further improvement before self-driving cars become a major part of the global economy.\n3. Financial services\nFree stock photo from Unsplash\nMore apps are deploying AI investment and financial advisors to deliver more personalized recommendations.&nbsp;\nFor example, Google says AI can study customer journeys, peer interactions, and financial goals to suggest financial products and services.&nbsp;\nMany apps have been providing such services, but they\u2019ve become more convenient due to Large language models (LLMs).\nThese AI models allow these mobile programs to understand natural language, letting users describe their needs as if speaking with a real person.&nbsp;\nThey can also analyze documents to help financial institutions find investment opportunities and offer more suitable loans to clients.&nbsp;\nNonetheless, more consumer trust and stronger regulations are necessary to integrate AI into the financial sector safely and effectively.\n4. Retail and consumer\nFree stock photo from Unsplash\nAI-powered recommendations are also present in online shopping apps.&nbsp;\nNowadays, artificial intelligence allows these programs to push products and services that likely meet shoppers\u2019 demands.\nAs a result, the platforms earn more and consumers receive better customer service.&nbsp;\nThese technologies may also guide online businesses to improve their offerings after analyzing consumer trends.\nBusinesses can create AI-generated mockups to test products and services before pushing them to market. Consequently, it could reduce waste from product development.\nFor example, this Inquirer Tech\narticle\nreported a Filipino student who created stunning AI-generated dresses based on local myths.\nUS-based online shopping cloud platform SellersCommerce says over 33% of the world\u2019s population shops online.&nbsp;\nAs a result, AI\u2019s impact on eCommerce will inevitably affect the global economy.\n5. Technology, communications, and entertainment\nFree stock photo from Unsplash\nArtificial intelligence is making it easier to recommend the most suitable content to viewers.&nbsp;\nThis strategy is now common in online platforms like YouTube and TikTok. Moreover, AI helps these platforms organize content and monitor revenue generation.\nThis benefit trickles down to content creators, who use AI-assisted insights to provide more content that appeals to their audiences.&nbsp;\nSouth Korea takes this to the next level by creating online performers with artificial intelligence.\nThis\narticle\nexplains how tech company Pulse9 created the first-ever AI-generated K-pop group, Eternity.\n6.

Consequently, companies are investing in various sources that could meet this demand.&nbsp;\nFor example, Google signed an agreement with Kairos Power. It will develop small nuclear reactors and then Google will purchase their energy output.&nbsp;\nLearn more about this collaboration\nhere\n.\n8. Transport and logistics\nFree stock photo from Unsplash\nPwC says autonomous trucking could reduce transportation costs for companies, reducing costs and increasing asset utilization.&nbsp;\nAI-assisted trucking could also disrupt transportation and logistics as new companies may offer such services.\nMoreover, large online retailers may spread AI T&amp;L into their branches, fueling demand for these smaller providers.&nbsp;\nThe MIT Sloan School of Management says artificial intelligence could learn from logistics data to better monitor and adjust supply chains.&nbsp;\nIn turn, companies could become more resilient to sudden supply disruptions, consistently delivering goods regardless of such changes.\nA closer look into AI\u2019s impact on the global economy\nDaron Acemoglu writes a Letter from America \u2018AI and economic growth: Dreams versus theory\u2019 in the latest RES Quarterly Newsletter \u2013 Issue 205, April 2024.\nRead more\ud83d\udc49\nhttps://t.co/IZjfefIooe\n#EconTwitter\n#economy\n#news\n#membership\n#AI\npic.twitter.com/rIMrLYPaGv\n\u2014 Royal Economic Society (@RoyalEconSoc)\nApril 16, 2024\nThe overwhelming hype for AI\u2019s transformative effects can be overwhelming as multiple sources report on them 24/7.\nFortunately, Nobel-winning economist Daron Acemoglu offered a more clear-minded take on the ongoing trend.&nbsp;\nIn an interview with MIT News, he cited a paper from Economic Policy called \u201cThe Simple Macroeconomics of AI.\u201d&nbsp;\nIt says AI will produce a \u201cmodest increase\u201d in GDP between 1.1% to 1.6% over the next decade. Also, it will produce a 0.05% annual productivity growth.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we should belittle 0.5 percent in 10 years. That\u2019s better than zero,\u201d Acemoglu says.\n\u201cBut it\u2019s just disappointing relative to the promises that people in the industry and tech journalism are making.\u201d&nbsp;\nHe admitted that AI could take jobs. \u201cIt\u2019s going to impact a bunch of office jobs that are about data summary, visual matching, pattern recognition, etc.,\u201d Acemoglu adds.\nYet, \u201cwe\u2019re still going to have journalists, financial analysts, and HR employees.\u201d&nbsp;\nThe MIT professor also compared AI\u2019s ongoing effects to historical tech innovations, such as factory automation.\nIronically, people are more likely to adapt to artificial intelligence slower as it develops faster.&nbsp;\nAcemoglu argues that this technology should improve at a \u201cmore measured tempo\u201d so that people can catch up.&nbsp;\nNevertheless, the global economy\u2019s AI adoption \u201cwill naturally slow down\u201d as the \u201chype\u201d diminishes.&nbsp;\nMoreover, he says \u201cgovernment regulation has that role.\u201d However, he did not specify any long-term guidelines that the global economy might implement.\nLastly, Acemoglu explains that the world must have a clear vision of its objectives for AI development.&nbsp;\nYour subscription could not be saved.

In this interview, Chef Cza, who recently won the 2024 Mansmith Young Market Masters Awards (YMMA), shares with us her approach to market-driving strategy, product innovation and building a strong consumer brand.\nQuestion: What inspired you to choose avocado as the central ingredient for your product line, and how did you identify the market potential for avocado-based products?\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nAnswer: Avocado is my favorite fruit, and I\u2019ve always been amazed by its versatility and health benefits. In the Philippines, however, I noticed a significant lack of demand for avocados, leaving our local avocado farmers underappreciated. I identified the market potential by observing growing global trends toward healthier, plant-based foods and recognizing that there was an opportunity to elevate our farmers while meeting consumer demand for nutritious options. By engaging with potential customers and conducting informal surveys, I saw a genuine interest in healthy, avocado-based products that could fill the gap in the local market.\nFEATURED STORIES\nBUSINESS\nMore foreign brands seen coming to PH shores in 2025\nBUSINESS\nGlobal Dominion: Simplifying financing to empower every Filipino\nBUSINESS\nInternational group kicks off infrastructure investment drive for PH\nQ: Avocados were traditionally seen as a seasonal product. How have you managed to mitigate supply risk to ensure consistent availability year round?\nA: To ensure a steady supply of avocados throughout the year, we\u2019ve formed strong partnerships with local farmers as well as with the leading supplier. This collaboration allows us to source avocados directly from farmers, ensuring freshness while supporting local agriculture. We also implement careful planning and forecast demand, which helps us coordinate harvesting and distribution effectively, even during off seasons.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nQ: What challenges did you face in shifting consumer perceptions around avocado-based products, and how did you overcome them?\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nA: One of the main challenges was addressing misconceptions about avocado-based products, particularly the concerns surrounding organic ingredients and preservatives. To overcome this, we focused on transparency in our marketing. We shared the story of our sourcing process and highlighted that our products are 100-percent organic and free from preservatives. Engaging content on social media\u2014such as behind-the-scenes looks at our production and interactive discussions\u2014has helped educate our audience and build trust in our brand.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nREAD:\nPH sends maiden shipment of hass avocados to Japan\nQ: What has been your most popular product, and why do you think it resonates so well with your customers?\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nA: Our most popular product is the \u201cAvocado Lover\u201d dessert. It features a base of avocado ice cream paired with tapioca pearls, homemade biscuits and topped with mixed seeds, homemade condensed milk and fresh avocado chunks. This unique combination creates an explosion of flavors and textures that customers adore. I believe its success is due to the harmony of its ingredients and the innovative take on a classic dessert, which has captured the hearts\u2014and taste buds\u2014of many.\nQ: Avocadoria\u2019s offerings are unique in the market. How do you stay ahead of trends and continue to innovate in the food and beverage industry?\nA: At Avocadoria, we prioritize staying ahead of market trends through continuous research and development. By monitoring consumer preferences, emerging health trends and food innovations, we are able to adapt and refine our offerings. We also encourage feedback from our customers, which fuels our creativity and helps us understand what they want. This commitment to innovation ensures that we remain a leader in the avocado-based product space.\nQ: As a YMMA awardee, what advice do you have for aspiring food entrepreneurs who want to turn a passion into a scalable business?\nA: My advice would be to focus on three key areas:\nQuality: Ensure that your product or service stands out in terms of quality and offers something unique that isn\u2019t readily available in the market. Passion should drive innovation and the continual improvement of your offering.\nUnderstand the market: Conduct thorough market research to understand your target audience, competition and industry trends. This will allow you to position your product effectively and tailor your marketing strategies to reach your potential customers more effectively.\nPlan for scalability: This includes efficient production methods, scalable distribution channels and a flexible business model that can adapt to changes in the market or customer preferences.\nQ: How do you see Avocadoria growing in the next few years, and what\u2019s next for the brand?\nA: I envision Avocadoria experiencing significant growth in the coming years, with plans for international expansion.

        "content": "INQUIRER FILE PHOTO\nSoured loans held by local banks rose to their highest level in more than two years in October, as the start of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas\u2019 (BSP) rate-cutting cycle might have prompted banks to chase higher-yielding \u2014 but riskier \u2014 consumer credit.\nThe latest data from the BSP showed the gross amount of non-performing loan (NPL) \u2014 or credit that is 90 days late on a payment and at risk of default \u2014 cornered 3.60 percent of the total lending portfolio of the Philippine banking sector in October.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThat figure, called the gross NPL ratio, was the highest since the 3.75 percent recorded in May 2022. It was also larger than the previous month\u2019s ratio of 3.47 percent, data showed.\nFEATURED STORIES\nBUSINESS\nMore foreign brands seen coming to PH shores in 2025\nBUSINESS\nGlobal Dominion: Simplifying financing to empower every Filipino\nBUSINESS\nInternational group kicks off infrastructure investment drive for PH\nREAD:&nbsp;\nPH banks see lower bad debts in 2024\nIn peso terms, this means P524.31 billion out of the P14.55 trillion loan book of the entire local banking industry as of October had soured. That amount of NPLs was 16.66 percent higher compared with a year ago.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nAs it is, the proportion of bad debts held by banks has yet to return to the prepandemic level of 2.04 percent recorded at the end of 2019.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nLeonardo Lanzona, economist at Ateneo De Manila University, said the higher NPL ratio in October might have been a result of banks\u2019 \u201caggressive\u201d lending strategy amid the ongoing easing cycle of the BSP, which potentially increased their exposure to \u201crisky\u201d borrowers.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\n\u201dAs interest in loans became cheaper, lenders may have provided loans without robust risk assessments, thus resulting in lending to borrowers with low creditworthiness,\u201d he said.\nAt present, the benchmark rate that banks typically use as a guide when charging interest on loans stood at 6 percent following two quarter-point cuts each at the last August and October meetings of the Monetary Board. And a third reduction is likely on the table this month after the economy posted weaker-than-expected growth in the third quarter.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nBut beyond the rate cuts, Lanzona also said the powerful typhoons that hit the country in October and affected livelihoods might have made debt servicing more difficult for some borrowers.\nTo shield their balance sheets from credit losses, BSP figures showed banks set aside P487.52 billion as a provision for unpaid loans in October. That brought the NPL coverage ratio \u2014 a measure of the sufficiency of such buffer funds \u2014 at 92.98 percent, albeit lower than the 93.31 percent recorded in September.\nYour subscription could not be saved.

        "content": "Make America Great Again! (MAGA)\u201d\nSo goes the campaign slogan of reelected United States President Donald Trump. Interestingly, it isn\u2019t all that original since a similar one was used back in 1965 by then Sen. Ferdinand E. Marcos Sr. during his successful march to his first term as Philippine president.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nWith Trump\u2019s imminent assumption of office, the air is rife with speculations on how he would actually translate his campaign slogan into reality via specific programs, legislative proposals, and foreign policy. From the thrust of statements he\u2019s been making, it seems he intends to effect major structural policy and even sociopolitical changes on both the domestic and foreign affairs fronts. I will leave it to others to discuss sociopolitical matters, as those are more peculiar to American societal interaction that many others are more familiar with.\nFEATURED STORIES\nOPINION\nUrgent action needed vs online piracy as Congress session nears end\nOPINION\nLife has shortened\nOPINION\nThe gift of second chances\nSuffice it for me to observe, at the risk of being simplistic, that he appears determined to restore \u201ctraditional values,\u201d and put the brakes on the forward march of progressive liberalism particularly its so called \u201cwoke\u201d fringe. Somewhat associated with these are two of his highest priorities: securing US borders from the recent surge of illegal migrants, and rebalancing (as he sees it) the country\u2019s energy sector development strategy from a rapid headlong plunge into renewable energy dependence, toward a somewhat more gradual transition to that goal by restoring fossil fuel exploration, or as he puts it, \u201cDrill baby, drill.\u201d\nOn the domestic economic front, his game plan appears aimed at restoring dynamic economic growth by tax cuts and reduced government regulation. This, he hopes, would energize the private sector and put more disposable income in the pockets of the middle and working class, entrepreneurs, and corporations, thus creating jobs and hopefully, a virtuous cycle of higher employment rates that would broaden the tax base and generate a more positive budget outcome to meet the pressing financing needs of, among others, modernizing the country\u2019s infrastructure.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThe downside to this strategy is that the effect of tax cuts has a lag time during which already serious fiscal deficits may grow, resulting in even greater temptation to print money that will end up fueling inflation and escalating the level of national debt that even now threatens to become unmanageable. This latter vicious cycle outcome Trump hopes to stem by serious cuts in expenditure.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nSuch cuts appear to depend mainly on a draconian review of \u201cwasteful government expenditures\u201d by the envisioned new Department of Government Efficiency led by Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy. This involves the surgical trimming of perceived bloated bureaucracy in such agencies as the departments of education and of defense, and defense expenditure itself. The US defense budget is 10 times that of the next 10 countries in the world combined as it maintains 750 military bases in 80 countries. Furthermore, an announced centerpiece of Trump\u2019s foreign policy is to proactively encourage negotiations toward peace on all major war fronts, if only to carry the record of having no wars during his tenure.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nHowever, the bellicose side of his foreign policy, namely tariff drumbeating designed, it seems, to restore a more vibrant manufacturing sector to the US economy, could be problematic. He may find that his tendency toward breast beating may have to be balanced by his equally adept sense of the \u201cart of the deal\u201d toward win-win solutions in a world where BRICS\u2014a forum for cooperation among a group of emerging economies including Brazil, Russia, China and the United Arab Emirates\u2014is a serious reality rather than a pushover. As well, the evolution from a unipolar to a multipolar world order appears to be gaining momentum so that moves to preserve US trade and military dominance may have to be tempered with a wiser strategy of revitalizing US competitiveness toward winning the hearts and minds of the world\u2019s citizenry.\nAssuming things go reasonably well toward the MAGA scenario, what\u2019s in it for the Philippines? At the very least, a US economy averting pneumonia will help stabilize the value of the peso and continue the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas\u2019 already optimistic scenario of progressively lowering interest rates. There are also signs that the US is more interested in an investment-oriented, rather than a China-containment, policy with us, such that Musk is reportedly eyeing the Philippines as a significant center for his expanded Asian business operations. Under these circumstances, President Marcos would be well advised to lead in calming turbulent local political waters, refocusing on the country\u2019s economic priorities and comparative advantages, and dusting off his father\u2019s battle cry, \u201cThis nation can be great again.\u201d\nArticle continues after this advertisement\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\nRoberto F.

UHC aims to ensure that all individuals and communities receive the health services they need, whenever and wherever they are needed, without suffering financial hardship.\nWhile Republic Act No. 11223, or the Universal Health Care Act, encompasses a wide range of health services\u2014from preventive to palliative care\u2014it is crucial to recognize health promotion as a fundamental component to sustain this.\nHealth promotion, a strategy that prevents illness and addresses underlying social factors that make people sick, remains underutilized. Beyond improving health literacy and individual behavior through awareness and communication, it involves crafting and implementing policies and programs that promote healthy practices and discourage harmful ones. For instance, taxes on unhealthy products like tobacco and alcohol have been proven effective in reducing consumption and preventing related health issues.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nLast November, the Health Promotion Program at the University of the Philippines National Institutes of Health (NIH), alongside representatives from nine other Asian countries, was invited by the ThaiHealth Foundation to join a conference showcasing Thailand\u2019s transformative journey toward sustainable health as underpinned by robust health promotion interventions.

By focusing on root causes rather than symptoms, Thailand has shown the power of data-driven solutions.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nIn the Philippines, the UHC law has increased recognition of health promotion as a vital public health intervention. This is evident in expanded health promotion activities and investments at national and local levels guided by the Department of Health\u2019s Health Promotion Framework Strategy. However, challenges persist in the health promotion ecosystem, including limited resources, fragmented efforts, and weak integration with broader public policies.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThe Philippines can learn from Thailand\u2019s best practices in leveraging health promotion and disease prevention as foundational elements of UHC. Similar to Thailand, the DOH in collaboration with UP NIH, has established the Health Promotion Program to strengthen the generation of evidence.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nA key consideration for the future is fostering stronger collaboration among stakeholders to implement health-in-all policies. The Philippines can draw inspiration from ThaiHealth Foundation\u2019s role in guiding the government, the private sector, and communities toward health promotion goals driven by rigorous local evidence.\nHealth doesn\u2019t begin in a health clinic; it starts where people live, work, and play. While the tools are at our disposal, strong government and societal support are essential to turn them into action.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThailand\u2019s model offers valuable insights on integrating health promotion into the UHC framework and emphasizing evidence-based decision-making. By adapting these strategies to the local context, the Philippines can significantly advance toward UHC goals.

        "content": "As the festive season approaches, with its accompanying flurry of shopping sprees and holiday gatherings, one expectation looms large: traffic. But the state of traffic in Metro Manila this Christmas season has spiraled into a condition that can only be described as chaotic and intolerable, a cruel joke played on the millions who call this congested urban expanse home.\nRecent statistics indicate an alarming reality, with over 480,000 vehicles clogging the 23.8 km long EDSA daily \u2014a staggering increase compared to regular traffic volumes. At first glance, one might argue that this rise is just an anticipated seasonal step-up; however, it highlights something much more sinister at play: the ever-deteriorating state of our transportation infrastructure and city planning.\nStretching across the metropolis, EDSA remains a prime arterial road, yet during peak hours, it is often like a parking lot. It\u2019s a scene mirrored by multiple other national roads across the city\u2014C5, Commonwealth Avenue, Quezon Avenue, Rizal Ave. Sucat Road, Magsaysay Boulevard, Roxas Boulevard, and beyond, all succumbing to the same fate. Even roads leading to ramps leading toalso congested&nbsp; Skyway are no exception.&nbsp; &nbsp;These routes become impassable, turning commutes that should take mere minutes into hours-long odysseys filled with frustration and despair for those simply trying to get home from work or to family gatherings.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThe Manila Metropolitan Development Authority (MMDA), the agency entrusted with maintaining order on these vital \u201cNational\u201d roadways, seems utterly helpless against the escalating congestion. Their traffic operations are increasingly ineffective, with an evident lack of urgent response to a systemic problem that escalates every day. The failings do not stop there; local government units (LGUs) demonstrate a similar limbo of incompetence when it comes to control of flows in their management of secondary and tertiary roads where alternate routes should exist. Instead, motorist frustration rises as these designated alternatives become just as crammed as main roads due to an obvious lack of coordination and traffic management.\nFEATURED STORIES\nOPINION\nUrgent action needed vs online piracy as Congress session nears end\nOPINION\nLife has shortened\nOPINION\nThe gift of second chances\nPerhaps the most appalling sight is observed post-5 PM. As the sun begins to set, the commitment of MMDA enforcers evaporates, leaving weary commuters to fend for themselves in navigating the madness alone. This is intolerable and indicates the ineffective deployment of their resources during peak periods. This inconsistency breeds frustration and undermines public trust in our traffic management authorities. For instance, having a strategy to deploy additional personnel during heavy shopping seasons or critical events\u2014like Christmas\u2014particularly during \u201cnighttime\u201d. should be a no-brainer. Is it a problem of compensation and lack of funding? &nbsp;Whatever, their &nbsp;failure to deploy and serve the people on the road only suggests that an organization such as MMDA is clearly unprepared to execute its basic mandate.\nEven the Philippine National Police\u2019s traffic policemen seem absent when collisions occur, slow to respond to disputes and significantly hampered in their efforts to clear bottlenecks.&nbsp;\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nAlso, we must pressure local government units to re-examine their traffic flow strategies. Is there effective synchronization of traffic lights? Are secondary roads being utilized properly to divert traffic where necessary? Their local CCTVs can assist in swift identification of jams and prompt law enforcement actions.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThis pervasive problem goes beyond just traffic\u2014it signals a substantial failure in governance and urban planning. What makes matters worse is the apparent disdain of our authorities, who repeatedly promised solutions but provide no visible improvements. This relentless decline in mobility exasperates already congested lives, showcasing a clear disconnect between public sentiment and the bureaucratic response to the growing crisis.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThe effect of this traffic nightmare cascades through society. People arrive late for work, school, and essential appointments. School children miss classes, businesses lose revenue due to delayed deliveries, and the psychological strain on citizens is palpable. It is not merely an inconvenience; it\u2019s a detrimental blight on the quality of life that residents should rightfully expect. This inefficiency robs productivity and negatively impacts mental health, further pushing the narrative that we are living in a city nonchalantly overseen by mismanagement and neglect.\nAs we march into another holiday season, sparked with joy and wonder, imagine our retail establishments overwhelmed as customers flock to secure gifts and gather provisions. Yet, instead of unfettered access, they are met with gridlock; shopping frenzy quickly turn into vehicular purgatory, mirroring the frustrations felt year after year.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nWhat exacerbates this situation further is the prevailing lack of long-term strategic plans from our leaders. Where are the innovative solutions to improve public transport?\nIt is high time that the Philippine government acknowledges this dire predicament and acts decisively to address it\u2014not just with temporary fixes, but with sustainable solutions that will redefine urban mobility in Metro Manila.\nUrgent measures must be implemented. Moreover, decisive action should be taken against violators clogging the flow, improving, and enforcing regulations that prioritize public transport systems. What has happened to the non-contact apprehension laws that still pends in the Supreme Court?\nThis article isn\u2019t meant simply to lament over the state of traffic; it seeks to ignite a flame of urgency and purpose in saving Metro Manila from its present chaotic urban labyrinth.&nbsp; &nbsp;As we inch closer to the long-awaited Christmas season\u2014often associated with joy, family, and celebration\u2014let us also stir a collective movement towards a future where we are no longer prisoners of congestion.\nLet us make noise to push MMDA chairman Atty Romando Artes and PNP-HPG chief\nPB Gen William Sagun into creative action in solving this ongoing \u201cCarmageddon\u201d or \u201cCarpocalypse\u201d in all of our \u201cNational\u201d roads such as EDSA, C5 and others.&nbsp; Let us make noise so that the Metro Manila council headed by San Juan Mayor Francis Zamora, and every city mayor would task their respective LGU traffic enforcers to manage and solve the congested flows in \u201csecondary\u201d and \u201ctertiary\u201d roads, which are essentially their jurisdiction and prime responsibility.\nYour subscription could not be saved.

Velarde, chair of the Asian Institute of Journalism and Communication at Malaca\u00f1ang Palace on Friday. The \u201cmother of all Philippine maps\u201d has been cited as key evidence of the Philippine claims to the waters and other maritime features in the West Philippine Sea. \u2014Marianne Bermudez\nMANILA, Philippines \u2014 President Marcos could order the deployment of Philippine warships as a new policy option to respond to China\u2019s use of its own navy in its increasing aggression in the West Philippine Sea, but that decision is solely up to the Commander in Chief, a senior Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) officer said on Saturday.\nPCG spokesperson for the West Philippine Sea Commodore Jay Tarriela pointed out that the deployment of the People\u2019s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) ships \u201cwas now becoming part of the strategy of China in asserting their position in the West Philippine Sea,\u201d waters within the country\u2019s 370-kilometer exclusive economic zone (EEZ).\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nREAD:\nChina\u2019s PLA Navy shadows Philippine Coast Guard in West Philippine Sea\nFEATURED STORIES\nWWW\nLIVE UPDATES: Bar exam results 2024\nWWW\nTeodoro says petitions to cancel candidacy \u2018political maneuvering\u2019\nWWW\nLabor group seeks suspension of ballot printing for 2025 polls\nHe said that the deployment of Philippine warships \u201ccould be considered a reciprocal act\u201d since China was already doing it. Such a move is \u201cdependent on the Armed Forces of the Philippines on how they would like to come up with policy recommendation to strengthen our position in the West Philippine Sea,\u201d Tarriela said in a news forum.\n\u201cNow, if the question is if China is now deploying warships there, isn\u2019t it about time for us to deploy warships too?\u201d he asked.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\n\u201cI\u2019m not suggesting that we just deploy for the purpose of deploying warships,\u201d Tarriela said. \u201cWhat I said is it\u2019s up to the Commander in Chief and Armed Forces of the Philippines to come up with a policy recommendation to have the reciprocity of deployment.\u201d\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThe Philippines currently deploys \u201cwhite hulls,\u201d or coast guard vessels, not naval ships, for patrols and to perform law enforcement and other tasks in the West Philippine Sea to avoid militarizing the area.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThis policy has been in place since June 2012, when a Philippine Navy ship attempted to apprehend Chinese fishermen on eight vessels involved in digging up giant clams and corals and catching sharks illegally at Panatag (Scarborough) Shoal. They were blocked by other Chinese vessels until a two-month standoff eventually ended with China taking control of the atoll.\nThe Philippines maintains that is also adhering to the 2002 Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea between China and members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean), where they agreed not to escalate their maritime conflicts.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nChina lays sweeping claims to the South China Sea and has overlapping maritime claims with the Philippines, Vietnam, Brunei, and Malaysia.\nShadowing\n\u201cThe utilization of white ship in the West Philippine Sea is not something that President Marcos decided on his own. This has been our stand for the past three administrations already as a result of the 2012 standoff,\u201d Tarriela stressed.\nHis remarks followed the Dec. 4 shadowing of PCG vessels by Chinese PLAN near Panatag, also called Bajo de Masinloc. National Maritime Council spokesperson Alexander Lopez said it was the \u201cfirst time (they) came quite near and participated in the blocking or aggressive movements\u201d against PCG vessels.\nThe Chinese warship closely shadowed BRP Teresa Magbanua from a distance of only 270 meters while it attempted to approach a Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR) vessel.\nSideswiped\nAlso on the same day, a China Coast Guard (CCG) ship harassed the BRP Melchora Aquino, BRP Cape Enga\u00f1o, and the BFAR vessels that were deployed at Escoda (Sabina) Shoal. A CCG vessel with bow No. 3302 sideswiped BFAR\u2019s Datu Pagbuaya and fired its water cannon at it while it was conducting a routine patrol and delivering supplies to Filipino fishermen in the area.\nFormal protest\nThe Philippines filed a formal diplomatic protest against the Chinese actions.\nThe United States, the Philippines\u2019 treaty ally, and other countries also condemned China.\n\u201cThe PRC\u2019s (People\u2019s Republic of China) unlawful use of water cannons and dangerous maneuvers disrupted a Philippine maritime operation on December 4, putting lives at risk,\u201d American Ambassador MaryKay Carlson said in a statement on X.\n\u201cWe condemn these actions and stand with our like-minded friends, partners, and allies in support of a [Free and open Indo-Pacific],\u201d she said.\n\u2018No legal basis\u2019\nThe European Union, United Kingdom, Japan, France, Canada and Australia also expressed their concerns.\n\u201cWe oppose any threat of use of force contrary to international law and recall the importance of resolving disputes through dialogue. We recall the decision rendered by the Arbitral Court on July 12, 2016,\u201d the French Embassy in Manila said.\nThe 2016 arbitral award upheld Manila\u2019s sovereign rights to its EEZ in the western region, which includes Bajo de Masinloc, and rejected China\u2019s expansionist claim over the South China Sea for having \u201cno legal basis\u201d in international law.\nThe Chinese Embassy in Manila on Friday blasted the United States and its allies for expressing support to the Philippines, calling Carlson and the other countries \u201ctroublemakers to the peace and stability of the South China Sea.\u201d\n\u2018No right to interfere\u2019\n\u201cThe US Ambassador to the Philippines overlooked basic facts and made groundless accusations against China\u2019s legitimate measures for protecting its territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests.

So today, we offer our passengers seamless connectivity through a first-class suite out of Manila to the world,\u201d says Saeed Abdullah Miran, Emirates Philippines country manager.\nA recent checking of the Emirates online booking portal shows that a round trip first-class ticket from Manila to Dubai costs more than $5,000 aboard the Boeing 777 aircraft.

The next shops will open in Casablanca, Bangkok and Singapore.\nIt was in 1990 when Emirates started to service the Manila route. Now, it serves the country with 28 weekly flights, offering around 22,700 weekly seats to and from Dubai. In 2016, the airline included a circular service to Cebu and Clark.\n\u201cOur presence in Philippines is very strong.

(Associated Press Photo, File)\nTALLINN, Estonia \u2014 Gela Gogishvili and Haoyang Xu led a happy life as a gay couple in Russia, even as President Vladimir Putin\u2019s government took an increasingly anti-LGBTQ+ stance.\nTheir social media posts and videos drew thousands of followers, and they were greeted by them sometimes on the streets in Kazan, in Russia\u2019s Tatarstan region, where Gogishvili was a pharmacist and Xu, from China, studied international relations at a university.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nBut the online threats began after the Kremlin in December 2022 expanded its ban of \u201cpropaganda of nontraditional sexual relations\u201d from minors to adults, effectively outlawing any public endorsement of LGBTQ+ activities.

Now reunited in France, where they\u2019re seeking asylum, they look with concern at Russia, where new, even harsher anti-LGBTQ+ measures have been adopted.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nJust over a year ago, Russia\u2019s Supreme Court effectively outlawed any LGBTQ+ activism in a ruling that designated \u201cthe international LGBT movement\u201d as extremist. The move exposed anyone in the community or connected to it to criminal prosecution and prison, ushering in an atmosphere of fear and intimidation.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\n\u201cI\u2019m scared for the queer community in Russia that remains in the country,\u201d Gogishvili told The Associated Press.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nLinking LGBTQ+ rights to the war in Ukraine\nThat community in Russia has been under legal and public pressure for over a decade but especially since the Kremlin sent troops to Ukraine in 2022.

With the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in November 2023, anyone involved with the LGBTQ+ community could be imprisoned for up to six years.\nAs a result, many left the country. But others remain \u2013 and find themselves in a community pushed into the shadows, marginalized even further and dogged by fear of repression.\n\u201cSix years, it\u2019s not a joke,\u201d Olga Baranova, head of the Moscow Community Center for LGBT+ Initiatives, said in an interview from outside Russia. \u201c\u2019What is worth me going to prison for six years?\u2019 Every person who\u2019s doing something right now (in LGBTQ+ activism in Russia) has to answer this question these days.\u201d\nFILE PHOTO: A police officer detains a gay rights activist in Red Square in Moscow on Feb. 7, 2014. (Associated Press Photo/Evgeny Feldman, File)\nTargeting nightclubs, rainbow flags, and gay tourism\nJust days after the Supreme Court ruling, the LGBTQ+ community was rattled by news of police raiding gay bars, nightclubs and venues that hosted drag shows in Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities.\nLast spring, the first criminal case on charges of involvement with the \u201cLGBT movement\u201d extremist group was lodged against the owner and the staff of a bar in the southwestern city of Orenburg that held drag performances. A handful of similar cases came elsewhere.\nCharges have been launched for displaying symbols such as a rainbow flag \u2013 even though many of those accused had nothing to do with the LGBTQ+ community, said human rights lawyer Max Olenichev.\nMore raids of bars and nightclubs were reported in Moscow last month, almost exactly a year since the Supreme Court ruling. State media quoted law enforcement as saying they targeted those spreading \u201cLGBT propaganda.\u201d\nREAD:\nRussian LGBTQ+ museum closes after new law bans \u2018gay propaganda\u2019\nOne man arrested for allegedly running a travel agency for gay customers faces charges of organizing activities of an extremist organization. Independent news outlet Mediazona reported that Andrei Kotov rejected the charges and said in court that law enforcement officers beat him and administered electric shocks during the arrest, even though he didn\u2019t resist.\nOn Nov. 23, Putin signed into law a bill banning the adoption of Russian children by citizens of countries where gender-affirming care is legal. He also approved legislation outlawing the spread of material that encourages people not to have children.\n\u201cAll this, in general, speaks more about the desire of the authorities to create some kind of atmosphere of fear. It\u2019s not repressions, it\u2019s terror,\u201d said Vladimir, an LGBTQ+ rights advocate in Russia who like many interviewed by AP asked to be identified only by a first name out of security concerns.\nIkar, a fellow activist and transgender man, described the actions by authorities as \u201can attempt to intimidate \u2026 to make people lose their social connections, stay silent, stay home.\u201d\nGoing underground, online or abroad\nVladimir and Ikar belong to an underground LGBTQ+ rights group that offers legal aid and holds offline events without fanfare. Activists thoroughly verify identities of anyone seeking its help.\nThe group is seeing a growing number of cases related to violence against LGBTQ+ people, Vladimir said.\nSome regional organizations have shut down completely; others operate openly, but in a drastically different way. The Moscow Community Center for LGBT+ Initiatives moved its community-building efforts into a sprawling online network of chats and Zoom meeting rooms, according to Baranova.\n\u201cOur strategy today is to preserve the community in some form and size at least, for the people to just know each other, support each other,\u201d she said.\nCenter T, a prominent trans rights group, closed its Moscow shelter after visits from police and opened one in Yerevan, Armenia, said group leader Yan Dvorkin. Center T helps emigres as well as those still in Russia to find doctors and medical care, trying to resolve crises and still be a part of a community, if only online.\nAnna, a 25-year-old transgender woman in Moscow, said being part of the community provided the courage to transition. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine what it\u2019s like for new people, who are only opening up the possibility for themselves,\u201d she said.\nAnna transitioned and came out to her family and friends last year, after the ban on gender-affirming care was enacted.\nFILE PHOTO: Gay rights activists hold a banner reading \u201cHomophobia \u2013 the religion of bullies\u201d during a protest on Red Square in Moscow on July 14, 2013. (Associated Press Photo/Evgeny Feldman, File)\nThe ban and other repressive laws and rulings hit the already-vulnerable transgender community hard, Dvorkin said.\nFinding a job has become more difficult, both for those who haven\u2019t changed their gender marker in documents and those who have, he said. Access to gender-affirming medical care is a major issue, with doctors wary of working with transgender people and with many turning to shoddy underground medications.\nViolence against transgender people has spiked, as has harassment and discrimination, Dvorkin said.\n\u201cNowadays, you can intimidate people \u2013 blackmail them \u2013 by (saying) that \u2018I will report you and you will go to prison for extremism,\u2019\u201d the activist said.\nThose who stay in Russia, despite the risks\nAnna considers herself lucky and \u201cprivileged.\u201d She has a well-paying job, can afford a doctor advising her from abroad on hormonal therapy, and can get the medicine in Moscow. She wouldn\u2019t elaborate on how and where she gets it, so authorities \u201cdon\u2019t pull the plug.\u201d\nBut she said she hasn\u2019t come out to her colleagues for fear of losing her job, and she is sometimes harassed on the street because of her appearance. Her identity documents can\u2019t be changed under the ban.\nShe says she has a support network of friends and doesn\u2019t want to leave Russia, even though she\u2019s acutely aware of the risks.\n\u201cI somehow have managed to adapt,\u201d she said. \u201cI know how to live here.\u201d\nYulia, another transgender woman, also vowed to stay, describing it as sort of a mission to show that \u201cpeople like me are not necessarily weak, are not necessarily useless.\u201d\nIn her mid-40s, Yulia has a family and children, a successful career in a male-dominated industry, and the respect and acceptance from her colleagues and friends. For her, \u201cit\u2019s about normalizing\u201d being trans, she said.\nHow much \u201cnormalizing\u201d is possible in the current climate and the years ahead is still an open question.\nThe\nban on \u201cpropaganda of nontraditional sexual relations\u201d\nforces print, TV, and movie censorship of LGBTQ+ relations. In a recent example, two Russian streaming services cut a transgender character from the 1990 drama series \u201cTwin Peaks.\u201d\nAt the same time, there is abundant official rhetoric from politicians, the Russian Orthodox clergy and media figures condemning LGBTQ+ people.\nMany like Gela Gogishvili, the gay man who fled Russia last year, worry about the next generation of LGBTQ+ people.\nHe said he\u2019s \u201ceven more scared for those who are born there and are currently growing up -\u2013 from their childhood years onwards, they will be taught that (being queer) is bad.\u201d\nYour subscription could not be saved.

Associated Press\nCAPE TOWN, South Africa \u2014 President Joe Biden is finally making his long-promised visit to Africa this week, attempting to showcase a U.S.-backed railway project in three countries that he has pushed as a new approach in countering some of China\u2019s global influence.\nBiden\u2019s first visit to the continent as president \u2014 which he left to the very end \u2014 will highlight the Lobito Corridor railway redevelopment in Zambia, Congo and Angola. It aims to advance U.S. presence in a region rich in the critical minerals used in batteries for electric vehicles, electronic devices and clean energy technologies.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThat\u2019s a key field for U.S.-China competition and China has a stranglehold on Africa\u2019s critical minerals.\nFEATURED STORIES\nGLOBALNATION\nPCG: China using AIS spoofing to mislead public and stir confusion\nGLOBALNATION\nPH asserts rights over Bajo de Masinloc at UN General Assembly\nGLOBALNATION\n'Aid for Kristine-hit Batangas': Presidential assistance for farmers, fisherfolk, families\nA new strategy\nThe U.S. has for years built relations in Africa through trade, security and humanitarian aid. The 800-mile (1,300-kilometer), $2.5 billion railway upgrade is a different move and has shades of China\u2019s Belt and Road foreign infrastructure strategy that has surged ahead.\nREAD:\nBiden\u2019s promised visit to Africa shows no signs of happening yet\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThe Biden administration has called the corridor one of the president\u2019s signature initiatives.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nBiden starts a three-day trip to Angola on Monday, yet Lobito\u2019s future and any change in the way the United States engages with a continent of 1.4 billion leaning heavily toward China depends on the incoming administration of Donald Trump.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\n\u201cPresident Biden is no longer the story,\u201d said Mvemba Dizolele, the director of the Africa Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington-based think tank. \u201cEven African leaders are focused on Donald Trump.\u201d\nA fit for Trump\u2019s vision?\nThe U.S. has committed hundreds of millions of dollars to the Lobito Corridor alongside financing from the European Union, the Group of Seven leading industrialized nations, a Western-led private consortium and African banks.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\n\u201cA lot is riding on this in terms of its success and its replicability,\u201d said Tom Sheehy, a fellow at the United States Institute of Peace, a nonpartisan federal research institution.\nREAD:\nBiden fetes Kenyan leader as Africa competition grows\nHe called it one of the flagships for the G7\u2019s new Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment, which was driven by Biden and aims to reach other developing nations as a response to China\u2019s Belt and Road.\nBiden promised to visit Africa last year after reviving the U.S.-Africa Summit for the first time in nearly a decade in December 2022. The trip was kicked back to 2024 and delayed again this October because of Hurricane Milton, reinforcing a sentiment among Africans that their continent is still low priority. The last U.S. president to visit was Barack Obama in 2015.\n\u201cAfrica never gets top attention,\u201d said Witney Schniedman, an expert on African economic growth at the nonprofit Brookings Institution.\nBut many are optimistic that the Lobito project, which isn\u2019t due for completion until well after Biden has left office, will survive a change of administration and be given a chance. It goes some way to blunting China, which has bipartisan backing and is high on Trump\u2019s to-do list.\n\u201cAs long as they keep labeling Lobito one of the main anti-China tools in Africa, there is a certain likelihood that it\u2019s going to keep being funded,\u201d said Christian-G\u00e9raud Neema, who analyzes China-Africa relations.\nSome success in Africa\nThe Lobito Corridor will be an upgrade and extension of a railway line from the copper and cobalt mines of northern Zambia and southern Congo to Angola\u2019s Atlantic Ocean port of Lobito, a route west for Africa\u2019s critical minerals.\nIt\u2019s little more than a starting point for the U.S. and its partners, because China is dominant in the mining in Zambia and Congo. Congo has more than 70% of the world\u2019s cobalt, most of which is heading to China to reinforce its critical mineral supply chain that the U.S. and Europe have to rely on.\nLobito was made possible by some American diplomatic success in Angola that led to a Western consortium winning the bid for the project in 2022 ahead of Chinese competition, a surprise given Angola\u2019s long and strong ties with Beijing. China financed a previous redevelopment of the railway.\nThe Biden administration accelerated American outreach to Angola, turning around what was an antagonistic relationship three decades ago when the U.S. armed anti-government rebels in Angola\u2019s civil war. U.S.-Angola trade was $1.77 billion last year, while the U.S. has a stronger stake in regional security through a strategic presence on the Atlantic Ocean, and Angolan President Jo\u00e3o Louren\u00e7o\u2019s role mediating in a conflict in eastern Congo.\nIn Angola, Biden will announce new developments on health, agribusiness, security cooperation as well as the Lobito Corridor, White House officials said on a preview call with reporters.\nThe visit, the first by a sitting U.S. president to Angola, will \u201chighlight that remarkable evolution of the U.S.-Angola relationship,\u201d Frances Brown, a special assistant to the president and senior director for African affairs at the National Security Council, said on a separate call.\nIt will also draw attention to a perennial challenge for America\u2019s value-based diplomacy in Africa. International rights groups have used Biden\u2019s trip to criticize the Louren\u00e7o government\u2019s authoritarian shift. Political opponents have been imprisoned and allegedly tortured, while security and other laws have been passed in Angola that severely restrict freedoms, throwing some scrutiny on Washington\u2019s new African partnership.\nWill the US really show up?\nThose calling for more U.S. presence in Africa say Angola and the Lobito spinoff show what might be achieved, even with China-facing countries, if the U.S. is willing to consistently engage. But they see signs for Africa when China has held a summit with African leaders every three years since 2000, while the US has had just two summits, in 2014 and 2022, and there are no plans for the next one.\nMichelle Gavin, a former U.S. ambassador to Botswana and adviser on Africa to Obama, said that the U.S. had failed to take Africa seriously over multiple administrations, a bipartisan trend. She doesn\u2019t see Biden\u2019s visit and Lobito being a major \u201cinflection point\u201d that will drive a new U.S. focus across Africa.\nYour subscription could not be saved.

        "content": "ILLUSTRATION BY RUTH MACAPAGAL\nBesides being the founder and global group chair of my worldwide strategy and management consulting company, I have also been a graduate executive MBA professor for more than 13 years. I know that many of the most important keys to success are not taught at business school. One of them is how to create a great network.\nGrowing up in a small town in Germany, my family didn\u2019t have much. We weren\u2019t wealthy, and money was a constant concern. I wasn\u2019t born with a silver spoon or a vast network. Instead, I built my global network from scratch. Now I am regularly interacting with or advising heads of state, Nobel laureates, Fortune 500 CEOs, some of the world\u2019s wealthiest business owners and many of the world\u2019s most famous business leaders. How did I pull that off? My journey taught me that\u2014besides expertise and unique skills\u2014reputation and trust are the most important.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThe foundation of success: Reputation and trust\nAll of the clients of my global strategy and management consulting company go through a due diligence process and background checks before we take them on. We are in the fortunate position that we can choose who to work with and regularly turn requests away.\nFEATURED STORIES\nBUSINESS\nMore foreign brands seen coming to PH shores in 2025\nBUSINESS\nGlobal Dominion: Simplifying financing to empower every Filipino\nBUSINESS\nInternational group kicks off infrastructure investment drive for PH\nRecently, we discovered that one of our new prospects, a family business owner, despite maintaining a good public reputation, has questionable ethical standards. This individual has a pattern of engaging in unethical practices whenever he believes he can get away with it, disregarding clear agreements.\nIn business, your reputation is your most valuable asset. It precedes you in every room, opening doors that would otherwise remain closed. Trust is the currency of this reputation. It\u2019s what turns introductions into partnerships and handshake deals into long-term relationships.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nA handshake should carry the same weight as a signed contract, and a verbal agreement should be as binding as one certified by lawyers. For instance, a family business we work with, which has thrived for 55 years and serves hundreds of millions of consumers worldwide, entrusts us with its most confidential financial details without even requiring a nondisclosure agreement. This level of trust demonstrates that reputation and integrity form the backbone of business relationships.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nEthics as a competitive edge\nEthical behavior in business is often viewed as a moral responsibility, but its practical benefits cannot be overstated. High ethical standards are not just about adhering to laws or regulations; they serve as a unique competitive edge in the marketplace. Companies and leaders known for their integrity attract top-tier talent, loyal customers and trustworthy business partners. These stakeholders are more likely to invest their time, energy and resources in organizations they perceive as ethical and dependable.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nA strong commitment to ethics creates a culture of accountability and transparency within the organization. Employees feel safe and empowered when they work for a leader who values honesty over shortcuts. This sense of trust fosters innovation, collaboration and long-term employee retention. For example, one of our long-standing clients\u2014a multigenerational family business\u2014has continuously expanded into new markets while maintaining an impeccable reputation for ethical dealings. This reputation has not only attracted lucrative partnerships but also positioned the business as a trusted leader in its industry, ensuring its sustainability over decades.\nMoreover, ethical behavior often translates into better decision-making. Leaders who prioritize long-term relationships and sustainable growth over immediate profits avoid the pitfalls of hasty, ill-conceived decisions. They cultivate trust within their ecosystems, which acts as a buffer in times of crisis. Ethical businesses are less likely to face reputational damage or costly legal battles, giving them a competitive advantage over peers who choose to cut corners.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nLessons from the fallen\nHistory is littered with examples of leaders and companies brought to their knees by unethical behavior. These cautionary tales highlight that success achieved through dishonesty is rarely sustainable and that the costs of unethical decisions often far outweigh their short-term benefits.\nConsider the downfall of Enron, a company once hailed as one of America\u2019s most innovative enterprises. Its executives engaged in fraudulent accounting practices, inflating profits to maintain investor confidence. When the truth emerged, Enron filed for bankruptcy, erasing thousands of jobs and wiping out billions in shareholder value.\nAnother example is the Volkswagen emissions scandal. The company deliberately installed software in millions of cars to cheat emissions tests, allowing it to market vehicles as environmentally friendly when they were anything but. The scandal cost Volkswagen billions in fines, lawsuits and vehicle recalls, and it severely damaged brand reputation. Rebuilding that trust has been a long and arduous journey for Volkswagen, underscoring the heavy price of unethical shortcuts.\nThese cases demonstrate that the ripple effects of unethical decisions extend far beyond financial loss. They destroy careers, tarnish reputations and leave organizations struggling to regain public trust. For leaders, the takeaway is clear: shortcuts in ethics may provide temporary gains, but they often lead to irreversible damage.\nThe fragility of success\nSuccess in business is fragile. Most companies are only one or two major strategic decisions away from total failure. A lapse in ethical judgment can be one such misstep, with far-reaching consequences. It\u2019s crucial to maintain high ethical standards, even when faced with challenging decisions.\nLeaders who cut corners or bend the rules often rationalize their actions by assuming no one will notice. However, word spreads quickly in the business community. When trust is eroded, opportunities disappear, and partnerships dissolve. Worse, leaders who operate unethically may not realize the damage until it\u2019s too late, as few are willing to confront them directly.\nThe ripple effect of leadership\nUnethical behavior at the top doesn\u2019t stay contained; it trickles down through the organization. As the leader, your actions set the tone for your company culture. If you compromise on ethics, it sends a message that dishonesty and cutting corners are acceptable. This behavior can lead to a toxic environment where employees feel justified in bending the rules.\nOn the flip side, leaders who uphold integrity inspire their teams to do the same. Ethical leadership fosters a culture of accountability, transparency and mutual respect, which in turn drives innovation and growth.\nFive to thrive\n\u2022 Prioritize integrity in\nevery decision\n\u2022 Cultivate a culture of trust\n\u2022 Invest in long-term relationships\n\u2022 Learn from failures in ethics\n\u2022 Implement ethical accountability systems INQ\nYour subscription could not be saved.

(Photo from Jiji Press)\nAn increasing number of Japanese companies operating in China are transferring their production bases to countries in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean).\nThis comes as Chinese economic growth slows and concerns rise over the risks of doing business in China, where foreign residents have been arrested on vague grounds.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThe Chinese economy is stagnating, and this can clearly be seen in production, consumption and investments. The country\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) for the second quarter (April-June) of 2024 grew 4.7% year over year, which was 0.6 points lower than the first quarter (January-March). Economic data from August shows that retail business sales, an indicator of consumption trends, grew only 2.1% year over year.\nFEATURED STORIES\nBUSINESS\nMore foreign brands seen coming to PH shores in 2025\nBUSINESS\nGlobal Dominion: Simplifying financing to empower every Filipino\nBUSINESS\nInternational group kicks off infrastructure investment drive for PH\nREAD:\nPH, US, Japan agree vs \u2018economic coercion\u2019\nThe slump in the real estate industry is a major factor behind this. The real estate market and related industries make up a fourth of China\u2019s GDP, but investments in real estate development fell 10.2% year over year in the period between January and August 2024.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, China implemented a \u201cZero-COVID Strategy,\u201d which kept citizens indoors, dealt a major blow to the tourism and restaurant industries, and led to investments being concentrated in real estate. Home prices rose exponentially.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nIn response, the Chinese government placed heavy restrictions on risky deals. This caused home prices to drop drastically, and the businesses of many major real estate developers declined. Down payments were made, but buildings never got built, and as similar cases followed one after another, the consumption trend cooled among the population.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nFurthermore, the Chinese government, which places utmost importance on national security, established the Counter Espionage Law in 2014. This has resulted in many foreigners, including Japanese, being arrested for \u201cespionage acts,\u201d which are only vaguely defined.\nStarting in July 2024, new regulations have been implemented that allow authorities to inspect the contents of electronic devices of individuals and organizations for acts of espionage, raising further concerns that even regular economic activities could be scrutinized. With little hope for significant growth in the Chinese market, coupled with the risks of doing business in China, direct international investments into the country fell 29.1% year over year between January and June 2024. There are also other issues, such as the risk of high tariffs on products produced in China and exported to the USA due to the ongoing tension between the two countries, as well as rising labor costs in China.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nAgainst this backdrop, Japanese companies are turning their eyes to Southeast Asia for new bases of production. In January 2023, Sony transferred the manufacturing of its cameras for Japan, Europe and the USA from China to Thailand. Its factories in China now only make products to be sold domestically, allowing it to reduce dependency on the country.\nKyocera also plans to transfer a part of its electric tool production in China to Vietnam in fiscal 2024. The Vietnam site will mainly manufacture products to be sold in the USA to avoid the tariffs placed on exports from China.\nAccording to Teikoku Databank, the number of Japanese companies operating in China decreased from 14,394 in 2012 to 13,034 in 2023. Many companies are choosing to relocate back to Japan or Southeast Asia. This can be seen in how Southeast Asian countries now occupy three of the top five locations in terms of the number of Japanese companies\u2019 overseas subsidiaries: No. 1 is China, followed by USA, Thailand, Singapore, and Vietnam.\nREAD:\nMore Asean nations offer help on South China Sea issue\nSoutheast Asia is attractive in many ways for Japanese companies. Not only is it geographically close to Japan but it also offers a rich pool of human resources with technical prowess and fluency in many languages including English, which allows companies to secure a stable labor force. Many Asean countries also have highly transparent fiscal policies and stable currency exchange rates. Cities have established solid infrastructure such as electrical power and transportation networks, making it easier for companies to build factories there and secure supply chains, from production and distribution to sales.\nThe Southeast Asian market is very appealing. The 10 Asean countries have a combined population of around 670 million people. It tops the population of the European Union (EU), which is around 450 million people and is the third largest in the world after India and China. The median age is also young, and unlike many developed nations, the region has not yet been faced with the issue of an aging society with a low birthrate.\nThe 2023 nominal GDP of the 10 Asean countries combined rose to around 3.81 trillion US dollars, which ranks right after the USA, China, Germany and Japan. It is forecast to overtake Japan\u2019s GDP by 2030. Due to the effects of an aging population and low birthrate, there are concerns that Japan\u2019s market and labor force will shrink going forward. Japanese companies will benefit greatly from operating and expanding their businesses in Southeast Asia, which has a large market, offers rich human resources and is referred to as \u201cthe world\u2019s growth center.\u201d\nForeign ministers of Asean, Japan, China and South Korea. (Photo by Jiji Press)\nJapan and Asean countries have established various cooperative partnerships in politics, foreign policy and the economy. Japan is an active participant in numerous Asean foreign policy and security frameworks, including the East Asia Summit (EAS), which started in Malaysia in 2005, Asean Regional Forum (ARF), which discusses political and security issues, and Asean Defense Ministers\u2019 Meeting Plus (ADMM-Plus), the only formal meeting of defense ministers in the Asia-Pacific region. In 2020, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) was officially signed, including Japan, China, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand in addition to Asean. Building an open economic sphere by providing market access and establishing economic rules is accelerating active free trade, including small and medium-sized businesses.\nWhile Southeast Asia is attractive to Japan, Japan must also be attractive to Southeast Asia. Southeast Asian company managers often say that decision-making is slow in Japanese businesses. They say this is due to a uniquely Japanese custom where multiple meetings are needed to make a single decision, and everyone has to then wait for it to be approved by the head office in Japan. Furthermore, Southeast Asians who grew up loving Japanese brands and anime are already in their 40s and 50s, while the attention of the younger generation, which is driving consumption, has been turning to South Korean and Chinese cultures as well. As such, greater efforts must be made to ensure that Southeast Asia will choose Japan as a partner.\nLast year, Japan and Asean celebrated their 50th anniversary of cooperative partnerships. The relationship, in fact, began as one of animosity. Japan drew the ire of Southeast Asia by exporting massive quantities of cheap synthetic rubber to Asean, a producer of natural rubber, and that led to the holding of the Asean-Japan forum on synthetic rubber in 1973.\nYour subscription could not be saved.

It was a perfect example of the proverb \u201cAfter rain comes fair weather.\u201d One could call 2024 the first year of the next half-century of new cooperative partnerships. Going forward, Japan\u2019s efforts will determine how strong this partnership with Asean will become.\nREAD NEXT\nSafe manufacturer investing P1.5B for Pampanga plant\nShareholders\u2019 agreement\nEDITORS' PICK\nFilipino film \u2018Haligi\u2019 considered for Golden Globes\nP40 per kilo rice now available in more public markets\nClimate change intensified back-to-back PH storms \u2013 study\nDOH: Undiagnosed HIV cases contribute to spread of virus\n2 PH enterprises recognized as Asia's best innovators\nSOCIAL CLIMATE: Life has shortened\nMOST READ\nComelec exempts 48 projects from election ban\nLorraine Badoy after red-tagging civil suit loss: \u2018Fight isn\u2019t over\u2019\nBar exam 2024: List of successful examinees\n3 schools have highest percentage of passers among first-time bar exam takers\nFollow\n@FMangosingINQ\non Twitter\n-->\nView comments",

        "content": "Illustration by Ruth Macapagal`\nToday the old adage \u201cchange is the only constant\u201d has never rung truer. As the founder of a global strategy and management consulting firm, I recently encountered a financial services giant that starkly illustrated a critical pitfall facing large organizations today\u2014the peril of bureaucratic rigidity.\nWhen my team and I engaged with this behemoth, we were met with an organization so entrenched in its ways, so beholden to outdated processes, that it was clear they were on a trajectory toward obsolescence. Despite their size, their inability to adapt swiftly to market changes made us question whether our efforts could truly effect the necessary transformation.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThis encounter is not unique. Many large organizations fall into the trap of becoming slaves to their own processes. What starts as a framework to ensure efficiency and consistency morphs into a monolithic barrier to innovation and agility. This rigidity can be fatal, particularly in an era where flexibility and speed often trump sheer scale.\nFEATURED STORIES\nBUSINESS\nMore foreign brands seen coming to PH shores in 2025\nBUSINESS\nGlobal Dominion: Simplifying financing to empower every Filipino\nBUSINESS\nInternational group kicks off infrastructure investment drive for PH\nThe hidden cost of bureaucracy\nHistorically, we\u2019ve seen giants topple due to their inability to adapt. Kodak, for example, clung to traditional film while the world embraced digital photography. Similarly, Blockbuster failed to pivot in the face of streaming technology, allowing Netflix to revolutionize home entertainment.\nThe crux of the issue lies in a fundamental shift in the business environment. Economies of scale, once a significant advantage, are no longer the primary determinant of success. Today\u2019s winners are those who can pivot quickly, innovate constantly and remain agile in the face of change. Companies like Amazon, with its \u201cDay One\u201d mentality, exemplify this approach, constantly reinventing themselves to stay ahead.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThe cultural element of innovation vs. bureaucracy\nOne major advantage of my company being global is the diverse perspective we bring to each client. My team and I blend a broad, global outlook with an intimate understanding of local cultures. This unique combination allows us to frame problems and challenges within a proper global context, crafting solutions that elevate our clients to the next level with ease and speed.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nDifferent cultures around the world naturally foster either an innovation mindset or a bureaucratic one. The United States, for example, is renowned for its pragmatic, entrepreneurial approach, contributing to Silicon Valley\u2019s status as a global innovation hub. This region marries Californian playfulness with a business mindset, creating a fertile ground for tech giants.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nIn contrast, countries like Germany, Switzerland and some Southeast Asian nations such as the Philippines, lean towards bureaucratic tendencies, making it challenging for larger organizations to embrace agility.\nThe Middle East, though evolving with innovation hubs like Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Saudi Arabia, generally remains rooted in traditional corporate structures. However, these countries are now prioritizing innovation, with Oman serving as a contrasting example where traditional mindsets still contribute to bureaucratic tendencies.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nOur global insight, coupled with local expertise, empowers us to navigate these cultural nuances. We understand how an innovation-friendly environment can be a game-changer for our clients. By recognizing and adapting to these cultural differences, we can devise strategies that foster innovation and agility, propelling our clients toward success in a complex, interconnected world.\nExamples of successful turnarounds\nMy team and I have turned many slow dinosaurs into agile jaguars. If you know how, it is definitely possible. Companies can successfully rejuvenate themselves by embracing a startup mentality.\nThe global business landscape is full of many successful examples. For instance, Microsoft underwent a cultural shift under Satya Nadella\u2019s leadership, breaking down silos and fostering a more collaborative, innovative environment. Similarly, Ford revitalized its culture by focusing on transparency and lean decision-making, transforming from a legacy automaker into a more agile company.\nMy team and I have seen that even the most established organizations can avoid the pitfalls of bureaucracy with the right leadership and strategy. The key lies in fostering a culture that values speed, collaboration, and continuous innovation.\nA case study: Bureaucracy in action\nWe once had a client, a successful billionaire business owner, who envisioned a groundbreaking deal poised to catapult his company to new heights. However, as the proposal moved through various departments, the layers of bureaucracy began to distort the original vision. Each department added its own requirements and procedures, creating a complex web of red tape that deviated from the owner\u2019s intent. The deal, once promising, was on the brink of collapse due to this bureaucratic quagmire.\nIf you suspect that your company has fallen prey to the silent killer of bureaucracy, it\u2019s crucial to take decisive action. Begin by conducting a thorough audit of your processes to identify bottlenecks and redundancies. Encourage open communication across departments to ensure alignment with the company\u2019s core objectives. Empower employees to challenge inefficient practices and propose innovative solutions.\n\u200b\u200bSimilarly, Nokia offers another cautionary tale. Once a leader in mobile phones, Nokia failed to adapt quickly to the smartphone revolution, clinging to outdated systems and processes. This bureaucratic inertia allowed competitors like Apple and Samsung to overtake Nokia, which struggled to regain relevance.\nYour \u2018Five to Thrive\u2019\nIn the modern business environment, agility, not size, determines success. Bureaucracy can be a silent assassin, stifling the very dynamism that fuels growth. By prioritizing flexibility, empowering employees, and embracing innovation, business leaders can ensure their organizations not only survive but thrive in the long term.\nYour subscription could not be saved.

I agree to the\nTerms of Use\nand acknowledge that I have read the\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nSo, how can business leaders avoid the trap of bureaucratic stagnation? Here are five practical steps:\nPrioritize flexibility over rigidity. Foster a culture that values adaptability. Encourage employees at all levels to challenge the status quo and propose improvements.\nStreamline processes. Regularly review and refine workflows to eliminate redundancies. Keep structures lean to maintain agility.\nEmpower decision-making. Decentralize authority to enable faster responses. Train teams to make informed decisions without excessive oversight.\nEncourage innovation. Advocate for a fail-fast approach, where experimentation is rewarded, and learning from failures is part of the process. Encourage cross-functional collaboration to spark creative solutions.\nLeverage technology. Embrace new technologies to streamline operations and gain a competitive edge.

        "content": "SEOUL\u2014As Israel proceeds with a ground offensive against Hezbollah, the situation in the Middle East continues to deteriorate, with the prospects for ending the war dim, and the number of lives lost escalating. Absent this time is US intervention to manage the crisis. Has the international order led by the United States since the end of the Cold War collapsed?\nMost analyses, including that of New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman, have pierced the essence of the current Middle East conflict as a struggle between the \u201ccoalition of inclusion\u201d and the \u201ccoalition of resistance.\u201d But they overlook one crucial element: the importance of domestic politics.\nIn Israel, this centers on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who faces responsibility for failing to prevent last year\u2019s surprise attack by Hamas. Over 41,615 Palestinians, mostly civilians, have died in Gaza due to Israeli military actions, adding to his burden. Israel, once seen as a victim of the Holocaust, is now increasingly viewed as a perpetrator of war crimes.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nNetanyahu also faces legal issues related to corruption charges. Given these circumstances, he may feel the need to secure an image of overwhelming victory to push for an end to the war. Otherwise, a conclusion to the war could signal the beginning of him being found legally or politically accountable. Thus, it\u2019s natural to suspect that Israel\u2019s provocative military actions against Hamas, Iran and Hezbollah may be driven more by Netanyahu\u2019s personal political interests than by the broader struggle between the teams of \u201cinclusion\u201d and \u201cresistance.\u201d\nFEATURED STORIES\nOPINION\nUrgent action needed vs online piracy as Congress session nears end\nOPINION\nLife has shortened\nOPINION\nThe gift of second chances\nIran\u2019s domestic politics show a different picture. Its missile attack toward Israel on Tuesday might be interpreted as a skillfully compromised operation. The attack comes belatedly as retaliation for the death of Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah, killed on Sept. 27, and of Ismail Haniyeh, the Hamas leader assassinated on July 31. The strike was more a show of force rather than angling for real damages because Iran is aware that most of the missiles would be intercepted by Israel\u2019s Iron Dome.\nIran\u2019s halfway response implies that Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, who is representing the reformists, has a voice in the decision-making process, and is trying to avoid a full-scale war with Israel and improve relations with the US.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nDomestic politics in the US also contribute to the situation in the Middle East, with the US\u2019 inability to act possibly influenced by the strong pro-Israel lobby within the country. However, the national security guidelines of its Indo-Pacific strategy might also be a significant factor. While this strategy aligns with the general American public\u2019s displeasure with China, it has led to a perception that issues in other areas are of secondary importance. As a result, misunderstandings about the US\u2019 global role have spread, leading to neglect in dealing with other regions.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThis neglect has erupted in various crises, such as Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and Israel\u2019s continued military operations. The Indo-Pacific strategy, which harms US hegemony and reputation, was a product of domestic political focus. After winning in 2016, then President Donald Trump boosted his popularity by noting that contradictions in the US economy and society stem from cheap Chinese products and illegal immigrants. As a result, China-bashing became a political trend no US politician could resist. Even the Biden administration had to adopt a foreign policy focused on checking China to survive in the domestic political arena.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nBy reconstructing the Middle East situation through the lens of domestic politics in the US, Israel and Iran, one can derive a somewhat different picture from Friedman\u2019s grand narrative that the clash between the \u201ccoalition of inclusion\u201d and \u201ccoalition of resistance\u201d is inevitable. The cohesion within both camps is weak, and painting Iran, Iraq, or Hezbollah as villains does not help, nor is it necessary to argue that eliminating them would connect the Asia-Pacific and Europe.\nWhile understanding the rivalry between Friedman\u2019s coalitions of inclusion and resistance is important for comprehending and resolving the Middle East crisis, it is equally critical to account for the changes, if not distortions, caused by domestic politics. This perspective allows us to urge the US to adopt and implement a global-scale strategy focusing on universal values and norms, rather than a China-centered regional response like the Indo-Pacific strategy. Additionally, it is essential to pressure Netanyahu to abandon his reckless war initiatives and instead champion strategies for peace and coexistence in Israel and the wider Middle East.&nbsp;\n\u2014The Korea Herald/Asia News Network\nArticle continues after this advertisement\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nThe Philippine Daily Inquirer is a member of the Asia News Network, an alliance of 22 media titles in the region.\nYour subscription could not be saved.

        "content": "Wine Drop is on a mission to make more people drink wine. Their strategy? Make it more fun\n\u201cWe have a big crisis in wine globally. There\u2019s too much wine, and people are drinking less.\u201d\nWhen we met with Wine Drop\u2019s managing director Jean-Philippe Guillot, he dropped this sobering yet unfortunately long-standing fact. There has been a downward trend in wine consumption globally since 2018, and the most recent estimate by the\nInternational Organization of Vine and Wine\nnoted that 2023 consumption was the lowest volume they\u2019ve recorded since 1996.\nDespite the decreased\ndemand\nin European and Western wine-drinking countries (and even China), it\u2019s surprising to see that the wine market is actually growing in the Philippines.\nIn 2022, the country was noted to be one of the \u201cmost exciting wine markets,\u201d thanks to the continued increase in wine consumption here. However, there\u2019s still much work to be done.\nFor wine distributors like AWC, of which Wine Drop is under, tickling Filipinos\u2019 taste buds for wine is proving to be a reliable strategy.&nbsp;\nWine Drop is AWC\u2019s retail component, providing spaces for consumers to directly purchase, drink, and even learn more about the wines they carry.&nbsp;\nSince 2014, AWC has been known for supplying quality wine to some of the country\u2019s top hotels, resorts, and restaurants, such as the Shangri-la group, Grand Hyatt, Fairmont, Raffles, Dusit Thani as well as Solaire and Okada.\n\u201cWine was not really in the culture of the Philippines, so a lot of restaurants didn\u2019t really have a wine list. A lot of Filipinos are also traveling the world, and of course they get into wine more. So our first mission was really to bring good quality wine from around the globe and help restaurants\nbuild their wine list\n,\u201d Guillot says.\nBut after years of showcasing their wines at partner restaurants and online resellers, the group realized the need for a platform or space where customers could buy bottles directly. \u201cIt was a bit frustrating that there\u2019s no shop to showcase our wine for people. If they enjoyed [the] wine in a restaurant, they don\u2019t really know where to buy it for their home. So that was our first motivation, to have a place where people can find all the wine.\u201d\nThe pandemic also played a major role in AWC\u2019s decision to establish Wine Drop. \u201cBecause most of our customers were hotels and restaurants and they were all closed during COVID, we had a lot of stock of wine,\u201d Guillot says. Thus their website winedrop.life was created.\nSoon after, Wine Drop ventured into putting up a physical space in Greenhills. Guillot describes the neighborhood as one that is \u201cdynamic\u2026 with people who love F&amp;B.\u201d\nAfter a year in Greenhills, Wine Drop ventured into a second location, this time in Makati, along the strip of warehouses at Chino Roces Extension. The decision to open here came with two-fold benefits: As primarily a wine importer, having both a shop and a warehouse space was crucial. The warehouse, which they keep cold at a controlled temperature of 16 to 17 degrees every day, ensures that the wine they carry will maintain its quality.\n\u201cWine is a product that\u2019s still alive,\u201d Guillot says. \u201cIf you don\u2019t take care of it, it will turn into vinegar. That\u2019s not what it\u2019s supposed to be.\u201d\nFilipinos and wine\nWhile the Philippines is still not a major wine market, it is showing great promise especially in recent years. Guillot attributes this to the rapidly changing F&amp;B landscape in the country.\n\u201cFilipinos usually eat and then drink after. In France, you eat and drink at the same time. It\u2019s two different cultures. But when you look at these new fantastic restaurants opening with a new chef generation, when you look at all these new\nsommeliers\nor bartenders who have worked abroad and are coming back to the Philippines, they bring what they learned abroad. That\u2019s what makes Manila unique, I think, and very impressive in terms of new concepts,\u201d Guillot says.\n\u201cThis new generation of Filipinos are so passionate about wine,\u201d he says. \u201cI know a lot of them, and their passion is wine, to taste wine. I think you have this big dynamic market where people enjoy going out and drinking good stuff as well.\u201d\nJean-Philippe Guillot\nAmong the wines that has been in Wine Drop\u2019s rotation the longest is this wine from Chateau Cap de Fer.\nWith this growing interest in wine, Wine Drop\u2019s mission is to further cultivate that interest.&nbsp;\n\u201cWine could sound intimidating for some people. Not everyone\u2019s going to go to a five-star hotel [to drink wine], and when you open the wine list, it\u2019s very hard to choose,\u201d Guillot says. \u201cAt Wine Drop, we wanted to have a nice place that\u2019s engaging and easy to come in. The idea of Wine Drop is really to make a wine shop that is accessible.\u201d\nAt the Makati shop, the wines are classified by taste profile, instead of price or country of origin. Their featured wines come in a wide range of prices, the cheapest bottles falling below P1,000, with the most expensive ones priced at around P20,000. But with taste as the priority at Wine Drop, customers can browse the shelves themselves, ranging from light, medium, and heavy reds to light and crisp and even acidic whites.\nAround 75 percent of the shop\u2019s selection are red wines, as Filipinos mostly prefer red wines.\nREAD:\nA natural wine education by way of three new bars\nAll members of Wine Drop\u2019s shop staff are also knowledgeable about wines, happily providing recommendations based on customer preferences.\nGuillot himself is very hands-on, having sourced nearly 80 percent of their wine selection. Being born in a winemaking family, Guillot has long been connected to winemakers from various countries. At Wine Drop, he shares, the goal is to really push for the wines by family-owned wine companies, especially the ones he personally can vouch for.\n\u201cI like to work with friends and it\u2019s easier for me to sell it to you or to the F&amp;B director and say, this [wine is by] my friend. When I look at all the labels, I know all the winemakers, and I\u2019m very happy to be the messenger for them.\u201d\nIn the store, Wine Drop has also partnered with chefs whose dishes and products make up the shop\u2019s concise menu. \u201cWe\u2019re not a bar or a restaurant,\u201d Guillot emphasizes. What started as a basic platter of cold cuts and cheese to simply accompany the wines being showcased eventually grew. \u201cIt\u2019s not enough. When people come here, they want to taste the wine, [so] they need food. If you drink without eating, you know what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d Guillot laughs.\nFrench masterchef\nCyrille Soenen\nhelped develop the les plats canaille menu for Wine Drop. Les plats canaille, Guillot explains, are French dishes meant to be shared at the table. \u201cYou put it in a big pot, a bit like when you\u2019re with your family and friends, and you put it in the middle and share.\u201d\nCassoulet, a slow-cooked stew popular in France\nCold cuts and cheese. The cheese board features cheese from Malagos farm in Davao\nFrom Soenen\u2019s CiCou are appetizers like chicken liver and pork head p\u00e2t\u00e9, beetroot salmon gravlax, quiche, and a light but delectable fougasse pissaladi\u00e8re. Hot dishes like beef bourguignon, chicken confit, and cassoulet as well as desserts like kouign-amann and chocolate moelleux are also available.\nMeanwhile, Spanish chef Chele Gonzalez stocks Wine Drop with deli favorites like the New York style beef brisket pastrami and grilled octopus a la Gallega. Blackpig supplies the shop with eight-inch pizzas alongside tapas by Txanton. Amid global fare, an assortment of cheese by local farm Malagos can also be enjoyed with cold cuts.\n\u201cThe Philippines is making fantastic cheese. Even as a Frenchman, I\u2019m so happy and proud we\u2019re putting Philippine cheese on our selection,\u201d Guillot says.\nIn crafting the menu, Guillot emphasizes the meals\u2019 shareability and pairing with wine.&nbsp;\nWine pairing is one of Wine Drop\u2019s primary campaigns, both on social media and in their events. On Instagram, a number of videos highlight different wines paired with various dishes and cuisines. Their events and collaborations also emphasize how wine can be paired with a variety of dishes, from pizza to oysters.\nFougasse pissaladi\u00e8re\nMaking wine approachable\n\u201cThe idea of Wine Drop is to make it fun as well. I really want to make wine fun and more accessible in terms of price and in terms of knowledge for everyone,\u201d Guillot says. \u201cIt\u2019s very important that we are able to teach but in a fun way.\u201d&nbsp;\nTrue to this mission, Wine Drop regularly holds Wine 101 sessions, and even wine game nights, where guests can learn trivia about wine all while enjoying glasses themselves.\nAmong the shelves bearing various wines are books and even board games all about winemaking and drinking. An impressive red box, for example, opens up to dozens of vials, each one representing a key ingredient or scent profile you\u2019d likely find in a variety of wines. The board game helps train the nose to pick up the various notes.\nWhile Wine Drop organizes regular wine communes and trivia nights, guests can also enjoy a short, impromptu Wine 101 session at the shop. Everyone\u2019s a wine expert in the shop, Guillot says, so it\u2019s definitely easy to simply ask to know more about the wine you\u2019re drinking.\nWine flights are one way to better understand wines\nAnd when it comes down to it, Guillot recommends really just drinking more to develop one\u2019s taste for wine. \u201cIt\u2019s basic, but drink more wine. When you drink, always look at the label and try to get three main pieces of information: the country, the region, and the grape varietal. And when you drink, put a note on your phone, and if you come [to us] with a list of wines you like and don\u2019t like, we can tell you what you should get.\u201d\n\u201cAnd come to Wine Drop, go for dinner with six friends. Let\u2019s do a Wine 101. For 30 minutes, you learn, and after, you have a great evening here. So at least, you get drunk, but you get smarter.\u201d\nRead more",

Inquirer file and stock photos\nKUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia \u2014 Malaysia\u2019s Foreign Ministry called Wednesday for a police investigation into a leaked diplomatic note from China over the South China Sea dispute.\nThe ministry said details of a Feb. 18 diplomatic note from China\u2019s Foreign Ministry to the Malaysian Embassy in Beijing was published by a Filipino media outlet on Aug. 29. It didn\u2019t give details but alluded to the South China Sea row in its statement.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nINQUIRER.net had published a diplomatic note in which Beijing reportedly demanded that Malaysia immediately halt all activities in an oil-rich maritime area off Sarawak state on Borneo island.\nFEATURED STORIES\nWWW\nLIVE UPDATES: Bar exam results 2024\nWWW\nTeodoro says petitions to cancel candidacy \u2018political maneuvering\u2019\nWWW\nLabor group seeks suspension of ballot printing for 2025 polls\nREAD:\nMalaysia gets taste of China West Philippine Sea bullying\nThe report said China had accused Malaysia of encroaching on areas covered by its 10-dash line, Beijing\u2019s controversial map showing its claims to sovereignty in the South China Sea.

Unlike the Philippines which has had public clashes with China in the disputed area, Malaysia\u2019s government prefers diplomatic channels. It rarely criticizes Beijing publicly, even though Chinese coast guard ships have sailed near Malaysia\u2019s waters. This is partly to protect economic ties as China has been Malaysia\u2019s top trading partner since 2009.\nThe ministry said Malaysia and China were committed to peaceful settlements, without any recourse to disputes and violence.

        "content": "Rodrigo Duterte \u2014BING GONZALES\nMANILA, Philippines \u2014 Former President Rodrigo Duterte appears to be at the \u201ccenter\u201d of a \u201cgrand criminal enterprise\u201d to wage a brutal war on drugs to enable and to profit from the very same scourge he had openly and strongly campaigned to eliminate, according to a preliminary report on a monthslong House inquiry.\nAs it turned out, Duterte was \u201cthe face of illegal drugs and criminality\u201d in the country, Antipolo Rep. Romeo Acop said late Thursday, reading a report on the findings of the House quad committee on the links between Philippine offshore gaming operators (Pogos), illegal drugs and extrajudicial killings (EJKs) during the previous administration.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\n\u201cLadies and gentlemen, the quad comm has started to uncover a grand criminal enterprise, and it would seem that at the center of it is former President Duterte,\u201d Acop said. \u201cNapakasakit po nito dahil pawang tayo ay nabudol. (This is so painful because we were all scammed).\u201d\nFEATURED STORIES\nNEWSINFO\nBar exam 2024: List of successful examinees\nNEWSINFO\n3 schools have highest percentage of passers among first-time bar exam takers\nNEWSINFO\nHouse panel: Ex-president Duterte center of grand criminal enterprise\nAcierto revelations\nHe said that a former \u201cright-hand man\u201d of Duterte who had testified during one quad committee hearing, dismissed narcotics officer Eduardo Acierto, described the former chief executive as the \u201clord of all drug lords.\u201d\n\u201cNapakasakit po dahil (It\u2019s very painful because) Mr. Duterte won on a platform of a hardline stance against illegal drugs and criminality. Siya pala ang mukha ng illegal drugs at kriminalidad. (It turned out that he was after all the face of illegal drugs and criminality),\u201d said Acop, a retired police general who was chief of the Criminal Investigation and Detection Group.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nHe said the quad committee\u2019s job was difficult and that no one wanted to go up against a popular former president. But like Duterte, lawmakers were elected by the people and have a responsibility to them, he said.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\n\u201cKaya ipagpapatuloy po natin ang ating inquiry at sisguraduhin po naming aayusin ang ating mga batas upang masiguro na hindi na mauulit ang mga kaganapang ating natuklasan. (That\u2019s why we will continue our inquiry and make sure to fix our laws so that none of these things that we have discovered would be repeated),\u201d Acop said.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nSummary of findings\nHe laid down a summary of the quad committee\u2019s findings from its inquiry which opened in August with testimonies and documents presented by dozens of \u201cresource persons,\u201d including retired and active duty police officers, relatives and supporters of drug war victims, local and national officials, and Duterte himself.\nAcop reported that Duterte and his inner circle used the drug war as a cover for the so-called \u201cDavao Mafia\u201d to profit off the drug trade and eliminate its competition.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nDuterte, who appeared before the panel on Nov. 13, had denied these allegations but admitted that he did encourage police officers to carry out his drug war by all means necessary to eradicate the scourge.\nThe former president also said he assumed responsibility for everything that happened under his campaign. The police\u2019s official report said over 6,000 people were killed during Duterte\u2019s presidency, but human rights groups believed the number could reach as high as 30,000.\nOther testimonies\nIn addition to Acierto, Acop cited the testimonies of former Bureau of Customs (BOC) intelligence officer Jimmy Guban, ex-BOC broker Mark Taguba, former Senators Leila de Lima and Antonio Trillanes IV, and former Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office general manager and retired police officer Royina Garma. They all identified either Duterte or people close to him as having links to the drug trade or to the human rights violations that came with his drug war.\n\u201cEach of these individuals carried with them intimate knowledge of the inner workings of the drug trade in the Philippines\u2014and what do they have in common? They spoke out and revealed what was really happening in the drug war, and because of this, they all suffered and earned the ire of the president,\u201d Acop said.\nYang connection\nDuterte\u2019s close associates included his former economic adviser, Chinese businessman Michael Yang, whom Acierto and Guban alleged was a drug lord himself and who supposedly owned a meth lab in Dumoy, Davao City, which was raided by the authorities in 2004.\nThough this case is now 20 years old, the Dumoy raid came under renewed scrutiny after Duterte admitted in a recent interview that he \u201celiminated everybody who was involved,\u201d including six Chinese nationals.\nYang allegedly has links to illegal Pogos with his business partner Allan Lim (also known as Lin Weixiong) and his brother Antonio Yang.\nAcierto, Taguba and Guban also linked Yang, Duterte\u2019s son, Davao Rep. Paolo Duterte, and his son-in-law Manases Carpio, to two major drug smuggling cases in 2017 and 2018, which involved P6.4 billion and P3.4 billion worth of crystal methamphetamine (\u201cshabu\u201d), respectively. They said the drugs were smuggled through the Manila International Container Terminal.\n\u2018Tara\u2019 system\nThese shipments supposedly bypassed inspections through the \u201ctara\u201d system\u2014a deeply entrenched bribery scheme within the BOC where millions of pesos in grease money facilitated the unimpeded entry of drugs.\nAcierto was the first to blow the whistle on Yang and reported this to Duterte, Sen. Christopher \u201cBong\u201d Go, and Sen. Ronald \u201cBato\u201d dela Rosa, but he was ignored, the former police colonel said.\nAcierto fled the country after supposedly learning of a plot to assassinate him. He is one of the witnesses in the case against Duterte in the International Criminal Court.\nOne of the most explosive testimonies during the hearings came from Garma, who alleged that there was a rewards system that incentivized the killing of drug offenders by police officers and that this was patterned after the scheme implemented by Duterte in Davao City where he was mayor for over two decades.\nConfirmation\nFormer Albuera, Leyte, police chief Col. Jovie Espenido confirmed the existence of the rewards system in which police officers received up to P100,000 for each alleged drug offender killed. He said the reward was managed by Go, a former special assistant to the President, who allegedly used money from confidential funds and profits from Small Town Lottery. Go has strongly denied this.\n\u201cThe existence of the rewards system is not denied,\u201d Acop said. \u201cIn fact, pinagmayabang pa ito ni former President Duterte at ang kanyang mga alipores (former President Duterte and his cohorts even bragged about it).\u201d\nThis reward system led to countless EJKs and \u201cso many of them were collateral damage,\u201d Acop said.\nDuterte made many incriminating statements at the quad committee hearing, including admitting that he had killed \u201csix or seven\u201d \u201ccriminals\u201d when he was mayor.\nHe also recalled that he often patrolled the streets of Davao on his motorbike in hopes of catching criminals and killing them himself.\nBato: No surprise\nDela Rosa said he was not surprised by Acop\u2019s conclusions.\nThe senator, Duterte\u2019s first Philippine National Police chief and the first implementer of the drug war, insisted that the House quad committee\u2019s mission was to \u201cdestroy the Dutertes.\u201d\n\u201cWe launched the war on drugs not to enrich ourselves, but to save this republic from becoming a narco state and save the Filipinos, especially the youth, from the evils of illegal drugs,\u201d Dela Rosa told the Inquirer.\n\u201cWe did not deceive the people. I swear before the graves of my policemen who offered the ultimate sacrifice in the war on drugs,\u201d he said.\nPNP data\nPNP data from July 2016 to June 2022 showed that 312 officers were killed and 974 were injured in Duterte\u2019s drug war.\nThe initial findings of the megapanel composed of the committees on human rights, dangerous drugs, public order and safety, and public accounts, will be presented to the plenary on Dec. 17.\nYour subscription could not be saved.

Meanwhile, they will be working on the legislative measures they filed as part of the quad committee\u2019s output, including a bill that would specifically penalize EJKs, Barbers said.\n\u2014WITH REPORTS FROM MARLON RAMOS, PNA, AND INQUIRER RESEARCH\nREAD NEXT\nPagasa: Cloudy weather, rain still likely in parts of PH\nEnforce discount laws,&nbsp;commuters tell LTFRB\nEDITORS' PICK\nClimate change intensified back-to-back PH storms \u2013 study\nNegros Occidental declares state of calamity after Kanlaon blast\nMore foreign brands seen coming to PH shores in 2025\nSOCIAL CLIMATE: Life has shortened\nNBA: Embiid hit in face, misses 2nd half of 76ers' loss to Pacers\nBuilding a league of their own with the WMPBL\nMOST READ\nComelec exempts 48 projects from election ban\nLorraine Badoy after red-tagging civil suit loss: \u2018Fight isn\u2019t over\u2019\nBar exam 2024: List of successful examinees\n3 schools have highest percentage of passers among first-time bar exam takers\nFollow\n@FMangosingINQ\non Twitter\n-->\nView comments",

(AP Photo/Kirsty Wigglesworth, File)\nLONDON \u2014 A suspected Chinese spy with business ties to Prince Andrew has been barred from the U.K. because of concerns he poses a threat to national security.\nA British immigration tribunal upheld the decision on Thursday in a ruling that revealed the Chinese national had developed such a close relationship with Andrew that he was invited to the prince\u2019s birthday party. Government officials were concerned the man could have misused his influence because the prince was under \u201cconsiderable pressure\u201d at the time, according to the ruling.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nBritish authorities believe the Chinese national, whose name wasn\u2019t released, was working on behalf of the United Front Work Department, an arm of the Chinese Communist Party that is used to influence foreign entities.\nFEATURED STORIES\nBUSINESS\nMore foreign brands seen coming to PH shores in 2025\nBUSINESS\nGlobal Dominion: Simplifying financing to empower every Filipino\nBUSINESS\nInternational group kicks off infrastructure investment drive for PH\nREAD:\nAnger in UK over Prince Andrew\u2019s \u2018\u00a312 million\u2019 settlement\nThe government determined that the businessman \u201cwas in a position to generate relationships between senior Chinese officials and prominent U.K. figures which could be leveraged for political interference purposes by the Chinese State,\u201d according to the tribunal\u2019s decision.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nPrince Andrew, the younger brother of King Charles III, has been repeatedly criticized for his links to wealthy foreigners, raising concerns that those individuals are trying to buy access to the royal family.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nAndrew\u2019s finances have been squeezed in recent years after he was forced to step away from royal duties and give up public funding amid concerns about his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein, the American financier and convicted pedophile who committed suicide in prison in 2019.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nBritish intelligence chiefs have become increasingly concerned about China\u2019s efforts to influence U.K. government policy. In 2022, Britain\u2019s domestic intelligence service, known as MI5, warned politicians that a British-Chinese lawyer had been seeking to improperly influence members of Parliament for years. A parliamentary researcher was arrested in 2023 on suspicion of providing sensitive information to China.\nThe 50-year-old Chinese national covered by this week\u2019s ruling was described as a man who worked as a junior civil servant in China before he came to the U.K. as a student in 2002. He earned a master\u2019s degree in public administration and public policy at the University of York before starting a business that advises U.K.-based companies on their operations in China.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nHe was granted the right to live and work in the U.K. for an indefinite period in 2013. Although he didn\u2019t make Britain his permanent home, the man told authorities that he spent one to two weeks a month in the country and considered it his \u201csecond home.\u201d\nHe was stopped while entering the U.K. on Nov. 6, 2021, and ordered to surrender his mobile phone and other digital devices on which authorities found a letter from a senior adviser to Andrew confirming that he was authorized to act on behalf of the prince in relation to potential partners and investors in China.\nThe letter and other documents highlighted the strength of the relationship between Andrew, his adviser and the Chinese national.\n\u201cI also hope that it is clear to you where you sit with my principal and indeed his family,\u201d the adviser wrote. \u201cYou should never underestimate the strength of that relationship. Outside of his closest internal confidants, you sit at the very top of a tree that many, many people would like to be on.\u201d\nThe letter went on to describe how they had found a way to work around former private secretaries to the prince and other people who weren\u2019t completely trusted.\n\u201cUnder your guidance, we found a way to get the relevant people unnoticed in and out of the house in Windsor,\u201d the adviser wrote.\nYour subscription could not be saved.

rates \u201cat the right time\u201d.\nThe annual Central Economic Work Conference was being closely watched for signs of more stimulus, though the announcement \u2014 which included stabilizing foreign trade and supporting the troubled property sector \u2014 was unable to boost sentiment.\nThe gathering came after Beijing began unveiling in September a raft of policies to reverse a growth slump that has gripped the economy for almost two years.\nJulian Evans-Pritchard of Capital Economics said it remained unclear how big a boost there would be, adding that, \u201cwhile we may get a near-term stimulus bounce, we\u2019re still not convinced that policy support will prevent the economy from slowing further next year\u201d.\nAnd strategists at Bank of America Global Research said:

at Saxo Markets.\n\u201cRecent (consumer price index) reports show that inflation is still sticky, and if Trump\u2019s policies \u2014 like higher fiscal spending or tariffs \u2014 are enacted,

REYES\nThe President\u2019s decision to ban Philippine offshore gaming operators (Pogos) has presented new challenges for the government, particularly the legal gaps related to managing assets such as buildings and lands confiscated from alleged criminal operations linked to these hubs.\nOver the past months, lawmakers and officials have proposed various uses for the idle properties, including converting them into evacuation centers, schools, or government offices.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nHowever, Justice Undersecretary Nicholas Ty, head of the Inter-Agency Council Against Trafficking (Iacat) established by law in 2012, highlighted one of the many concerns they faced: the need for immediate access to the resources seized from suspected scam hubs to support trafficking victims and Pogo employees rescued during raids.\nFEATURED STORIES\nGLOBALNATION\nPH asserts rights over Bajo de Masinloc at UN General Assembly\nGLOBALNATION\nPCG: China using AIS spoofing to mislead public and stir confusion\nGLOBALNATION\n'Aid for Kristine-hit Batangas': Presidential assistance for farmers, fisherfolk, families\n\u201c[There is] an absence of a clear provision that expressly empowers [the] state [to] provisionally use assets pending forfeiture, especially money that can be used to maintain victims and facilities,\u201d Ty told the Inquirer on Thursday.\nREAD:\nAuthorities raid Pogo hub in Bataan BPO company\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nAlthough the Anti-Financial Account Scamming Act signed in July 2024 addresses this matter, Ty noted that Iacat was still waiting for its implementing rules and regulations.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nIn the meantime, the government found a \u201ccreative solution\u201d\u2014\u201ccommandeering\u201d raided facilities and using them to house thousands of trafficking victims, he said.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nAccording to Iacat\u2019s records, over 3,000 Pogo employees have been rescued and \u201cpresumed to be victims of human trafficking.\u201d\n\u201cWe do not really have enough shelters to house these victims of trafficking, and if we do let them out, chances are they are just gonna be re-trafficked or revictimized in another scam hub,\u201d Ty said during a forum last Tuesday organized by the Stratbase ADR Institute.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nA comprehensive inventory of the total number of buildings, floor area, land area, and estimated value has not been published by the authorities following the raids on these hubs, notably those in Bamban, Tarlac, and Porac, Pampanga.\nThere has also been no disclosure of any plan by responsible government agencies to inspect these properties to determine whether they were suitable for classrooms, offices, medical facilities, evacuation centers, or other purposes while criminal and civil forfeiture cases are pending.\nNew Marcos warning\nLess than three weeks before his year-end deadline to shut down all Pogos in the country, which he announced in his State of the Nation Address in July, President Marcos warned that those who run \u201cguerrilla\u201d or rogue Pogo and internet gaming licensees (IGLs) after he had canceled all their licenses.\nMr. Marcos formalized the ban in November under Executive Order No. 74.\n\u201cWe will never let them wreak havoc on us again. Anyone who attempts to launch illegal operations will face the full force of our laws,\u201d the President said.\nHe posted his remarks on Facebook and Instagram on Wednesday night, after meeting with Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corp. (Pagcor) chair Alejandro Tengco, Presidential Anti-Organized Crime Commission (PAOCC) chief Gilbert Cruz, Interior Secretary Juan Victor \u201cJonvic\u201d Remulla and other government officials on winding down the operations of the remaining offshore gaming hubs.\nOn Thursday morning, the President ordered law enforcement agencies to carry out small but multiple operations against offshore gaming operators that were still running their businesses despite the ban.\nHe directed local officials to coordinate with the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) in going after Pogos and IGLs in their areas and ordered the DILG to step up gathering intelligence on the presence of Pogos in communities.\nCanceled licenses\nAccording to Malaca\u00f1ang, 53,700 Pogo licenses were canceled, while 18 IGLs voluntarily canceled theirs as of Nov. 29. By Dec. 31, all licenses will be deemed canceled, and the Philippines will supposedly be \u201cPogo-free\u201d by January 2025.\nIt said 353,000 visas had been issued to foreign workers for these gaming establishments. By the end of the Duterte administration, only 33,863 remained, and 23,099 of them recently left the country.\nMany more foreigners, mostly Chinese, entered the country as tourists and found jobs as Pogo workers, according to a Senate investigation of the pastillas scam. The total number of foreign workers working legally and illegally in Pogos could far exceed the number of legitimate employment visas issued by the government.\nDuring Tuesday\u2019s forum, Ty said that since Pogo hubs were usually one-stop shops, not just the offices but actual residences of the trafficking victims, the government used the facilities to temporarily house rescued workers there.\nHe said that under the Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act, \u201cproceeds of instruments of human trafficking can be forfeited in favor of Iacat for the benefit of victims of human trafficking.\u201d\nNo typical victim\nAnother significant legal challenge is \u201cvictim identification\u201d and \u201cforced criminality\u201d because many rescued individuals refuse to see themselves as trafficking victims, Ty said.\nHe said that human trafficking, often described as modern-day slavery, differs from past enslavement where victims were treated as property.\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s why it becomes even more complex in the victimology of the trafficking victims and the scam hubs. Because they are not, at least from the Philippine perspective, the typical trafficking victim who is from a very poor location who is mired in poverty, who is not that educated,\u201d he explained.\n\u201cThe victims of human trafficking, at least from the Philippines\u2014well, even from other countries\u2014they\u2019re usually college graduates from middle-income families. They\u2019re tech-savvy,\u201d Ty added.\nHe said the authorities will use other measures, such as anticorruption laws, to prosecute \u201cother enablers\u201d of human trafficking like government officials.\n\u2018Leakage\u2019 probe\nFor its part, the Supreme Court said it found no evidence linking members of the judiciary to the alleged \u201cleakage\u201d of information regarding the Porac raid last June.\nChief Justice Alexander Gesmundo on Wednesday told reporters that preliminary inquiries \u201cdid not get positive results\u201d and that judges and court staff were involved.\nWhen authorities raided the Pogo compound in Porac, the PAOCC found only 158 Chinese, Vietnamese, and Malaysians instead of the more than 1,000 individuals who were supposedly there at the time\u2014an indication that the operators had insider information about the raid.\nSen. Sherwin Gatchalian later alleged the result of the raid showed the possible influence of Chinese syndicates in the judiciary and that when PAOCC requested a search warrant, the Pogo operators received a tip.\nYour subscription could not be saved.

Lacson street, named after the feisty mayor of Manila who served from 1952-1962, that connects Sampaloc to Nagtahan and Pandacan.\nPeople born in the last century, like me, remember it as \u201cPor-Bes,\u201d named after William Cameron Forbes who served as the United States governor general from 1909-1913. But Forbes has not been completely erased from the landscape because of Forbes Park in Makati. While Forbes Park remains the premiere gated community in the country, its reputation is far from aspirational in some sectors. Taipan Lucio Tan used to refer to it, in jest, as \u201cPobres Park,\u201d referring to the number of mortgaged, hard-to-sell properties, in the enclave.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nForbes came to mind recently when I went on a tour of \u201cMansion House,\u201d the official summer residence of American governors general and later Philippine presidents. Many years ago, I thought aloud, \u201cIsn\u2019t Mansion House redundant? Aba! Mansion na, House pa?\u201d I was glad when the giant Instagrammable sign on its lawn declared, \u201cThe Mansion.\u201d\nFEATURED STORIES\nOPINION\nUrgent action needed vs online piracy as Congress session nears end\nOPINION\nLife has shortened\nOPINION\nThe gift of second chances\nWhile grammatically correct and tighter to an editor\u2019s eye, I found that Forbes had a vacation home in the US called \u201cMansion House.\u201d From a 1907 publication, I learned that Mansion House was built on the highest site in Baguio, and that Governor Forbes\u2019 summer residence was called \u201cTopside.\u201d\nI had never been inside Mansion House and always saw it from outside its elegant wrought iron gate. It is open to the public now, thanks to the initiative of First Lady Liza A. Marcos, as a museum of Philippine presidents and the presidency. You can register for a tour slot online, but none were available and we were only in Baguio for two nights, so we tried our luck as \u201cwalk-in\u201d patrons. Being seniors must have helped because everywhere we went, the young staff were courteous and attentive.

We were reminded that photography is prohibited in the exhibit halls, a policy that has to be relaxed because there is so much historical data on the walls. Interested patrons should be allowed to take pictures not just of the wall texts, but the few presidential memorabilia on display.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThe first room was an introduction to Mansion House and Baguio. Archival photographs brought visitors back to the time when it was a colonial hill station. One must remember that in an age without air-conditioning, the heavyweight first civil governor William Howard Taft suffered in Manila\u2019s heat. Baguio as a \u201csummer capital\u201d was just that: in the hot months, the whole government transferred and operated there. This explains why we have Cabinet Hill with cottages for all department secretaries. Teachers Camp was for training, meetings, as well as rest and recreation. Today, only the Supreme Court comes up for summer sessions.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nFrom the first room, one proceeds along a narrow hall lined with portraits of all the First Ladies of the Philippines, from Hilaria Aguinaldo to Liza Marcos. While students are introduced to the sequence of Philippine presidents in Araling Panlipunan, first ladies are only remembered by the bright ones who compete in quiz bees. The list goes: Hilaria Aguinaldo, Aurora Quezon, Paciencia Laurel, Esperanza Osme\u00f1a, Trinidad Roxas, Victoria Quirino (not a spouse but a daughter because Elpidio Quirino was a widower), Luz Magsaysay, Leonila Garcia, Eva Macapagal, Imelda Marcos, Amelita Ramos, Loi Ejercito, Jose Miguel Arroyo (the only thorn among the proverbial roses because the President was a woman), and Liza Marcos. There were three vacancies: Corazon Aquino was a widow and her son Benigno S. Aquino III was a bachelor so they both went solo and did not designate a person to fill the role. With Rodrigo Duterte, it was complicated, no one was designated.\nThe rest of the galleries cover each president from Aguinaldo to Marcos Jr. Wall texts provide: biographical details, term of office, significant achievements, a portrait, quotable quote, and a facsimile signature. In vitrines are photographs and memorabilia. Our tour guide showed public history in practice, making each president human in her spiel. My only problem was that in the timeline for Ferdinand E. Marcos Sr., there was no reference to the 1986 people power that led to his \u201cexile.\u201d Since Feb. 25 and Aug. 21 remain holidays under the second Marcos administration, curators should have taken the cue and simply stated fact instead of inviting criticism through a glaring omission.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013\nComments are welcome at aocampo@ateneo.edu\nYour subscription could not be saved.

        "content": "Indonesia\u2014Since their invention in the early 20th century, plastics have been omnipresent in our daily life, and have become a global choice due to their durability, flexibility, and low production cost. Industries ranging from food to electronics have been relying for decades on plastics, their primary material for product packaging. Plastic serves as protection, marketing and information tool, and a convenient way to transport products. For optimal performance, plastic is often combined with other materials, making it difficult to recycle.\nDespite the ample benefits, plastic\u2019s versatility may pose risks to health and the environment. Since the 1950s, plastic consumption has surged, reaching 400.3 million tons in global production in 2022 alone, much of them for single-use packaging to preserve food and protect fragile items.\nBut environmental alarms are sounding. Researcher Hannah Ritchie and colleagues estimate that 0.5 percent of plastics end up in the ocean, harming marine ecosystems. Traces of plastic also pollute mountains, forests, and waterways.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nTo deal with the problem, businesses and governments have been showing a stronger commitment. The fifth Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee (INC-5) on Plastic Pollution from Nov. 25 to Dec. 1 in Busan, South Korea, was meant to draft an international legally binding instrument to tackle the plastic pollution problem.\nFEATURED STORIES\nOPINION\nUrgent action needed vs online piracy as Congress session nears end\nOPINION\nLife has shortened\nOPINION\nThe gift of second chances\nThe momentum is building as over 260 businesses, from multinationals to local enterprises, have joined the Business Coalition for a Global Plastics Treaty (BCGPT), urging governments at INC-5 to adopt an ambitious, full-lifecycle plastics treaty. This collective effort also aims to foster awareness, innovation, and a sustainable ecosystem with the prospect of global regulations under a treaty.\nIndustry has also been exploring solutions like optimizing and harmonizing packaging (Reduce), reusable packaging, and design for recycling. It has also been increasing recycled content along with developing bioplastics and paper-based options to reduce virgin plastic use. These innovations require comprehensive life cycle assessments and suitable waste management for bio-based plastics to ensure sustainable impact.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nAs well, food and beverage packaging must meet strict safety and compliance standards to protect consumers. Key guidelines include Food and Drug Monitoring Agency Regulation No. 20/2019, and international standards like those from the United States Food and Drug Administration, the European Medicines Agency, and the European Food Safety Authority, detailing permitted, limited, and banned substances. Additionally, packaging should be environmentally safe, functional, competitively priced, and of high quality.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nLeading producers of fast-moving consumer goods have also optimized packaging size, increased recycled content and used easier-to-recycle materials. They\u2019ve introduced reusable designs and innovations as well, like paper straws.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nBut are these alternatives enough to address the plastic crisis?\nRecycling is important, but not enough. In fact, less than 10 percent of plastic waste is currently recycled globally. The remaining waste often ends up being incinerated in landfills.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThen there\u2019s the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) program, which requires companies to manage their products\u2019 end-of-life, which is now gaining traction, especially in developed countries with advanced waste management. However, for EPR to be effective globally, stronger waste management systems are essential, particularly in developing countries where they remain inadequate and poorly managed, leading to high rates of plastic leakage into rivers and oceans.\nI\u2019d strongly suggest maximizing our efforts for waste collection, waste segregation, and building the infrastructure to process related waste. We must ensure greater quantity and better quality feedstock for secondary raw materials to increase the recycling rate and recycled content. For packaging, we can work on nonfood contact material if the food contact material is not yet available.\nWe also need stricter but more conducive regulations to prevent plastic leakage and to promote and encourage the use of sustainable materials, given the higher costs incurred when industry switches to easy-to-recycle materials or to recycled-content materials. Waste management systems should not create new problems, such as improper disposal of hazardous byproducts.\nThe plastic crisis requires multiple solutions. Global rules can unify multi-stakeholder efforts to phase out problematic plastics, but consumer behavior change is also essential. Now is the time to advocate for stronger regulations, better waste management, and a collective shift in consumption and production. Plastics were considered a \u201cmiracle\u201d when they were first introduced for packaging. They now pose challenges and are perceived as a symbol of unsustainability.\nIt is time to rethink our relationship with plastics for the sake of the planet.

        "content": "Make America Great Again! (MAGA)\u201d\nSo goes the campaign slogan of reelected United States President Donald Trump. Interestingly, it isn\u2019t all that original since a similar one was used back in 1965 by then Sen. Ferdinand E. Marcos Sr. during his successful march to his first term as Philippine president.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nWith Trump\u2019s imminent assumption of office, the air is rife with speculations on how he would actually translate his campaign slogan into reality via specific programs, legislative proposals, and foreign policy. From the thrust of statements he\u2019s been making, it seems he intends to effect major structural policy and even sociopolitical changes on both the domestic and foreign affairs fronts. I will leave it to others to discuss sociopolitical matters, as those are more peculiar to American societal interaction that many others are more familiar with.\nFEATURED STORIES\nOPINION\nUrgent action needed vs online piracy as Congress session nears end\nOPINION\nLife has shortened\nOPINION\nThe gift of second chances\nSuffice it for me to observe, at the risk of being simplistic, that he appears determined to restore \u201ctraditional values,\u201d and put the brakes on the forward march of progressive liberalism particularly its so called \u201cwoke\u201d fringe. Somewhat associated with these are two of his highest priorities: securing US borders from the recent surge of illegal migrants, and rebalancing (as he sees it) the country\u2019s energy sector development strategy from a rapid headlong plunge into renewable energy dependence, toward a somewhat more gradual transition to that goal by restoring fossil fuel exploration, or as he puts it, \u201cDrill baby, drill.\u201d\nOn the domestic economic front, his game plan appears aimed at restoring dynamic economic growth by tax cuts and reduced government regulation. This, he hopes, would energize the private sector and put more disposable income in the pockets of the middle and working class, entrepreneurs, and corporations, thus creating jobs and hopefully, a virtuous cycle of higher employment rates that would broaden the tax base and generate a more positive budget outcome to meet the pressing financing needs of, among others, modernizing the country\u2019s infrastructure.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThe downside to this strategy is that the effect of tax cuts has a lag time during which already serious fiscal deficits may grow, resulting in even greater temptation to print money that will end up fueling inflation and escalating the level of national debt that even now threatens to become unmanageable. This latter vicious cycle outcome Trump hopes to stem by serious cuts in expenditure.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nSuch cuts appear to depend mainly on a draconian review of \u201cwasteful government expenditures\u201d by the envisioned new Department of Government Efficiency led by Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy. This involves the surgical trimming of perceived bloated bureaucracy in such agencies as the departments of education and of defense, and defense expenditure itself. The US defense budget is 10 times that of the next 10 countries in the world combined as it maintains 750 military bases in 80 countries. Furthermore, an announced centerpiece of Trump\u2019s foreign policy is to proactively encourage negotiations toward peace on all major war fronts, if only to carry the record of having no wars during his tenure.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nHowever, the bellicose side of his foreign policy, namely tariff drumbeating designed, it seems, to restore a more vibrant manufacturing sector to the US economy, could be problematic. He may find that his tendency toward breast beating may have to be balanced by his equally adept sense of the \u201cart of the deal\u201d toward win-win solutions in a world where BRICS\u2014a forum for cooperation among a group of emerging economies including Brazil, Russia, China and the United Arab Emirates\u2014is a serious reality rather than a pushover. As well, the evolution from a unipolar to a multipolar world order appears to be gaining momentum so that moves to preserve US trade and military dominance may have to be tempered with a wiser strategy of revitalizing US competitiveness toward winning the hearts and minds of the world\u2019s citizenry.\nAssuming things go reasonably well toward the MAGA scenario, what\u2019s in it for the Philippines? At the very least, a US economy averting pneumonia will help stabilize the value of the peso and continue the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas\u2019 already optimistic scenario of progressively lowering interest rates. There are also signs that the US is more interested in an investment-oriented, rather than a China-containment, policy with us, such that Musk is reportedly eyeing the Philippines as a significant center for his expanded Asian business operations. Under these circumstances, President Marcos would be well advised to lead in calming turbulent local political waters, refocusing on the country\u2019s economic priorities and comparative advantages, and dusting off his father\u2019s battle cry, \u201cThis nation can be great again.\u201d\nArticle continues after this advertisement\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\nRoberto F.

        "content": "FILE PHOTO: A Philippine offshore gaming operator (Pogo) hub operating behind the town hall of Bamban in Tarlac province has been shut down following a government raid in March 2024 due to human trafficking, online scams, and other illegal activities. INQUIRER/RICHARD A. REYES\nThe President\u2019s decision to ban Philippine offshore gaming operators (Pogos) has presented new challenges for the government, particularly the legal gaps related to managing assets such as buildings and lands confiscated from alleged criminal operations linked to these hubs.\nOver the past months, lawmakers and officials have proposed various uses for the idle properties, including converting them into evacuation centers, schools, or government offices.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nHowever, Justice Undersecretary Nicholas Ty, head of the Inter-Agency Council Against Trafficking (Iacat) established by law in 2012, highlighted one of the many concerns they faced: the need for immediate access to the resources seized from suspected scam hubs to support trafficking victims and Pogo employees rescued during raids.\nFEATURED STORIES\nGLOBALNATION\nPH asserts rights over Bajo de Masinloc at UN General Assembly\nGLOBALNATION\nPCG: China using AIS spoofing to mislead public and stir confusion\nGLOBALNATION\n'Aid for Kristine-hit Batangas': Presidential assistance for farmers, fisherfolk, families\n\u201c[There is] an absence of a clear provision that expressly empowers [the] state [to] provisionally use assets pending forfeiture, especially money that can be used to maintain victims and facilities,\u201d Ty told the Inquirer on Thursday.\nREAD:\nAuthorities raid Pogo hub in Bataan BPO company\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nAlthough the Anti-Financial Account Scamming Act signed in July 2024 addresses this matter, Ty noted that Iacat was still waiting for its implementing rules and regulations.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nIn the meantime, the government found a \u201ccreative solution\u201d\u2014\u201ccommandeering\u201d raided facilities and using them to house thousands of trafficking victims, he said.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nAccording to Iacat\u2019s records, over 3,000 Pogo employees have been rescued and \u201cpresumed to be victims of human trafficking.\u201d\n\u201cWe do not really have enough shelters to house these victims of trafficking, and if we do let them out, chances are they are just gonna be re-trafficked or revictimized in another scam hub,\u201d Ty said during a forum last Tuesday organized by the Stratbase ADR Institute.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nA comprehensive inventory of the total number of buildings, floor area, land area, and estimated value has not been published by the authorities following the raids on these hubs, notably those in Bamban, Tarlac, and Porac, Pampanga.\nThere has also been no disclosure of any plan by responsible government agencies to inspect these properties to determine whether they were suitable for classrooms, offices, medical facilities, evacuation centers, or other purposes while criminal and civil forfeiture cases are pending.\nNew Marcos warning\nLess than three weeks before his year-end deadline to shut down all Pogos in the country, which he announced in his State of the Nation Address in July, President Marcos warned that those who run \u201cguerrilla\u201d or rogue Pogo and internet gaming licensees (IGLs) after he had canceled all their licenses.\nMr. Marcos formalized the ban in November under Executive Order No. 74.\n\u201cWe will never let them wreak havoc on us again. Anyone who attempts to launch illegal operations will face the full force of our laws,\u201d the President said.\nHe posted his remarks on Facebook and Instagram on Wednesday night, after meeting with Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corp. (Pagcor) chair Alejandro Tengco, Presidential Anti-Organized Crime Commission (PAOCC) chief Gilbert Cruz, Interior Secretary Juan Victor \u201cJonvic\u201d Remulla and other government officials on winding down the operations of the remaining offshore gaming hubs.\nOn Thursday morning, the President ordered law enforcement agencies to carry out small but multiple operations against offshore gaming operators that were still running their businesses despite the ban.\nHe directed local officials to coordinate with the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) in going after Pogos and IGLs in their areas and ordered the DILG to step up gathering intelligence on the presence of Pogos in communities.\nCanceled licenses\nAccording to Malaca\u00f1ang, 53,700 Pogo licenses were canceled, while 18 IGLs voluntarily canceled theirs as of Nov. 29. By Dec. 31, all licenses will be deemed canceled, and the Philippines will supposedly be \u201cPogo-free\u201d by January 2025.\nIt said 353,000 visas had been issued to foreign workers for these gaming establishments. By the end of the Duterte administration, only 33,863 remained, and 23,099 of them recently left the country.\nMany more foreigners, mostly Chinese, entered the country as tourists and found jobs as Pogo workers, according to a Senate investigation of the pastillas scam. The total number of foreign workers working legally and illegally in Pogos could far exceed the number of legitimate employment visas issued by the government.\nDuring Tuesday\u2019s forum, Ty said that since Pogo hubs were usually one-stop shops, not just the offices but actual residences of the trafficking victims, the government used the facilities to temporarily house rescued workers there.\nHe said that under the Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act, \u201cproceeds of instruments of human trafficking can be forfeited in favor of Iacat for the benefit of victims of human trafficking.\u201d\nNo typical victim\nAnother significant legal challenge is \u201cvictim identification\u201d and \u201cforced criminality\u201d because many rescued individuals refuse to see themselves as trafficking victims, Ty said.\nHe said that human trafficking, often described as modern-day slavery, differs from past enslavement where victims were treated as property.\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s why it becomes even more complex in the victimology of the trafficking victims and the scam hubs. Because they are not, at least from the Philippine perspective, the typical trafficking victim who is from a very poor location who is mired in poverty, who is not that educated,\u201d he explained.\n\u201cThe victims of human trafficking, at least from the Philippines\u2014well, even from other countries\u2014they\u2019re usually college graduates from middle-income families. They\u2019re tech-savvy,\u201d Ty added.\nHe said the authorities will use other measures, such as anticorruption laws, to prosecute \u201cother enablers\u201d of human trafficking like government officials.\n\u2018Leakage\u2019 probe\nFor its part, the Supreme Court said it found no evidence linking members of the judiciary to the alleged \u201cleakage\u201d of information regarding the Porac raid last June.\nChief Justice Alexander Gesmundo on Wednesday told reporters that preliminary inquiries \u201cdid not get positive results\u201d and that judges and court staff were involved.\nWhen authorities raided the Pogo compound in Porac, the PAOCC found only 158 Chinese, Vietnamese, and Malaysians instead of the more than 1,000 individuals who were supposedly there at the time\u2014an indication that the operators had insider information about the raid.\nSen. Sherwin Gatchalian later alleged the result of the raid showed the possible influence of Chinese syndicates in the judiciary and that when PAOCC requested a search warrant, the Pogo operators received a tip.\nYour subscription could not be saved.

But the Philippine Coast Guard suspected it was probably just a glitch.\u2014Contributed photo\nSAN ANTONIO, ZAMBALES, Philippines \u2014 Residents of San Felipe town in this province were alarmed on Tuesday after seeing in a marine tracker what appeared to be a China Coast Guard (CCG) vessel near a dredging site.\nLocals who routinely monitor vessels operating in the Sto. Tomas River were taken aback upon detecting a vessel identified as a CCG ship with body No. 21543 approaching the area, according to Elezer Requirme, a resident and beach resort owner.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\n\u201cThere are currently four dredging vessels operating in the area, hauling sand and transporting it to a reclamation site in Manila Bay,\u201d Requirme said in a phone interview.\nFEATURED STORIES\nNEWSINFO\nBar exam 2024: List of successful examinees\nNEWSINFO\n3 schools have highest percentage of passers among first-time bar exam takers\nNEWSINFO\nHouse panel: Ex-president Duterte center of grand criminal enterprise\nHe said the vessel they saw appeared to be a CCG vessel on the tracker.\n\u201cWhen we checked again, it disappeared from the tracker, as though its AIS (automatic identification system) had been turned off,\u201d Requirme said.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nRequirme is among the residents who have been opposed to dredging operations in the province and a member of the group that monitors dredging vessels in Sto. Tomas using a marine tracker app.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nImmediate inspection\nResponding to their concerns, the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) personnel in Zambales immediately boarded all dredging vessels in the area for inspection.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nCmdr. Euphraim Jayson Diciano, chief of the PCG station in Zambales, assured residents that all vessels would be closely monitored, noting that their detection of a suspected CCG vessel may have been just due to a technical glitch.\n\u201cWe have located the vessel of concern and it is currently in Guangzhou, China. It could not have been in San Felipe because if the AIS was turned off, the marine tracker would only display its last known position,\u201d Diciano explained in a phone interview.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nUndocumented crew\nThe Zambales residents raised the matter a day after Sen. Risa Hontiveros also sounded the alarm over possible Chinese espionage using dredging operations as cover.\nIn a privilege speech on Monday, Hontiveros, the Senate deputy minority leader, cited a PCG report on the discovery of 13 undocumented Chinese nationals on the dredging vessel MV Harvest 89 in Mariveles, Bataan province, on Nov. 26.\n\u201cThe PCG personnel were shocked that during a routine predeparture inspection to secure a Masters Declaration of Safe Departure, the crew members attempted to deny them entry,\u201d she said.\n\u201cThe crew members told the PCG that their documentation was okay. Smelling a rat, our coast guards boarded the vessel where they discovered nine undocumented Chinese crew members, and when they searched deeper, they found four more, bringing the total to 13,\u201d the opposition senator added.\n\u2018PLA\u2019 uniform\nWhat\u2019s more shocking, Hontiveros said, was the discovery inside the vessel of a People\u2019s Liberation Army uniform similar to what was found in illegal Philippine offshore gaming operator (Pogo) hubs.\nShe noted that this was not the first time the PCG caught dredging vessels engaged in suspicious activities.\nIn May this year, the PCG also apprehended a vessel pretending to carry a Philippine flag when it was actually registered in Sierra Leone. Its crew members were all Chinese nationals, she said.\n\u201cThe presence of undocumented Chinese nationals aboard a vessel engaged in such contentious operations is a chilling revelation. What were they doing there? Who permitted their entry? Were they acting as laborers, or, as some fear, engaging in activities of an intelligence-gathering nature?\u201d asked Hontiveros.\n\u201cEspionage is not merely the stuff of spy novels. As we have sadly learned due to recent events, it is a clear and present danger in the modern geopolitical landscape. As Nica (National Intelligence Coordinating Agency) had said during our recently concluded Pogo hearings in which a Philippine mayor was confirmed by our intelligence apparatus to be an \u2018agent of influence,\u2019 all regions of our country have been infiltrated by agents of the Chinese Communist Party,\u201d she added.\n\u2018Nasasalisihan tayo\u2019\nHontiveros was referring to Alice Guo, the dismissed mayor of Bamban, Tarlac, who is now detained and facing charges after being linked to an online gaming hub that was raided in her town.\n\u201cWhen foreign nationals operate covertly in our territory, it compromises not only our security apparatus but also the trust of our citizens in the government\u2019s ability to protect them,\u201d she said.\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m scared of is that while we are busy with all that\u2019s happening in our country, our enemies are creeping in (nasasalisihan tayo),\u201d she added.\nIn her speech, Hontiveros said the company behind the dredging activity in Bataan was the China state-run firm China Harbour Engineer Co. (CHEC) which was earlier blacklisted by the United States for its alleged role in the militarization of the South China Sea, as well as by the World Trade Organization for alleged corrupt practices.\nEnvironmental damage\nHontiveros urged the Department of Justice, through the Bureau of Immigration, to investigate the undocumented persons aboard the vessels and review their Alien Employment Certificates issued by the Department of Labor and Employment.\nShe also asked the Department of Environment and Natural Resources to conduct an exhaustive assessment of the environmental damage caused by the dredging operations and hold responsible parties accountable.\nHontiveros said there should also be a review of all existing agreements that permit foreign entities to engage in resource extraction or related activities within Philippine waters to ensure that the agreements align not just with ecological preservation but also with national security.\nYour subscription could not be saved.

        "content": "The jubilant streets of Damascus are awash with a sense of freedom. Women perform the \u201czaghrouta,\u201d a piercing, celebratory ululation; men chant slogans; and the nation collectively breathes a sigh of relief. The fall of Bashar al-Assad and his flight to Moscow signals the end of an era of repression. Yet, amidst the celebrations, the echoes of history remind us that such moments are but the first steps in the arduous journey of transition.\nAssad\u2019s dramatic departure is reminiscent of other despots forced into exile: Ferdinand Marcos Sr. fleeing to Hawaii in 1986, laden with treasures looted from the Philippine people; Muammar Gaddafi\u2019s brutal demise in Libya; and Saddam Hussein\u2019s humiliating fall in Iraq. Each instance of a dictator\u2019s downfall has triggered euphoria, but also exposed deep challenges in the aftermath. For Syria, these challenges loom large, as the nation grapples with the legacies of autocratic rule, civil war, and external meddling.\nFor over 50 years, the Assad family ruled with an iron fist, crushing dissent and maintaining power through a maze of alliances. The civil war that erupted in 2011 triggered heightened repression, leading to decades of unimaginable suffering: hundreds of thousands dead and millions displaced.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nScenes of jubilation in Syria mirror those of the Edsa People Power Revolution in the Philippines, where citizens took to the streets to topple Marcos Sr.\u2019s regime. Just as Filipinos dismantled the vestiges of a dictator\u2019s reign\u2014smashing statues and reclaiming public spaces\u2014Syrians now seize the moment to exorcise symbols of the Assad family\u2019s domination. Yet, while the Philippines managed a relatively swift transition to democratic rule, Syria\u2019s path is far more uncertain.\nFEATURED STORIES\nOPINION\nUrgent action needed vs online piracy as Congress session nears end\nOPINION\nLife has shortened\nOPINION\nThe gift of second chances\nHistory offers cautionary tales for Syria. Libya and Iraq, both torn apart after the fall of autocratic regimes, failed to establish stable political orders. These examples highlight the dangers of power vacuums and unbridled factionalism. Syria\u2019s deeply fragmented opposition, including Islamist groups like Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and Kurdish factions under the Syrian Democratic Forces, is emblematic of these challenges. HTS, despite its pledge to embrace inclusivity, remains burdened by a controversial past with ties to al-Qaida, casting doubt on its ability to foster unity.\nThe stakes are further complicated by Syria\u2019s geopolitical significance. Regional powers such as Turkey, Iran, and Israel, alongside global actors like Russia and the United States, have entrenched themselves in the conflict. Israel\u2019s recent seizure of a buffer zone in the Golan Heights, Turkey\u2019s ongoing skirmishes with Kurdish forces, Russian interests in maintaining influence, and US preemptive strikes to deny weapons caches from remnant ISIS forces, underscore the volatile landscape. Any transition must navigate these external pressures while addressing domestic fissures.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThe nation\u2019s ethnic and sectarian divisions, exacerbated by years of war, require sensitive reconciliation efforts. The abundance of weapons among various factions raises the specter of prolonged violence, as former allies in the fight against the Assad regime may turn on one another. Syria\u2019s infrastructure lies in ruins, and its oil reserves, controlled by Kurdish forces, remain a contentious issue. International aid and investment are essential for rebuilding, but political instability and mistrust could hinder these efforts.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nDespite these challenges, there are reasons for cautious optimism. Rebel leaders have expressed commitments to pluralism and minority rights, signaling a potential departure from the Assad regime\u2019s exclusionary policies. Turkey, despite its complex role in the conflict, sees stability in Syria as a chance to repatriate millions of Syrian refugees. The international community, led by the United Nations, has pledged support for a peaceful transition. Such external engagement, coupled with lessons learned from other post-conflict transitions, could provide a framework for demilitarization, power sharing, and justice.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThe experiences of the Philippines, Libya, and Iraq serve as reminders of the perils and possibilities inherent in regime change. While the fall of Bashar al-Assad is a victory for the Syrian people, the road ahead demands wisdom, resilience, and unity.\nIn the Edsa People Power Revolution, Filipinos found strength in collective action, dismantling martial rule, and reclaiming democracy. Similarly, Syrians now have the opportunity to forge a new identity rooted in inclusivity and justice. The fall of Bashar al-Assad is an opportunity for reinvention, though fraught with risks. The lessons of history caution against complacency. Celebrations must give way to dialogue, and euphoria must be tempered by the hard work of nation-building.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\ndoyromero@gmail.com\nYour subscription could not be saved.

These actions aim to manipulate how people think, weaken democratic institutions, and challenge the country\u2019s sovereignty, creating a serious threat to the Philippines\u2019 stability.\nThe move to ban Pogos is a crucial step toward helping the Philippines exit the Financial Action Task Force\u2019s grey list. Earlier this year, President Marcos instructed relevant government agencies to address the country\u2019s \u201cgrey listing.\u201d The government has set a deadline to exit the grey list by the start of 2024 after missing the original target of January 2023.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nIn the legislature, Sen. Risa Hontiveros, in her published statement during the Senate investigation on online gaming industries, revealed that aside from crimes committed in the country, Pogos might have been used by China for propaganda and \u201cespionage\u201d operations in the Philippines.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nSen. Win Gatchalian said the Pogo industry \u201chas turned the country into a haven for human trafficking, scamming, kidnapping, and other criminalities that have adversely affected many of our people.\u201d\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nWidely lauded was the signing of Executive Order No. 74 on Nov. 5, 2024, signaling a key milestone in the effort to eradicate Pogos.\nThere are also moves to hold Philippine officials, who were found to have encouraged and even benefited from Pogos, accountable for their actions.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nBut what can the Filipino people do about Pogos, especially now that the 2025 elections are approaching?\nAccording to a Pulse Asia Survey in September 2024, 99 percent of Filipinos do not trust China. According to the poll, the United States remains the most trusted partner of Filipinos for national development at 79 percent followed by Japan (50 percent), Canada (43 percent), and Australia (42 percent).\nIt follows that the rejection of pro-China candidates in the May 2025 midterm elections is at 73 percent. Only 5 percent of Filipinos say they \u201cwill support\u201d a pro-China candidate, while 23 percent are ambivalent.\nMeanwhile, a Social Weather Stations (SWS) survey conducted in the same month revealed that fighting corruption, job creation, livelihood generation, and financial literacy are the key components that should be central to a senatorial platform in the 2025 elections.\nThe SWS survey also found that nine out of 10 Filipinos (91 percent) agreed that \u201cgovernment officials involved in corruption must be held accountable.\u201d\nThe issue of Pogos has exposed the weaknesses and vulnerabilities of our systems, especially with foreign influence combined with Filipinos posing as leaders who put their interests above all else. Pogos reveal very deep and alarming issues, and these must be addressed right now before they can do more harm.\nElections are a time for people to be heard. Our people deserve leaders who will put our nation\u2019s interests above all else. Anything less merits their rejection.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\nYour subscription could not be saved.

Associated Press\nCAPE TOWN, South Africa \u2014 President Joe Biden is finally making his long-promised visit to Africa this week, attempting to showcase a U.S.-backed railway project in three countries that he has pushed as a new approach in countering some of China\u2019s global influence.\nBiden\u2019s first visit to the continent as president \u2014 which he left to the very end \u2014 will highlight the Lobito Corridor railway redevelopment in Zambia, Congo and Angola.

The 800-mile (1,300-kilometer), $2.5 billion railway upgrade is a different move and has shades of China\u2019s Belt and Road foreign infrastructure strategy that has surged ahead.\nREAD:\nBiden\u2019s promised visit to Africa shows no signs of happening yet\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThe Biden administration has called the corridor one of the president\u2019s signature initiatives.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nBiden starts a three-day trip to Angola on Monday, yet Lobito\u2019s future and any change in the way the United States engages with a continent of 1.4 billion leaning heavily toward China depends on the incoming administration of Donald Trump.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\n\u201cPresident Biden is no longer the story,\u201d said Mvemba Dizolele, the director of the Africa Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington-based think tank. \u201cEven African leaders are focused on Donald Trump.\u201d\nA fit for Trump\u2019s vision?\nThe U.S. has committed hundreds of millions of dollars to the Lobito Corridor alongside financing from the European Union, the Group of Seven leading industrialized nations, a Western-led private consortium and African banks.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\n\u201cA lot is riding on this in terms of its success and its replicability,\u201d said Tom Sheehy, a fellow at the United States Institute of Peace, a nonpartisan federal research institution.\nREAD:\nBiden fetes Kenyan leader as Africa competition grows\nHe called it one of the flagships for the G7\u2019s new Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment, which was driven by Biden and aims to reach other developing nations as a response to China\u2019s Belt and Road.\nBiden promised to visit Africa last year after reviving the U.S.-Africa Summit for the first time in nearly a decade in December 2022. The trip was kicked back to 2024 and delayed again this October because of Hurricane Milton, reinforcing a sentiment among Africans that their continent is still low priority. The last U.S. president to visit was Barack Obama in 2015.\n\u201cAfrica never gets top attention,\u201d said Witney Schniedman, an expert on African economic growth at the nonprofit Brookings Institution.\nBut many are optimistic that the Lobito project, which isn\u2019t due for completion until well after Biden has left office, will survive a change of administration and be given a chance. It goes some way to blunting China, which has bipartisan backing and is high on Trump\u2019s to-do list.\n\u201cAs long as they keep labeling Lobito one of the main anti-China tools in Africa, there is a certain likelihood that it\u2019s going to keep being funded,\u201d said Christian-G\u00e9raud Neema, who analyzes China-Africa relations.\nSome success in Africa\nThe Lobito Corridor will be an upgrade and extension of a railway line from the copper and cobalt mines of northern Zambia and southern Congo to Angola\u2019s Atlantic Ocean port of Lobito, a route west for Africa\u2019s critical minerals.\nIt\u2019s little more than a starting point for the U.S. and its partners, because China is dominant in the mining in Zambia and Congo. Congo has more than 70% of the world\u2019s cobalt, most of which is heading to China to reinforce its critical mineral supply chain that the U.S. and Europe have to rely on.\nLobito was made possible by some American diplomatic success in Angola that led to a Western consortium winning the bid for the project in 2022 ahead of Chinese competition, a surprise given Angola\u2019s long and strong ties with Beijing. China financed a previous redevelopment of the railway.\nThe Biden administration accelerated American outreach to Angola, turning around what was an antagonistic relationship three decades ago when the U.S. armed anti-government rebels in Angola\u2019s civil war. U.S.-Angola trade was $1.77 billion last year, while the U.S. has a stronger stake in regional security through a strategic presence on the Atlantic Ocean, and Angolan President Jo\u00e3o Louren\u00e7o\u2019s role mediating in a conflict in eastern Congo.\nIn Angola, Biden will announce new developments on health, agribusiness, security cooperation as well as the Lobito Corridor, White House officials said on a preview call with reporters.\nThe visit, the first by a sitting U.S. president to Angola, will \u201chighlight that remarkable evolution of the U.S.-Angola relationship,\u201d Frances Brown, a special assistant to the president and senior director for African affairs at the National Security Council, said on a separate call.\nIt will also draw attention to a perennial challenge for America\u2019s value-based diplomacy in Africa. International rights groups have used Biden\u2019s trip to criticize the Louren\u00e7o government\u2019s authoritarian shift. Political opponents have been imprisoned and allegedly tortured, while security and other laws have been passed in Angola that severely restrict freedoms, throwing some scrutiny on Washington\u2019s new African partnership.\nWill the US really show up?\nThose calling for more U.S. presence in Africa say Angola and the Lobito spinoff show what might be achieved, even with China-facing countries, if the U.S. is willing to consistently engage. But they see signs for Africa when China has held a summit with African leaders every three years since 2000, while the US has had just two summits, in 2014 and 2022, and there are no plans for the next one.\nMichelle Gavin, a former U.S. ambassador to Botswana and adviser on Africa to Obama, said that the U.S. had failed to take Africa seriously over multiple administrations, a bipartisan trend. She doesn\u2019t see Biden\u2019s visit and Lobito being a major \u201cinflection point\u201d that will drive a new U.S. focus across Africa.\nYour subscription could not be saved.

Paolo Duterte at the Batasang Pambansa building in Quezon City, the Vice President said she faced mortal danger from the Speaker of the House.\nShe said she told the House sergeant-at-arms, retired police Maj. Gen. Napoleon Taas, that she didn\u2019t need any extra security personnel as she had brought her own.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\n\u201cIf anything happens to me here inside (the House), there is only one person who wants to kill me, and that\u2019s (Speaker) Martin Romualdez,\u201d she said.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nBut she added: \u201cI don\u2019t think he will do that here inside. He will do it outside.\u201d\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nRomualdez on Thursday called out Duterte for sending her officials instead of herself to explain to lawmakers her use of P612.5 million in confidential funds of the OVP and the Department of Education when she was still the education secretary from 2022 to 2023.\n\u201cShe should now appear, take the oath, speak and explain,\u201d Romualdez told reporters in Butuan City on Thursday. \u201cShe shouldn\u2019t let her officials at the OVP and DepEd handle (the explanations).\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nShe should be the one to speak.\u201d\nOvernight stay\nAccording to House officials, Duterte made the move to place herself inside the House on Thursday night, arriving at the Batasang Pambansa in Quezon City around 7:40 p.m. supposedly to visit Lopez, who was cited for contempt and ordered detained a day earlier.\nLopez, 50, who had twice served as Davao City administrator when Duterte was the city mayor, was cited for her \u201cevasive\u201d answers to a House inquiry into the Vice President\u2019s use of confidential funds and for \u201cundue interference\u201d in the House\u2019s oversight function by telling the Commission on Audit (COA) not to hand over audit reports on the funds to the committee looking into the spending of the OVP.\nAfter detention visits ended at 10 p.m. on Thursday, Duterte refused to leave the House and locked herself inside the office of her brother, Davao Rep. Paolo Duterte, where she stayed overnight, according to Taas.\nHouse Secretary General Reginald Velasco said that Duterte and her staff remained in her brother\u2019s office and refused to leave even after they had shut down power, which the House normally does ahead of the long weekend as its offices are closed from Friday to Sunday.\nIn a statement on Friday, Senior Deputy Speaker Aurelio Gonzales Jr., Majority Leader Manuel Jose Dalipe and Deputy Speaker David Suarez denounced Duterte\u2019s brazen disrespect of the chamber and her serious breach of security.\n\u201cNo matter how many times she was asked by our House sergeant-at-arms to leave, she has ignored it,\u201d they said. \u201cIf she does not have respect for simple rules, how can we trust that she is able to respect the bigger responsibilities she must do as an elected public official?\u201d\nManila Rep. Joel Chua, who heads the House committee on good government and accountability investigating Duterte\u2019s alleged misuse of confidential funds as Vice President when she was education secretary, said at a press conference that he had denied Duterte\u2019s request to stay with Lopez inside the House detention facility.\nRequest denied\nIn a Nov. 21 letter to Chua, Vice President Duterte appealed on humanitarian grounds to stay with Lopez, expressing concern for her chief of staff\u2019s health and well-being.\nShe listed down, among others, Lopez\u2019s chronic back problems, nausea, lightheadedness, and fears for her safety.\nChua rejected her request, citing the strict rules of the Office of the Sergeant-at-Arms (Osaa) regarding detention, adding that the facility was exclusively for detainees.\nBut Duterte pressed on, stating in another letter on Friday her intent to visit Lopez daily \u201cfor the full period of her detention\u201d according to the guidelines of the Osaa pertaining to persons under House custody.\nDuring her Zoom press conference, Duterte was asked why she was evading the House probe. She replied that the House was imposing \u201cunconstitutional\u201d rules in its hearings and planned to legally challenge its investigation.\n\u201cThey have no investigatorial, prosecutorial powers, and they must respect the rights of people appearing,\u201d she said.\nThe Vice President said she was consulting her lawyers regarding the possibility of taking the legislators to court and that \u201cthey are ready\u201d to file cases against House members.\nBrother lets her stay\nHer brother informed Chua in a letter that he had given her permission to \u201cstay indefinitely in my office to discharge her day-to-day duties.\u201d\n\u201cThe Vice President\u2019s stay will also correspond to her visits to (Lopez) and other OVP personnel currently detained,\u201d he said, adding that she was \u201camenable\u201d to staying there even without water and electricity.\nThe Vice President told reporters that she could stay in her brother\u2019s office until New Year\u2019s Day.\nChua, sounding exasperated, asked whether \u201cwe need to remind the Vice President to follow the law.\u201d\n\u201cOur Vice President is a lawyer, she is the second-highest official of the land. We took an oath of service which stated that we will follow the rules of the land,\u201d Chua said.\nPlay for sympathy\nOther lawmakers also condemned Duterte\u2019s actions which they said was an attempt to influence the proceedings against her and even curry public sympathy for her as she continued to dodge the hearings into her confidential fund use.\nZambales Rep. Jay Khonghun said he couldn\u2019t help \u201cbut be suspicious of her motives of offering to join her chief of staff in detention,\u201d saying that she might just want to stop Lopez from testifying once the committee resumes its inquiry on Monday.\n\u201cOr is this just for show, another attempt at heroics? \u2026 Is this the Duterte brand?\u201d he asked. \u201cWhy is their behavior bereft of respect? Why act like a brat?\u201d\nACT Teachers Rep. France Castro also questioned Duterte\u2019s \u201cselective appearance\u201d at the House.\n\u201cIf she has nothing to hide, why doesn\u2019t she face us? Her continued absence from our hearings while finding time for other House visits only reinforces public doubt about the use of these funds,\u201d she said.\nDavao origins\nDuterte attended a hearing called by the quad committee on Nov. 13 to show solidarity with her father, former President Rodrigo Duterte, whose brutal drug war was under investigation.\nThis time, she literally stayed in the House to show support for Lopez.\nLopez, a niece of former Mayor Elias Lopez, first entered the Davao City government service as city council secretary in 2007, when Duterte first ran and won as vice mayor in the city.\nWhen Duterte won as mayor in 2010, she picked Lopez as her city administrator.\nLopez gained the reputation of a no-nonsense executive.\nREAD:\nHouse orders transfer of VP Duterte\u2019s aide to women\u2019s prison\nAmong her earliest directives was a dress code at City Hall, where people from the far-flung villages used to be at ease and were welcomed wearing only their slippers when the older Duterte was the city mayor.\nIn 2013, when her father again ran for mayor, Duterte withdrew from politics and went full time into her private legal practice.\nShe again picked Lopez as her city administrator when she won again as mayor and her father became President in 2016.\nYour subscription could not be saved.

        "content": "The recent election of Donald Trump as President of the United States is set to significantly influence the electronics industry, a sector already navigating the complexities of global trade, supply chain management, and technological innovation. As Trump begins his second term, the implications for this vital industry are multifaceted, encompassing trade policies, regulatory changes, and shifts in international relations, particularly with China.\nTrade policies and tariffs. One of the most immediate impacts of Trump\u2019s presidency on the electronics industry will likely stem from his approach to trade. During his first term, Trump implemented a series of tariffs aimed at reducing the trade deficit and protecting American manufacturing. These tariffs, particularly on Chinese imports, have already reshaped the landscape for electronics manufacturers.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nIn his second term, Trump has proposed even more aggressive tariffs, including a potential 60-percent tariff on all goods from China. Such measures could drastically increase costs for electronics companies that rely on Chinese manufacturing for components and finished products. The Consumer Technology Association has warned that these tariffs could lead to significant price increases for consumers, with estimates suggesting that laptop prices could nearly double and smartphones could see a 26-percent increase. This scenario poses a substantial risk to consumer electronics affordability and could dampen overall market demand.\nFEATURED STORIES\nOPINION\nUrgent action needed vs online piracy as Congress session nears end\nOPINION\nLife has shortened\nOPINION\nThe gift of second chances\nSupply chain disruptions. The electronics industry is characterized by complex global supply chains that depend on the seamless flow of components across borders. The potential for heightened tariffs may force manufacturers to seek alternative suppliers or relocate production, which could disrupt established relationships and increase operational costs.\nAs companies navigate these challenges, they may also face delays in production and delivery, further complicating their ability to meet consumer demand. The uncertainty surrounding trade policies could lead to a more cautious approach to investment in new technologies and product development, as companies weigh the risks of potential tariff impacts against the need for innovation.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nRegulatory environment and innovation. Trump\u2019s administration has historically favored deregulation, which could have mixed implications for the electronics industry. On one hand, reduced regulatory burdens may foster innovation and allow companies to operate more freely. However, this approach could also lead to a lack of oversight in critical areas such as data privacy and cybersecurity, raising concerns among consumers and advocacy groups.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThe electronics sector, particularly in areas like artificial intelligence and data management, may experience a shift in regulatory focus. Trump\u2019s administration has indicated a desire to dismantle existing frameworks that govern technology development, potentially leading to a more laissez-faire environment. While this could spur rapid advancements in certain technologies, it may also create risks related to consumer protection and ethical considerations.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThe future of the CHIPS Act. The CHIPS and Science Act, passed during the Biden administration, aims to bolster the US semiconductor manufacturing and reduce reliance on foreign supply chains. During his campaign, Trump criticized the CHIPS Act, labeling it as \u201cso bad\u201d and suggesting that tariffs would be more effective for manufacturing than the funding provided by the act.\nWhile some experts express concern about potential repeal efforts, others believe that Trump may recognize the bipartisan support for the CHIPS Act and its importance for American manufacturing. The semiconductor industry has seen significant investments due to the act, particularly in states like Arizona, where companies like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Limited and Intel are expanding operations. If Trump chooses to modify rather than repeal the CHIPS Act, there may be opportunities to streamline funding processes or expand the scope of the Act to include energy generation, given the high energy demands of semiconductor manufacturing. This could lead to a more robust framework that supports both semiconductor production and sustainable energy initiatives.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThe projected impact of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency on the electronics industry is complex and multifaceted. His proposed trade policies, particularly aggressive tariffs, could lead to significant price increases for consumers and disrupt established supply chains. While deregulation may foster innovation, it also raises concerns about consumer protection and ethical considerations.\nAs the industry navigates these challenges, companies will need to remain agile and responsive to the evolving landscape. The ability to adapt to changing trade dynamics, regulatory environments, and consumer preferences will be crucial for success in an increasingly competitive and uncertain world. The future of the electronics industry will depend on how well it can balance the pressures of cost, innovation, and ethical responsibility in the face of a shifting political landscape.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\nArthur Tan was president of Ayala chipmaker, IMI for 23 years.

        "content": "I saw many posts online about Dominican Fr. Gustavo Guti\u00e9rrez, proudly Peruvian, popularly known as one of the fathers of liberation theology, who died on Oct. 22 at the age of 96. I thought, why don\u2019t I post mine, too, my one-on-one interview with him in 2000, the turn of the century, when he visited the Philippines. He was 72 then. Someone like him might not come this way again when the world is in a mess, politically, environmentally, culturally and the so-called happiness index in some parts has plummeted.\nThe influence of this man\u2019s revolutionary ideas, of his life as a priest, theologian, and action man went beyond the Catholic Church. Who was Guti\u00e9rrez that grassroots development workers both in the church and secular setting were so inspired by him?\nFirst let me say that community organizing among the poor and oppressed had four key influences: theology of liberation for which Guti\u00e9rrez was known, Saul Alinsky (conflict resolution), Paulo Freire (pedagogy of the oppressed and Marxist analysis).\nArticle continues after this advertisement\n\u201cPoverty is the first violence,\u201d he said to me. I was dumbstruck. Suddenly the word \u201cpoor\u201d took on a new nuance especially because he kept referring to them as \u201cthe last ones.\u201d But wait. He also spoke about poverty as a way of life that could be embraced, not only by those in the so-called consecrated life but also by those of us right smack in the heart of a messy, consumerist world. Here goes:\nFEATURED STORIES\nOPINION\nUrgent action needed vs online piracy as Congress session nears end\nOPINION\nLife has shortened\nOPINION\nThe gift of second chances\n\u201cPoverty is an act of love and liberation. It has a redemptive value. If the ultimate cause of human exploitation and alienation is selfishness, the deepest reason for voluntary poverty is love of neighbor. Christian poverty has meaning only as a commitment of solidarity with the poor who suffer misery and injustice. The commitment is to witness to the evil which has resulted from the sin and is a breach of communion.\n\u201cIt is not a question of idealizing poverty, but rather of taking it on as it is\u2014an evil\u2014to protest against it and to struggle to avoid it \u2026 It is poverty lived not for its own sake, but rather as an authentic imitation of Christ, it is poverty which means taking on the sinful human condition to liberate humankind from sin and all its consequences.\u201d\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nHe defined theology as \u201ca way to speak on God, a language of God\u201d and that liberation theology is \u201cnot a sociological or economic program\u201d but something that addresses the consciousness in order to change it. The consequence of this is solidarity with the poor and helping them to not accept poverty as fate.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nMy take from left field: In this 21st-century landscape and in speaking of the poor, let us stop idealizing \u201cFilipino resilience\u201d as the gold standard of virtues.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nFor those squeamish about liberation theology because it had been wrongly associated with Marxism, Guti\u00e9rrez said that \u201cpeople today are in a better position to understand our theology.\u201d There was never any mention of armed struggled in his writings, he stressed. \u201cWe have affirmed this and the Latin American bishops have affirmed his. It is not a justification for any other violence.\u201d So, comprende?\nBut, indeed, there was a time when some church elements misunderstood liberation theology. Even a United States report did say that liberation theology was dangerous to US foreign policy. This twisted thinking must have had a bearing on the killings of priests and nuns by right-wing military regimes.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThe major source of liberation theology is the Bible, Gutierrez reminded. \u201cIt is the effort of liberation theology to read the Bible from the concrete situation of poor persons.\u201d My sneaky retort: \u201cAre top guys in the church not reading it that way?\u201d He singled out models who got it right: the assassinated bishop of El Salvador \u00d3scar Romero (now a canonized saint) and Brazil\u2019s Dom H\u00e9lder C\u00e2mara.\nThe Bible, he said, is not to be read the way we read a beautiful book but from the point of the poor of history. We miss out on this, he said, because we tend to think of religion as without so many requirements. \u201cWe like a quiet religion,\u201d he added, \u201cthat revolved around our little lives,\u201d when, in fact, the whole view of the Bible is from the point of view of those who are considered the last, the insignificant (\u201cinsinyeeficant,\u201d he would say) because of class, color, gender, culture. (In our context, it is ang mga nasa laylayan ng lipunan.)\nWhat does his priesthood mean to him? \u201cService of God and the poor,\u201d he replied. \u201cIt is one way, not the only way. It is not necessarily better, it is \u201cdee-ferrrent.\u201d Better depends on the quality of commitment, \u201cnot on my status as a priest.\u201d\nDid he have favorite biblical figures, the great prophets perhaps who railed against oppressors? He had many, he said, but this time he singled out the Book of Job in the Old Testament to stress a point. It is about justice and \u201cthe gratuitous love of God.\u201d Matthew 25, too, he added. The heart-stopping last portion, methinks. Read it.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nYour subscription could not be saved.

Should we care about how the US election is shaping up?\nThe answer, and perhaps the safest answer: We should, at least, monitor it.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nA military ally in the West Philippine Sea\nThe United States is one of the allies\u2013if not the primary ally\u2013of the Philippines in our fight for sovereignty in the West Philippine Sea.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nDue to recent aggression by China against Philippine vessels in West Philippine Sea, proposals to invoke the Mutual Defense Treaty (MDT) between Manila and Washington have grown louder.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThe MDT is a 73-year old military agreement between Manila and Washington which calls for each other\u2019s defense in case of an armed attack\u2013including in the West Philippine Sea.\n\u201cThe US election will certainly impact the geopolitical fate of two allied states on how they will address issues on asymmetrical trade and security in the Indo-Pacific region,\u201d Dr. Chester Cabalza, president and founder of Manila-based think tank International Development and Security Cooperation, told INQUIRER.net.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThe MDT, however, is not the only military agreement the Philippines has with the US.\nThis year alone, four new locations were identified as additional sites for the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (Edca), not to mention the annual military exercises and joint patrols between Manila and Washington in Philippine waters.\nEdca allows the US to rotate troops in the Philippines for extended stays and the US to build and operate facilities on Philippine bases for both American and Philippine forces.\nAccording to Cabalza, a leadership change in the US may be a \u201cboon and bane\u201d for Philippines security, especially with standing agreements the two countries have.\n\u201cAs a friend of the US, Filipinos should see the electoral change in the White House as a boon and bane if Washington will fulfill its treaty obligations with Manila as both countries mutually expanded naval and aerial bases in northern and western parts of the Philippines,\u201d Cabalza said.\nSo when the election is over, what will happen to the Philippines?\nA Harris win may simply mean a continuation of the working relationship between Manila and Washington, taking off from the relationship between the administration of President Bongbong Marcos and the administration of US President Joe Biden.\nIn September 2023, Marcos and Harris met on the sidelines of the 43rd Association of Southeast Asian Nations Summit in Jakarta where among the issues they discussed was the West Philippine Sea. During their meeting, Harris reaffirmed the US\u2019 ironclad commitment to the Philippines.\nThe doubts, however, arise from a possible Trump win.\nCabalza said he fears that Trump may lessen his focus on the West Philippine Sea and direct it to other conflicts in other parts of the globe.\n\u201cWith Trump\u2019s triumph, he may compartmentalize his foreign policy and lessen his focus on the West Philippine Sea as he will give more importance to current wars in Ukraine and Gaza,\u201d Cabalza said.\n\u201cHis comeback will also change the contours and the security landscape in the region as he may halt the defense developments in the Edca sites,\u201d he added.\nGeopolitical analyst and De La Salle University Department of International Studies lecturer Don McLain Gill pointed out that during Trump\u2019s term as president of the US, there were also attempts to strengthen Washington\u2019s relationship with Manila.\nHowever, then Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte pivoted towards China and gave cold shoulder treatment to the US, not allowing the Philippines to maximize its negotiations with the Trump administration.\n\u201cThe Trump administration also rejected a huge percentage of China\u2019s expansionist claims over the South China Sea and the West Philippine Sea, in particular. In that regard, we could see how the Philippine-US alliance was significant,\u201d Gill told INQUIRER.net.\nGill, however, noted the stark difference between the foreign policy of Duterte, who aligned himself with China, and Marcos, who was more open to working with the US.\n\u201cWith Marcos Jr. however, I see a foreign policy that positions the Philippines as a proactive hub for like-minded cooperation as well as the Philippines\u2019 position in wanting to be a more proactive stakeholder in the rules-based order of the Indo-Pacific. I think that converges well with the Trump administration,\u201d Gill added.\nNonetheless, Gill stressed that there are still concerns over a Trump re-election, especially with the \u201cnegotiation-driven approach\u201d of the former US president.\nWill Manila still be a priority for Trump?\nGill said he believes that the Indo-Pacific region will still be a \u201cclear\u201d priority for Trump, given the escalating tension between the US and China.\n\u201cThis would rely on Manila\u2019s ability to present itself as an important stakeholder and important element in the Indo-Pacific geopolitics because we are a frontliner state. We are acutely affected by the US-China power competition. It\u2019s up to how we are able to convey that message to a Trump administration,\u201d Gill said.\n\u201cWe cannot just expect without making more of an effort in the negotiations and dialogues with the US as well,\u201d he added.\nFor now, only time can tell what will happen with US-Philippines ties should Trump win, although it is important to note that Philippine Ambassador to the United States Jose Manuel Romualdez stressed that the MDT will remain unchanged, regardless of who becomes the next US president.\nRomualdez said that while a Trump comeback could bring shifts in economic policy, the defense relations between Manila and Washington would remain intact.\nFilipinos in the US\nWhile results of the US elections may not directly impact Filipinos here in the Philippines, these could affect millions of Filipinos residing in the States.\nAs of 2022, there are about 4.1 million Filipino-Americans living in the US, according to data from the US Census Bureau.\nImmigration is one of the issues at the forefront of the US presidential elections.\nA Pew Research Center report states that about 61 percent of US voters say immigration is very important to their vote. This figure is a 9 percentage point increase from the 2020 presidential election.\nHarris is pushing for comprehensive immigration reforms, such as providing pathways to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.\nThe vice president also said in a visit to Arizona in September that anyone crossing the border illegally would be barred from seeking asylum in the US. But \u201chard-working migrants\u201d who come to the US legally should be given a pathway to citizenship, she said.\nIf there\u2019s one issue that has served as a cornerstone of the Trump campaign, it is immigration.\nIf he is successful in staging a comeback to the White House, Trump intends to initiate what he calls as the \u201cbiggest domestic deportation operation in US history.\u201d\nThe proposal will affect millions of undocumented individuals in the US, including undocumented Filipinos.\nIn 2017, the Philippine government prepared for the deportation of some 10,000 Filipinos who may be evicted from the US after the Trump administration rescinds a program that allows undocumented immigrant children to stay legally there.\nTrump\u2019s immigration policy may also limit opportunities for Filipinos who wish to try their luck in the US.\n\u201c[This could affect] those who want to pursue a career path or education in the US. With immigration tighter or new immigration policies or longer bureaucratic processes could significantly impact the social aspect of the people-to-people relationship between the US and the Philippines,\u201d Gill said.\nFor context, an INQUIRER.net report states that in 2022, the Philippines ranked as one of the leading countries of origin for immigrants to the United States, representing a notable four percent of the total immigrant population.\nUS-China\u2026 and the Philippines\nRegardless of who wins the US presidential elections, the power struggle between the US and China will continue\u2013and caught in the middle is the Philippines.\n\u201cThe US remains as the strongest state in hard and soft powers that\u2019s why the Philippines and the world have strategic interests in its current election,\u201d Cabalza said.\nAccording to Cabalza, the election of a new US leader will affect global geopolitics and economy, as well as whether the US will maintain its superpower role in the world, especially with the rising threat of China.\n\u201cIt matters to all of us, as the world order may see sudden alteration under the new leader of the US,\u201d Cabalza said.\nThe fact is, whatever happens between the US and China will have an impact on other countries, but more so on the Philippines which is geographically near China.\nGeopolitically speaking, the Philippines is also at the intersection of the traditional sphere of US influence and the emergence of China\u2019s power projection, according to Gill. Thus, a radical change in the global power structure will have an impact on the Philippines.\nGill explained that China\u2019s challenges and expansionist ambitions in the West Philippine Sea have become an \u201cexistential threat\u201d to the Philippines, which relies on the US as a security partner.\n\u201cIf the US would decrease its involvement, that could be a problem for our overarching foreign policy security calculations given that the US is our traditional security provider and traditional ally,\u201d Gill said.\nShould China also challenge the US over Taiwan, the northern part of the Philippines, which is only a few nautical miles away from Taiwan, will also be immediately affected.\nThis concern is on top of the more than 200,000 overseas Filipino workers in Taiwan, Gill added.\nThis brings us back to a question in this long and arduous journey: Should the Philippines care about what\u2019s happening in the US?\nYour subscription could not be saved.

Payne\u2019s 2017 single \u201cStrip That Down,\u201d featuring Quavo, reached the Billboard Top 10, and stayed on the charts for several months. He put out&nbsp;\nan album \u201cLP1\u201d\n&nbsp;in 2019, and his last release \u2014 a single called \u201cTeardrops\u201d \u2014 was released in March.\nIn 2020, to mark the 10th anniversary of One Direction, Payne shared a screenshot of a text message he sent to his father on the day he joined the group, which read: \u201cI\u2019m in a boyband.\u201d\n\u201cWhat a journey\u2026 I had no idea what we were in for when I sent this text to my dad years ago at this exact time the band was formed,\u201d he wrote.\nPayne had a&nbsp;\n7-year-old son, Bear Grey Payne,\n&nbsp;with his former girlfriend, the&nbsp;\nmusician Cheryl\n&nbsp;who was known as Cheryl Cole when she performed with Girls Aloud.\nShe was an \u201cX Factor\u201d judge during One Direction\u2019s season, although their relationship began years later.

Nowadays, it\u2019s becoming more expensive due to rising maintenance and insurance costs.&nbsp;\nThe United States has been deploying autonomous vehicles for ride-hailing services, such as Waymo.\nTesla CEO Elon Musk even promised his upcoming robotaxis will let their owners earn passive income.&nbsp;\nHe claimed they\u2019ll ferry passengers while their owners are busy so that they can earn money.\nHowever, artificial intelligence needs further improvement before self-driving cars become a major part of the global economy.\n3. Financial services\nFree stock photo from Unsplash\nMore apps are deploying AI investment and financial advisors to deliver more personalized recommendations.&nbsp;\nFor example, Google says AI can study customer journeys, peer interactions, and financial goals to suggest financial products and services.&nbsp;\nMany apps have been providing such services, but they\u2019ve become more convenient due to Large language models (LLMs).\nThese AI models allow these mobile programs to understand natural language, letting users describe their needs as if speaking with a real person.&nbsp;\nThey can also analyze documents to help financial institutions find investment opportunities and offer more suitable loans to clients.&nbsp;\nNonetheless, more consumer trust and stronger regulations are necessary to integrate AI into the financial sector safely and effectively.\n4. Retail and consumer\nFree stock photo from Unsplash\nAI-powered recommendations are also present in online shopping apps.&nbsp;\nNowadays, artificial intelligence allows these programs to push products and services that likely meet shoppers\u2019 demands.\nAs a result, the platforms earn more and consumers receive better customer service.&nbsp;\nThese technologies may also guide online businesses to improve their offerings after analyzing consumer trends.\nBusinesses can create AI-generated mockups to test products and services before pushing them to market. Consequently, it could reduce waste from product development.\nFor example, this Inquirer Tech\narticle\nreported a Filipino student who created stunning AI-generated dresses based on local myths.\nUS-based online shopping cloud platform SellersCommerce says over 33% of the world\u2019s population shops online.&nbsp;\nAs a result, AI\u2019s impact on eCommerce will inevitably affect the global economy.\n5. Technology, communications, and entertainment\nFree stock photo from Unsplash\nArtificial intelligence is making it easier to recommend the most suitable content to viewers.&nbsp;\nThis strategy is now common in online platforms like YouTube and TikTok. Moreover, AI helps these platforms organize content and monitor revenue generation.\nThis benefit trickles down to content creators, who use AI-assisted insights to provide more content that appeals to their audiences.&nbsp;\nSouth Korea takes this to the next level by creating online performers with artificial intelligence.\nThis\narticle\nexplains how tech company Pulse9 created the first-ever AI-generated K-pop group, Eternity.\n6.

AI systems could adapt to production changes, letting owners predict and control their outputs.&nbsp;\nConsequently, artificial intelligence could reduce costly delays, defects, or deviations from product specifications.&nbsp;\nThe AI boom has also caused countries to develop proprietary AI systems, which the tech giant Nvidia calls \u201csovereign AI.\u201d&nbsp;\nNvidia defines it as \u201ca nation\u2019s capabilities to produce artificial intelligence using its own infrastructure, data, workforce, and business networks.\u201d\nLearn more about this AI race\nhere\n.\n7.

Consequently, companies are investing in various sources that could meet this demand.&nbsp;\nFor example, Google signed an agreement with Kairos Power. It will develop small nuclear reactors and then Google will purchase their energy output.&nbsp;\nLearn more about this collaboration\nhere\n.\n8. Transport and logistics\nFree stock photo from Unsplash\nPwC says autonomous trucking could reduce transportation costs for companies, reducing costs and increasing asset utilization.&nbsp;\nAI-assisted trucking could also disrupt transportation and logistics as new companies may offer such services.\nMoreover, large online retailers may spread AI T&amp;L into their branches, fueling demand for these smaller providers.&nbsp;\nThe MIT Sloan School of Management says artificial intelligence could learn from logistics data to better monitor and adjust supply chains.&nbsp;\nIn turn, companies could become more resilient to sudden supply disruptions, consistently delivering goods regardless of such changes.\nA closer look into AI\u2019s impact on the global economy\nDaron Acemoglu writes a Letter from America \u2018AI and economic growth: Dreams versus theory\u2019 in the latest RES Quarterly Newsletter \u2013 Issue 205, April 2024.\nRead more\ud83d\udc49\nhttps://t.co/IZjfefIooe\n#EconTwitter\n#economy\n#news\n#membership\n#AI\npic.twitter.com/rIMrLYPaGv\n\u2014 Royal Economic Society (@RoyalEconSoc)\nApril 16, 2024\nThe overwhelming hype for AI\u2019s transformative effects can be overwhelming as multiple sources report on them 24/7.\nFortunately, Nobel-winning economist Daron Acemoglu offered a more clear-minded take on the ongoing trend.&nbsp;\nIn an interview with MIT News, he cited a paper from Economic Policy called \u201cThe Simple Macroeconomics of AI.\u201d&nbsp;\nIt says AI will produce a \u201cmodest increase\u201d in GDP between 1.1% to 1.6% over the next decade. Also, it will produce a 0.05% annual productivity growth.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we should belittle 0.5 percent in 10 years.

In this interview, Chef Cza, who recently won the 2024 Mansmith Young Market Masters Awards (YMMA), shares with us her approach to market-driving strategy, product innovation and building a strong consumer brand.\nQuestion: What inspired you to choose avocado as the central ingredient for your product line, and how did you identify the market potential for avocado-based products?\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nAnswer: Avocado is my favorite fruit, and I\u2019ve always been amazed by its versatility and health benefits. In the Philippines, however, I noticed a significant lack of demand for avocados, leaving our local avocado farmers underappreciated. I identified the market potential by observing growing global trends toward healthier, plant-based foods and recognizing that there was an opportunity to elevate our farmers while meeting consumer demand for nutritious options. By engaging with potential customers and conducting informal surveys, I saw a genuine interest in healthy, avocado-based products that could fill the gap in the local market.\nFEATURED STORIES\nBUSINESS\nMore foreign brands seen coming to PH shores in 2025\nBUSINESS\nGlobal Dominion: Simplifying financing to empower every Filipino\nBUSINESS\nInternational group kicks off infrastructure investment drive for PH\nQ: Avocados were traditionally seen as a seasonal product. How have you managed to mitigate supply risk to ensure consistent availability year round?\nA: To ensure a steady supply of avocados throughout the year, we\u2019ve formed strong partnerships with local farmers as well as with the leading supplier. This collaboration allows us to source avocados directly from farmers, ensuring freshness while supporting local agriculture. We also implement careful planning and forecast demand, which helps us coordinate harvesting and distribution effectively, even during off seasons.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nQ: What challenges did you face in shifting consumer perceptions around avocado-based products, and how did you overcome them?\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nA: One of the main challenges was addressing misconceptions about avocado-based products, particularly the concerns surrounding organic ingredients and preservatives. To overcome this, we focused on transparency in our marketing. We shared the story of our sourcing process and highlighted that our products are 100-percent organic and free from preservatives. Engaging content on social media\u2014such as behind-the-scenes looks at our production and interactive discussions\u2014has helped educate our audience and build trust in our brand.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nREAD:\nPH sends maiden shipment of hass avocados to Japan\nQ: What has been your most popular product, and why do you think it resonates so well with your customers?\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nA: Our most popular product is the \u201cAvocado Lover\u201d dessert. It features a base of avocado ice cream paired with tapioca pearls, homemade biscuits and topped with mixed seeds, homemade condensed milk and fresh avocado chunks. This unique combination creates an explosion of flavors and textures that customers adore. I believe its success is due to the harmony of its ingredients and the innovative take on a classic dessert, which has captured the hearts\u2014and taste buds\u2014of many.\nQ: Avocadoria\u2019s offerings are unique in the market. How do you stay ahead of trends and continue to innovate in the food and beverage industry?\nA: At Avocadoria, we prioritize staying ahead of market trends through continuous research and development. By monitoring consumer preferences, emerging health trends and food innovations, we are able to adapt and refine our offerings. We also encourage feedback from our customers, which fuels our creativity and helps us understand what they want. This commitment to innovation ensures that we remain a leader in the avocado-based product space.\nQ: As a YMMA awardee, what advice do you have for aspiring food entrepreneurs who want to turn a passion into a scalable business?\nA: My advice would be to focus on three key areas:\nQuality: Ensure that your product or service stands out in terms of quality and offers something unique that isn\u2019t readily available in the market. Passion should drive innovation and the continual improvement of your offering.\nUnderstand the market: Conduct thorough market research to understand your target audience, competition and industry trends. This will allow you to position your product effectively and tailor your marketing strategies to reach your potential customers more effectively.\nPlan for scalability: This includes efficient production methods, scalable distribution channels and a flexible business model that can adapt to changes in the market or customer preferences.\nQ: How do you see Avocadoria growing in the next few years, and what\u2019s next for the brand?\nA: I envision Avocadoria experiencing significant growth in the coming years, with plans for international expansion. Our goal is to attract more master franchisees, allowing us to share our love for avocados on a global scale. Ultimately, I aspire for Avocadoria to be recognized as the premier avocado brand from the Philippines, showcasing the richness of our local produce and the creativity of our avocado-made product offerings to the world.\n\u2014Contributed&nbsp;\nYour subscription could not be saved.

That amount of NPLs was 16.66 percent higher compared with a year ago.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nAs it is, the proportion of bad debts held by banks has yet to return to the prepandemic level of 2.04 percent recorded at the end of 2019.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nLeonardo Lanzona, economist at Ateneo De Manila University, said the higher NPL ratio in October might have been a result of banks\u2019 \u201caggressive\u201d lending strategy amid the ongoing easing cycle of the BSP, which potentially increased their exposure to \u201crisky\u201d borrowers.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\n\u201dAs interest in loans became cheaper, lenders may have provided loans without robust risk assessments, thus resulting in lending to borrowers with low creditworthiness,\u201d he said.\nAt present, the benchmark rate that banks typically use as a guide when charging interest on loans stood at 6 percent following two quarter-point cuts each at the last August and October meetings of the Monetary Board. And a third reduction is likely on the table this month after the economy posted weaker-than-expected growth in the third quarter.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nBut beyond the rate cuts, Lanzona also said the powerful typhoons that hit the country in October and affected livelihoods might have made debt servicing more difficult for some borrowers.\nTo shield their balance sheets from credit losses, BSP figures showed banks set aside P487.52 billion as a provision for unpaid loans in October. That brought the NPL coverage ratio \u2014 a measure of the sufficiency of such buffer funds \u2014 at 92.98 percent, albeit lower than the 93.31 percent recorded in September.\nYour subscription could not be saved.

        "content": "Make America Great Again! (MAGA)\u201d\nSo goes the campaign slogan of reelected United States President Donald Trump. Interestingly, it isn\u2019t all that original since a similar one was used back in 1965 by then Sen. Ferdinand E. Marcos Sr. during his successful march to his first term as Philippine president.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nWith Trump\u2019s imminent assumption of office, the air is rife with speculations on how he would actually translate his campaign slogan into reality via specific programs, legislative proposals, and foreign policy. From the thrust of statements he\u2019s been making, it seems he intends to effect major structural policy and even sociopolitical changes on both the domestic and foreign affairs fronts. I will leave it to others to discuss sociopolitical matters, as those are more peculiar to American societal interaction that many others are more familiar with.\nFEATURED STORIES\nOPINION\nUrgent action needed vs online piracy as Congress session nears end\nOPINION\nLife has shortened\nOPINION\nThe gift of second chances\nSuffice it for me to observe, at the risk of being simplistic, that he appears determined to restore \u201ctraditional values,\u201d and put the brakes on the forward march of progressive liberalism particularly its so called \u201cwoke\u201d fringe. Somewhat associated with these are two of his highest priorities: securing US borders from the recent surge of illegal migrants, and rebalancing (as he sees it) the country\u2019s energy sector development strategy from a rapid headlong plunge into renewable energy dependence, toward a somewhat more gradual transition to that goal by restoring fossil fuel exploration, or as he puts it, \u201cDrill baby, drill.\u201d\nOn the domestic economic front, his game plan appears aimed at restoring dynamic economic growth by tax cuts and reduced government regulation. This, he hopes, would energize the private sector and put more disposable income in the pockets of the middle and working class, entrepreneurs, and corporations, thus creating jobs and hopefully, a virtuous cycle of higher employment rates that would broaden the tax base and generate a more positive budget outcome to meet the pressing financing needs of, among others, modernizing the country\u2019s infrastructure.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThe downside to this strategy is that the effect of tax cuts has a lag time during which already serious fiscal deficits may grow, resulting in even greater temptation to print money that will end up fueling inflation and escalating the level of national debt that even now threatens to become unmanageable. This latter vicious cycle outcome Trump hopes to stem by serious cuts in expenditure.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nSuch cuts appear to depend mainly on a draconian review of \u201cwasteful government expenditures\u201d by the envisioned new Department of Government Efficiency led by Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy. This involves the surgical trimming of perceived bloated bureaucracy in such agencies as the departments of education and of defense, and defense expenditure itself. The US defense budget is 10 times that of the next 10 countries in the world combined as it maintains 750 military bases in 80 countries. Furthermore, an announced centerpiece of Trump\u2019s foreign policy is to proactively encourage negotiations toward peace on all major war fronts, if only to carry the record of having no wars during his tenure.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nHowever, the bellicose side of his foreign policy, namely tariff drumbeating designed, it seems, to restore a more vibrant manufacturing sector to the US economy, could be problematic. He may find that his tendency toward breast beating may have to be balanced by his equally adept sense of the \u201cart of the deal\u201d toward win-win solutions in a world where BRICS\u2014a forum for cooperation among a group of emerging economies including Brazil, Russia, China and the United Arab Emirates\u2014is a serious reality rather than a pushover. As well, the evolution from a unipolar to a multipolar world order appears to be gaining momentum so that moves to preserve US trade and military dominance may have to be tempered with a wiser strategy of revitalizing US competitiveness toward winning the hearts and minds of the world\u2019s citizenry.\nAssuming things go reasonably well toward the MAGA scenario, what\u2019s in it for the Philippines? At the very least, a US economy averting pneumonia will help stabilize the value of the peso and continue the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas\u2019 already optimistic scenario of progressively lowering interest rates. There are also signs that the US is more interested in an investment-oriented, rather than a China-containment, policy with us, such that Musk is reportedly eyeing the Philippines as a significant center for his expanded Asian business operations. Under these circumstances, President Marcos would be well advised to lead in calming turbulent local political waters, refocusing on the country\u2019s economic priorities and comparative advantages, and dusting off his father\u2019s battle cry, \u201cThis nation can be great again.\u201d\nArticle continues after this advertisement\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\nRoberto F.

More importantly, Thailand\u2019s globally recognized success is rooted in evidence-informed policies and programs that rely on research to answer critical issues on the best approach, effectivity, and possible improvements needed.\nThailand\u2019s commitment to using research to determine effective strategies, evaluate outcomes, and refine approaches for maximum impact is a key lesson. By focusing on root causes rather than symptoms, Thailand has shown the power of data-driven solutions.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nIn the Philippines, the UHC law has increased recognition of health promotion as a vital public health intervention. This is evident in expanded health promotion activities and investments at national and local levels guided by the Department of Health\u2019s Health Promotion Framework Strategy. However, challenges persist in the health promotion ecosystem, including limited resources, fragmented efforts, and weak integration with broader public policies.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThe Philippines can learn from Thailand\u2019s best practices in leveraging health promotion and disease prevention as foundational elements of UHC. Similar to Thailand, the DOH in collaboration with UP NIH, has established the Health Promotion Program to strengthen the generation of evidence.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nA key consideration for the future is fostering stronger collaboration among stakeholders to implement health-in-all policies. The Philippines can draw inspiration from ThaiHealth Foundation\u2019s role in guiding the government, the private sector, and communities toward health promotion goals driven by rigorous local evidence.\nHealth doesn\u2019t begin in a health clinic; it starts where people live, work, and play. While the tools are at our disposal, strong government and societal support are essential to turn them into action.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThailand\u2019s model offers valuable insights on integrating health promotion into the UHC framework and emphasizing evidence-based decision-making. By adapting these strategies to the local context, the Philippines can significantly advance toward UHC goals. It\u2019s time to prioritize health promotion as a core pillar of our health system, and not merely a supplementary strategy.\n(Disclaimer: The views expressed here are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the official policy or position of UP-NIH).\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\nYour subscription could not be saved.

        "content": "As the festive season approaches, with its accompanying flurry of shopping sprees and holiday gatherings, one expectation looms large: traffic. But the state of traffic in Metro Manila this Christmas season has spiraled into a condition that can only be described as chaotic and intolerable, a cruel joke played on the millions who call this congested urban expanse home.\nRecent statistics indicate an alarming reality, with over 480,000 vehicles clogging the 23.8 km long EDSA daily \u2014a staggering increase compared to regular traffic volumes. At first glance, one might argue that this rise is just an anticipated seasonal step-up; however, it highlights something much more sinister at play: the ever-deteriorating state of our transportation infrastructure and city planning.\nStretching across the metropolis, EDSA remains a prime arterial road, yet during peak hours, it is often like a parking lot. It\u2019s a scene mirrored by multiple other national roads across the city\u2014C5, Commonwealth Avenue, Quezon Avenue, Rizal Ave. Sucat Road, Magsaysay Boulevard, Roxas Boulevard, and beyond, all succumbing to the same fate. Even roads leading to ramps leading toalso congested&nbsp; Skyway are no exception.&nbsp; &nbsp;These routes become impassable, turning commutes that should take mere minutes into hours-long odysseys filled with frustration and despair for those simply trying to get home from work or to family gatherings.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThe Manila Metropolitan Development Authority (MMDA), the agency entrusted with maintaining order on these vital \u201cNational\u201d roadways, seems utterly helpless against the escalating congestion. Their traffic operations are increasingly ineffective, with an evident lack of urgent response to a systemic problem that escalates every day. The failings do not stop there; local government units (LGUs) demonstrate a similar limbo of incompetence when it comes to control of flows in their management of secondary and tertiary roads where alternate routes should exist. Instead, motorist frustration rises as these designated alternatives become just as crammed as main roads due to an obvious lack of coordination and traffic management.\nFEATURED STORIES\nOPINION\nUrgent action needed vs online piracy as Congress session nears end\nOPINION\nLife has shortened\nOPINION\nThe gift of second chances\nPerhaps the most appalling sight is observed post-5 PM. As the sun begins to set, the commitment of MMDA enforcers evaporates, leaving weary commuters to fend for themselves in navigating the madness alone. This is intolerable and indicates the ineffective deployment of their resources during peak periods. This inconsistency breeds frustration and undermines public trust in our traffic management authorities. For instance, having a strategy to deploy additional personnel during heavy shopping seasons or critical events\u2014like Christmas\u2014particularly during \u201cnighttime\u201d. should be a no-brainer. Is it a problem of compensation and lack of funding? &nbsp;Whatever, their &nbsp;failure to deploy and serve the people on the road only suggests that an organization such as MMDA is clearly unprepared to execute its basic mandate.\nEven the Philippine National Police\u2019s traffic policemen seem absent when collisions occur, slow to respond to disputes and significantly hampered in their efforts to clear bottlenecks.&nbsp;\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nAlso, we must pressure local government units to re-examine their traffic flow strategies. Is there effective synchronization of traffic lights? Are secondary roads being utilized properly to divert traffic where necessary? Their local CCTVs can assist in swift identification of jams and prompt law enforcement actions.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThis pervasive problem goes beyond just traffic\u2014it signals a substantial failure in governance and urban planning. What makes matters worse is the apparent disdain of our authorities, who repeatedly promised solutions but provide no visible improvements. This relentless decline in mobility exasperates already congested lives, showcasing a clear disconnect between public sentiment and the bureaucratic response to the growing crisis.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThe effect of this traffic nightmare cascades through society. People arrive late for work, school, and essential appointments. School children miss classes, businesses lose revenue due to delayed deliveries, and the psychological strain on citizens is palpable. It is not merely an inconvenience; it\u2019s a detrimental blight on the quality of life that residents should rightfully expect. This inefficiency robs productivity and negatively impacts mental health, further pushing the narrative that we are living in a city nonchalantly overseen by mismanagement and neglect.\nAs we march into another holiday season, sparked with joy and wonder, imagine our retail establishments overwhelmed as customers flock to secure gifts and gather provisions. Yet, instead of unfettered access, they are met with gridlock; shopping frenzy quickly turn into vehicular purgatory, mirroring the frustrations felt year after year.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nWhat exacerbates this situation further is the prevailing lack of long-term strategic plans from our leaders. Where are the innovative solutions to improve public transport?\nIt is high time that the Philippine government acknowledges this dire predicament and acts decisively to address it\u2014not just with temporary fixes, but with sustainable solutions that will redefine urban mobility in Metro Manila.\nUrgent measures must be implemented.

Velarde, chair of the Asian Institute of Journalism and Communication at Malaca\u00f1ang Palace on Friday. The \u201cmother of all Philippine maps\u201d has been cited as key evidence of the Philippine claims to the waters and other maritime features in the West Philippine Sea. \u2014Marianne Bermudez\nMANILA, Philippines \u2014 President Marcos could order the deployment of Philippine warships as a new policy option to respond to China\u2019s use of its own navy in its increasing aggression in the West Philippine Sea, but that decision is solely up to the Commander in Chief, a senior Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) officer said on Saturday.\nPCG spokesperson for the West Philippine Sea Commodore Jay Tarriela pointed out that the deployment of the People\u2019s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) ships \u201cwas now becoming part of the strategy of China in asserting their position in the West Philippine Sea,\u201d waters within the country\u2019s 370-kilometer exclusive economic zone (EEZ).\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nREAD:\nChina\u2019s PLA Navy shadows Philippine Coast Guard in West Philippine Sea\nFEATURED STORIES\nWWW\nLIVE UPDATES: Bar exam results 2024\nWWW\nTeodoro says petitions to cancel candidacy \u2018political maneuvering\u2019\nWWW\nLabor group seeks suspension of ballot printing for 2025 polls\nHe said that the deployment of Philippine warships \u201ccould be considered a reciprocal act\u201d since China was already doing it. Such a move is \u201cdependent on the Armed Forces of the Philippines on how they would like to come up with policy recommendation to strengthen our position in the West Philippine Sea,\u201d Tarriela said in a news forum.\n\u201cNow, if the question is if China is now deploying warships there, isn\u2019t it about time for us to deploy warships too?\u201d he asked.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\n\u201cI\u2019m not suggesting that we just deploy for the purpose of deploying warships,\u201d Tarriela said. \u201cWhat I said is it\u2019s up to the Commander in Chief and Armed Forces of the Philippines to come up with a policy recommendation to have the reciprocity of deployment.\u201d\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThe Philippines currently deploys \u201cwhite hulls,\u201d or coast guard vessels, not naval ships, for patrols and to perform law enforcement and other tasks in the West Philippine Sea to avoid militarizing the area.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThis policy has been in place since June 2012, when a Philippine Navy ship attempted to apprehend Chinese fishermen on eight vessels involved in digging up giant clams and corals and catching sharks illegally at Panatag (Scarborough) Shoal. They were blocked by other Chinese vessels until a two-month standoff eventually ended with China taking control of the atoll.\nThe Philippines maintains that is also adhering to the 2002 Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea between China and members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean), where they agreed not to escalate their maritime conflicts.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nChina lays sweeping claims to the South China Sea and has overlapping maritime claims with the Philippines, Vietnam, Brunei, and Malaysia.\nShadowing\n\u201cThe utilization of white ship in the West Philippine Sea is not something that President Marcos decided on his own. This has been our stand for the past three administrations already as a result of the 2012 standoff,\u201d Tarriela stressed.\nHis remarks followed the Dec. 4 shadowing of PCG vessels by Chinese PLAN near Panatag, also called Bajo de Masinloc. National Maritime Council spokesperson Alexander Lopez said it was the \u201cfirst time (they) came quite near and participated in the blocking or aggressive movements\u201d against PCG vessels.\nThe Chinese warship closely shadowed BRP Teresa Magbanua from a distance of only 270 meters while it attempted to approach a Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR) vessel.\nSideswiped\nAlso on the same day, a China Coast Guard (CCG) ship harassed the BRP Melchora Aquino, BRP Cape Enga\u00f1o, and the BFAR vessels that were deployed at Escoda (Sabina) Shoal. A CCG vessel with bow No. 3302 sideswiped BFAR\u2019s Datu Pagbuaya and fired its water cannon at it while it was conducting a routine patrol and delivering supplies to Filipino fishermen in the area.\nFormal protest\nThe Philippines filed a formal diplomatic protest against the Chinese actions.\nThe United States, the Philippines\u2019 treaty ally, and other countries also condemned China.\n\u201cThe PRC\u2019s (People\u2019s Republic of China) unlawful use of water cannons and dangerous maneuvers disrupted a Philippine maritime operation on December 4, putting lives at risk,\u201d American Ambassador MaryKay Carlson said in a statement on X.\n\u201cWe condemn these actions and stand with our like-minded friends, partners, and allies in support of a [Free and open Indo-Pacific],\u201d she said.\n\u2018No legal basis\u2019\nThe European Union, United Kingdom, Japan, France, Canada and Australia also expressed their concerns.\n\u201cWe oppose any threat of use of force contrary to international law and recall the importance of resolving disputes through dialogue. We recall the decision rendered by the Arbitral Court on July 12, 2016,\u201d the French Embassy in Manila said.\nThe 2016 arbitral award upheld Manila\u2019s sovereign rights to its EEZ in the western region, which includes Bajo de Masinloc, and rejected China\u2019s expansionist claim over the South China Sea for having \u201cno legal basis\u201d in international law.\nThe Chinese Embassy in Manila on Friday blasted the United States and its allies for expressing support to the Philippines, calling Carlson and the other countries \u201ctroublemakers to the peace and stability of the South China Sea.\u201d\n\u2018No right to interfere\u2019\n\u201cThe US Ambassador to the Philippines overlooked basic facts and made groundless accusations against China\u2019s legitimate measures for protecting its territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests.

The airline is confident that it will surpass the 3,609 passengers carried in first-class cabin in 2023.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThese affluent consumers\u2014a key growth driver for the airline\u2014often travel from Manila to Dubai while enjoying luxury suite in the sky.\nFEATURED STORIES\nBUSINESS\nMore foreign brands seen coming to PH shores in 2025\nBUSINESS\nGlobal Dominion: Simplifying financing to empower every Filipino\nBUSINESS\nInternational group kicks off infrastructure investment drive for PH\n\u201cWe\u2019ve noticed, especially after the pandemic, that premium travel demand is high in the Philippines. We saw that the product that\u2019s missing is the first-class product. So today, we offer our passengers seamless connectivity through a first-class suite out of Manila to the world,\u201d says Saeed Abdullah Miran, Emirates Philippines country manager.\nA recent checking of the Emirates online booking portal shows that a round trip first-class ticket from Manila to Dubai costs more than $5,000 aboard the Boeing 777 aircraft. Flying business-class in the same route costs around $3,200 while economy fare costs about $990.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nSHOP AND FLY The new Emirates retail hub in BGC is designed to serve as a one-stop shop where customers can explore Emirates products and services.\nVoted as the \u201cWorld\u2019s Best First Class\u201d in 2020 in a Tripadvisor survey, Emirates\u2019 Boeing 777 offers \u201ca private hotel room in the sky.\u201d First-class tickets include access to a premium airport lounge, fine dining service, an exclusive Bulgari amenity kit as well as soft-leather seating patterned after the interior of Mercedes Benz S-Class.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nIn addition, Miran adds that the largest international airline has seen \u201ca yearly positive growth\u201d for the Philippine market. Last year, Emirates exceeded the prepandemic passenger volume amid the growing demand for leisure travel.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nCrucial market\n\u201c[The Philippines] is one of our most important markets in the Far East region. We remain committed to this market [because] the demand here is huge,\u201d he says in an interview.\nAside from leisure travelers, the Dubai-based airline also caters to business travelers and overseas Filipino workers. From the Dubai hub, they can also get connecting flights to other destinations, especially Europe.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nRiding on the optimism of the resurgence of international travel, Emirates launched on Nov. 21 the Emirates World retail store at Shangri-La the Fort, the airline\u2019s first store in Southeast Asia and its fourth in the world, next to its retail spaces in Nairobi, London and Hong Kong.\n4TH IN THE WORLD Located at Shangri-La The Fort, Manila in BGC, the 221-square meter Emirates World store underscores the airline\u2019s commitment to the Philippines\nThe 221-square meter Philippine store introduces a fully immersive Emirates experience equipped with smart technology, featuring an interactive self-service screen that allows customers to quickly browse flight options, check availability and even take selfies against background of popular destinations operated by Emirates.\n\u201cThe new Emirates World Store in [Metro] Manila is designed to serve as a one-stop shop where customers can explore Emirates\u2019 best-in-class products and services and provides visitors a glimpse of our onboard hospitality and excellence,\u201d says Adnan Kazim, deputy president and chief commercial officer at Emirates.\nWhat makes the retail space in BGC different from its overseas counterparts? It has a customized A380 onboard lounge display, giving customers a first-hand look at the premium touches that define Emirates\u2019 world-class service.\nBased on their studies, Miran says that Filipino customers still prefer human interaction coupled with immersive technology when booking their flights.\nTOUCHSCREEN The store introduces a fully immersive Emirates experience equipped with smart technology, featuring an interactive self-service screen.\n\u201c[The retail store] in Hong Kong does not have a lounge or the in-flight bar (that is only available onboard the A380 aircraft). So you will find that in every shop, [there is] a different setup but the same basics,\u201d he explains.\nCommitted to PH\nWith an estimated investment of $25 million over the next three years, the airline plans to launch more experiential stores around its network as part of its retail strategy. The next shops will open in Casablanca, Bangkok and Singapore.\nIt was in 1990 when Emirates started to service the Manila route. Now, it serves the country with 28 weekly flights, offering around 22,700 weekly seats to and from Dubai. In 2016, the airline included a circular service to Cebu and Clark.\n\u201cOur presence in Philippines is very strong. We are one of the first airlines from the GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council) that operated here and we started operating 34 years ago, and we kept our commitment by enhancing our service, enhancing our product and enhancing our network,\u201d Miran adds.\nHAPPY HOUR A fully functional replica of the Emirates A380 in-flight bar at Emirates World Store \u2014PHOTOS BY VANESSA B.

Under the agreement, PAL\u2019s customers can also benefit from increased connectivity to nine international points via Dubai including Amman, Birmingham, Cape Town, Dammam, Dublin, Lisbon, Manchester, Muscat and Riyadh.\nIn the first half of 2024, Emirates increased scheduled flights to eight cities including Cebu, Clark, Manila, Amsterdam, Luanda, Lyon, Madrid and Singapore.\nAlso, Emirates has increased connectivity options from its Dubai International Airport hub and is now servicing 148 destinations worldwide.

The move exposed anyone in the community or connected to it to criminal prosecution and prison, ushering in an atmosphere of fear and intimidation.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\n\u201cI\u2019m scared for the queer community in Russia that remains in the country,\u201d Gogishvili told The Associated Press.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nLinking LGBTQ+ rights to the war in Ukraine\nThat community in Russia has been under legal and public pressure for over a decade but especially since the Kremlin sent troops to Ukraine in 2022.

Gender-affirming medical care and changing one\u2019s gender in official documents are prohibited. With the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in November 2023, anyone involved with the LGBTQ+ community could be imprisoned for up to six years.\nAs a result, many left the country. But others remain \u2013 and find themselves in a community pushed into the shadows, marginalized even further and dogged by fear of repression.\n\u201cSix years, it\u2019s not a joke,\u201d Olga Baranova, head of the Moscow Community Center for LGBT+ Initiatives, said in an interview from outside Russia. \u201c\u2019What is worth me going to prison for six years?\u2019 Every person who\u2019s doing something right now (in LGBTQ+ activism in Russia) has to answer this question these days.\u201d\nFILE PHOTO: A police officer detains a gay rights activist in Red Square in Moscow on Feb. 7, 2014. (Associated Press Photo/Evgeny Feldman, File)\nTargeting nightclubs, rainbow flags, and gay tourism\nJust days after the Supreme Court ruling, the LGBTQ+ community was rattled by news of police raiding gay bars, nightclubs and venues that hosted drag shows in Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities.\nLast spring, the first criminal case on charges of involvement with the \u201cLGBT movement\u201d extremist group was lodged against the owner and the staff of a bar in the southwestern city of Orenburg that held drag performances. A handful of similar cases came elsewhere.\nCharges have been launched for displaying symbols such as a rainbow flag \u2013 even though many of those accused had nothing to do with the LGBTQ+ community, said human rights lawyer Max Olenichev.\nMore raids of bars and nightclubs were reported in Moscow last month, almost exactly a year since the Supreme Court ruling. State media quoted law enforcement as saying they targeted those spreading \u201cLGBT propaganda.\u201d\nREAD:\nRussian LGBTQ+ museum closes after new law bans \u2018gay propaganda\u2019\nOne man arrested for allegedly running a travel agency for gay customers faces charges of organizing activities of an extremist organization. Independent news outlet Mediazona reported that Andrei Kotov rejected the charges and said in court that law enforcement officers beat him and administered electric shocks during the arrest, even though he didn\u2019t resist.\nOn Nov. 23, Putin signed into law a bill banning the adoption of Russian children by citizens of countries where gender-affirming care is legal. He also approved legislation outlawing the spread of material that encourages people not to have children.\n\u201cAll this, in general, speaks more about the desire of the authorities to create some kind of atmosphere of fear. It\u2019s not repressions, it\u2019s terror,\u201d said Vladimir, an LGBTQ+ rights advocate in Russia who like many interviewed by AP asked to be identified only by a first name out of security concerns.\nIkar, a fellow activist and transgender man, described the actions by authorities as \u201can attempt to intimidate \u2026 to make people lose their social connections, stay silent, stay home.\u201d\nGoing underground, online or abroad\nVladimir and Ikar belong to an underground LGBTQ+ rights group that offers legal aid and holds offline events without fanfare. Activists thoroughly verify identities of anyone seeking its help.\nThe group is seeing a growing number of cases related to violence against LGBTQ+ people, Vladimir said.\nSome regional organizations have shut down completely; others operate openly, but in a drastically different way. The Moscow Community Center for LGBT+ Initiatives moved its community-building efforts into a sprawling online network of chats and Zoom meeting rooms, according to Baranova.\n\u201cOur strategy today is to preserve the community in some form and size at least, for the people to just know each other, support each other,\u201d she said.\nCenter T, a prominent trans rights group, closed its Moscow shelter after visits from police and opened one in Yerevan, Armenia, said group leader Yan Dvorkin. Center T helps emigres as well as those still in Russia to find doctors and medical care, trying to resolve crises and still be a part of a community, if only online.\nAnna, a 25-year-old transgender woman in Moscow, said being part of the community provided the courage to transition. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine what it\u2019s like for new people, who are only opening up the possibility for themselves,\u201d she said.\nAnna transitioned and came out to her family and friends last year, after the ban on gender-affirming care was enacted.\nFILE PHOTO: Gay rights activists hold a banner reading \u201cHomophobia \u2013 the religion of bullies\u201d during a protest on Red Square in Moscow on July 14, 2013. (Associated Press Photo/Evgeny Feldman, File)\nThe ban and other repressive laws and rulings hit the already-vulnerable transgender community hard, Dvorkin said.\nFinding a job has become more difficult, both for those who haven\u2019t changed their gender marker in documents and those who have, he said. Access to gender-affirming medical care is a major issue, with doctors wary of working with transgender people and with many turning to shoddy underground medications.\nViolence against transgender people has spiked, as has harassment and discrimination, Dvorkin said.\n\u201cNowadays, you can intimidate people \u2013 blackmail them \u2013 by (saying) that \u2018I will report you and you will go to prison for extremism,\u2019\u201d the activist said.\nThose who stay in Russia, despite the risks\nAnna considers herself lucky and \u201cprivileged.\u201d She has a well-paying job, can afford a doctor advising her from abroad on hormonal therapy, and can get the medicine in Moscow. She wouldn\u2019t elaborate on how and where she gets it, so authorities \u201cdon\u2019t pull the plug.\u201d\nBut she said she hasn\u2019t come out to her colleagues for fear of losing her job, and she is sometimes harassed on the street because of her appearance. Her identity documents can\u2019t be changed under the ban.\nShe says she has a support network of friends and doesn\u2019t want to leave Russia, even though she\u2019s acutely aware of the risks.\n\u201cI somehow have managed to adapt,\u201d she said. \u201cI know how to live here.\u201d\nYulia, another transgender woman, also vowed to stay, describing it as sort of a mission to show that \u201cpeople like me are not necessarily weak, are not necessarily useless.\u201d\nIn her mid-40s, Yulia has a family and children, a successful career in a male-dominated industry, and the respect and acceptance from her colleagues and friends. For her, \u201cit\u2019s about normalizing\u201d being trans, she said.\nHow much \u201cnormalizing\u201d is possible in the current climate and the years ahead is still an open question.\nThe\nban on \u201cpropaganda of nontraditional sexual relations\u201d\nforces print, TV, and movie censorship of LGBTQ+ relations.

Associated Press\nCAPE TOWN, South Africa \u2014 President Joe Biden is finally making his long-promised visit to Africa this week, attempting to showcase a U.S.-backed railway project in three countries that he has pushed as a new approach in countering some of China\u2019s global influence.\nBiden\u2019s first visit to the continent as president \u2014 which he left to the very end \u2014 will highlight the Lobito Corridor railway redevelopment in Zambia, Congo and Angola. It aims to advance U.S. presence in a region rich in the critical minerals used in batteries for electric vehicles, electronic devices and clean energy technologies.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThat\u2019s a key field for U.S.-China competition and China has a stranglehold on Africa\u2019s critical minerals.\nFEATURED STORIES\nGLOBALNATION\nPCG: China using AIS spoofing to mislead public and stir confusion\nGLOBALNATION\nPH asserts rights over Bajo de Masinloc at UN General Assembly\nGLOBALNATION\n'Aid for Kristine-hit Batangas': Presidential assistance for farmers, fisherfolk, families\nA new strategy\nThe U.S. has for years built relations in Africa through trade, security and humanitarian aid.

The trip was kicked back to 2024 and delayed again this October because of Hurricane Milton, reinforcing a sentiment among Africans that their continent is still low priority. The last U.S. president to visit was Barack Obama in 2015.\n\u201cAfrica never gets top attention,\u201d said Witney Schniedman, an expert on African economic growth at the nonprofit Brookings Institution.\nBut many are optimistic that the Lobito project, which isn\u2019t due for completion until well after Biden has left office, will survive a change of administration and be given a chance. It goes some way to blunting China, which has bipartisan backing and is high on Trump\u2019s to-do list.\n\u201cAs long as they keep labeling Lobito one of the main anti-China tools in Africa, there is a certain likelihood that it\u2019s going to keep being funded,\u201d said Christian-G\u00e9raud Neema, who analyzes China-Africa relations.\nSome success in Africa\nThe Lobito Corridor will be an upgrade and extension of a railway line from the copper and cobalt mines of northern Zambia and southern Congo to Angola\u2019s Atlantic Ocean port of Lobito, a route west for Africa\u2019s critical minerals.\nIt\u2019s little more than a starting point for the U.S. and its partners, because China is dominant in the mining in Zambia and Congo. Congo has more than 70% of the world\u2019s cobalt, most of which is heading to China to reinforce its critical mineral supply chain that the U.S. and Europe have to rely on.\nLobito was made possible by some American diplomatic success in Angola that led to a Western consortium winning the bid for the project in 2022 ahead of Chinese competition, a surprise given Angola\u2019s long and strong ties with Beijing. China financed a previous redevelopment of the railway.\nThe Biden administration accelerated American outreach to Angola, turning around what was an antagonistic relationship three decades ago when the U.S. armed anti-government rebels in Angola\u2019s civil war. U.S.-Angola trade was $1.77 billion last year, while the U.S. has a stronger stake in regional security through a strategic presence on the Atlantic Ocean, and Angolan President Jo\u00e3o Louren\u00e7o\u2019s role mediating in a conflict in eastern Congo.\nIn Angola, Biden will announce new developments on health, agribusiness, security cooperation as well as the Lobito Corridor, White House officials said on a preview call with reporters.\nThe visit, the first by a sitting U.S. president to Angola, will \u201chighlight that remarkable evolution of the U.S.-Angola relationship,\u201d Frances Brown, a special assistant to the president and senior director for African affairs at the National Security Council, said on a separate call.\nIt will also draw attention to a perennial challenge for America\u2019s value-based diplomacy in Africa. International rights groups have used Biden\u2019s trip to criticize the Louren\u00e7o government\u2019s authoritarian shift. Political opponents have been imprisoned and allegedly tortured, while security and other laws have been passed in Angola that severely restrict freedoms, throwing some scrutiny on Washington\u2019s new African partnership.\nWill the US really show up?\nThose calling for more U.S. presence in Africa say Angola and the Lobito spinoff show what might be achieved, even with China-facing countries, if the U.S. is willing to consistently engage. But they see signs for Africa when China has held a summit with African leaders every three years since 2000, while the US has had just two summits, in 2014 and 2022, and there are no plans for the next one.\nMichelle Gavin, a former U.S. ambassador to Botswana and adviser on Africa to Obama, said that the U.S. had failed to take Africa seriously over multiple administrations, a bipartisan trend. She doesn\u2019t see Biden\u2019s visit and Lobito being a major \u201cinflection point\u201d that will drive a new U.S. focus across Africa.\nYour subscription could not be saved.

        "content": "ILLUSTRATION BY RUTH MACAPAGAL\nBesides being the founder and global group chair of my worldwide strategy and management consulting company, I have also been a graduate executive MBA professor for more than 13 years. I know that many of the most important keys to success are not taught at business school. One of them is how to create a great network.\nGrowing up in a small town in Germany, my family didn\u2019t have much. We weren\u2019t wealthy, and money was a constant concern. I wasn\u2019t born with a silver spoon or a vast network. Instead, I built my global network from scratch. Now I am regularly interacting with or advising heads of state, Nobel laureates, Fortune 500 CEOs, some of the world\u2019s wealthiest business owners and many of the world\u2019s most famous business leaders. How did I pull that off? My journey taught me that\u2014besides expertise and unique skills\u2014reputation and trust are the most important.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThe foundation of success: Reputation and trust\nAll of the clients of my global strategy and management consulting company go through a due diligence process and background checks before we take them on. We are in the fortunate position that we can choose who to work with and regularly turn requests away.\nFEATURED STORIES\nBUSINESS\nMore foreign brands seen coming to PH shores in 2025\nBUSINESS\nGlobal Dominion: Simplifying financing to empower every Filipino\nBUSINESS\nInternational group kicks off infrastructure investment drive for PH\nRecently, we discovered that one of our new prospects, a family business owner, despite maintaining a good public reputation, has questionable ethical standards. This individual has a pattern of engaging in unethical practices whenever he believes he can get away with it, disregarding clear agreements.\nIn business, your reputation is your most valuable asset. It precedes you in every room, opening doors that would otherwise remain closed. Trust is the currency of this reputation. It\u2019s what turns introductions into partnerships and handshake deals into long-term relationships.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nA handshake should carry the same weight as a signed contract, and a verbal agreement should be as binding as one certified by lawyers. For instance, a family business we work with, which has thrived for 55 years and serves hundreds of millions of consumers worldwide, entrusts us with its most confidential financial details without even requiring a nondisclosure agreement. This level of trust demonstrates that reputation and integrity form the backbone of business relationships.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nEthics as a competitive edge\nEthical behavior in business is often viewed as a moral responsibility, but its practical benefits cannot be overstated. High ethical standards are not just about adhering to laws or regulations; they serve as a unique competitive edge in the marketplace. Companies and leaders known for their integrity attract top-tier talent, loyal customers and trustworthy business partners. These stakeholders are more likely to invest their time, energy and resources in organizations they perceive as ethical and dependable.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nA strong commitment to ethics creates a culture of accountability and transparency within the organization. Employees feel safe and empowered when they work for a leader who values honesty over shortcuts. This sense of trust fosters innovation, collaboration and long-term employee retention. For example, one of our long-standing clients\u2014a multigenerational family business\u2014has continuously expanded into new markets while maintaining an impeccable reputation for ethical dealings. This reputation has not only attracted lucrative partnerships but also positioned the business as a trusted leader in its industry, ensuring its sustainability over decades.\nMoreover, ethical behavior often translates into better decision-making. Leaders who prioritize long-term relationships and sustainable growth over immediate profits avoid the pitfalls of hasty, ill-conceived decisions. They cultivate trust within their ecosystems, which acts as a buffer in times of crisis. Ethical businesses are less likely to face reputational damage or costly legal battles, giving them a competitive advantage over peers who choose to cut corners.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nLessons from the fallen\nHistory is littered with examples of leaders and companies brought to their knees by unethical behavior. These cautionary tales highlight that success achieved through dishonesty is rarely sustainable and that the costs of unethical decisions often far outweigh their short-term benefits.\nConsider the downfall of Enron, a company once hailed as one of America\u2019s most innovative enterprises. Its executives engaged in fraudulent accounting practices, inflating profits to maintain investor confidence. When the truth emerged, Enron filed for bankruptcy, erasing thousands of jobs and wiping out billions in shareholder value.\nAnother example is the Volkswagen emissions scandal. The company deliberately installed software in millions of cars to cheat emissions tests, allowing it to market vehicles as environmentally friendly when they were anything but. The scandal cost Volkswagen billions in fines, lawsuits and vehicle recalls, and it severely damaged brand reputation. Rebuilding that trust has been a long and arduous journey for Volkswagen, underscoring the heavy price of unethical shortcuts.\nThese cases demonstrate that the ripple effects of unethical decisions extend far beyond financial loss. They destroy careers, tarnish reputations and leave organizations struggling to regain public trust. For leaders, the takeaway is clear: shortcuts in ethics may provide temporary gains, but they often lead to irreversible damage.\nThe fragility of success\nSuccess in business is fragile. Most companies are only one or two major strategic decisions away from total failure. A lapse in ethical judgment can be one such misstep, with far-reaching consequences. It\u2019s crucial to maintain high ethical standards, even when faced with challenging decisions.\nLeaders who cut corners or bend the rules often rationalize their actions by assuming no one will notice. However, word spreads quickly in the business community. When trust is eroded, opportunities disappear, and partnerships dissolve. Worse, leaders who operate unethically may not realize the damage until it\u2019s too late, as few are willing to confront them directly.\nThe ripple effect of leadership\nUnethical behavior at the top doesn\u2019t stay contained; it trickles down through the organization. As the leader, your actions set the tone for your company culture. If you compromise on ethics, it sends a message that dishonesty and cutting corners are acceptable. This behavior can lead to a toxic environment where employees feel justified in bending the rules.\nOn the flip side, leaders who uphold integrity inspire their teams to do the same. Ethical leadership fosters a culture of accountability, transparency and mutual respect, which in turn drives innovation and growth.\nFive to thrive\n\u2022 Prioritize integrity in\nevery decision\n\u2022 Cultivate a culture of trust\n\u2022 Invest in long-term relationships\n\u2022 Learn from failures in ethics\n\u2022 Implement ethical accountability systems INQ\nYour subscription could not be saved.

(Photo from Jiji Press)\nAn increasing number of Japanese companies operating in China are transferring their production bases to countries in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean).\nThis comes as Chinese economic growth slows and concerns rise over the risks of doing business in China, where foreign residents have been arrested on vague grounds.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThe Chinese economy is stagnating, and this can clearly be seen in production, consumption and investments. The country\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) for the second quarter (April-June) of 2024 grew 4.7% year over year, which was 0.6 points lower than the first quarter (January-March). Economic data from August shows that retail business sales, an indicator of consumption trends, grew only 2.1% year over year.\nFEATURED STORIES\nBUSINESS\nMore foreign brands seen coming to PH shores in 2025\nBUSINESS\nGlobal Dominion: Simplifying financing to empower every Filipino\nBUSINESS\nInternational group kicks off infrastructure investment drive for PH\nREAD:\nPH, US, Japan agree vs \u2018economic coercion\u2019\nThe slump in the real estate industry is a major factor behind this. The real estate market and related industries make up a fourth of China\u2019s GDP, but investments in real estate development fell 10.2% year over year in the period between January and August 2024.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, China implemented a \u201cZero-COVID Strategy,\u201d which kept citizens indoors, dealt a major blow to the tourism and restaurant industries, and led to investments being concentrated in real estate. Home prices rose exponentially.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nIn response, the Chinese government placed heavy restrictions on risky deals. This caused home prices to drop drastically, and the businesses of many major real estate developers declined. Down payments were made, but buildings never got built, and as similar cases followed one after another, the consumption trend cooled among the population.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nFurthermore, the Chinese government, which places utmost importance on national security, established the Counter Espionage Law in 2014. This has resulted in many foreigners, including Japanese, being arrested for \u201cespionage acts,\u201d which are only vaguely defined.\nStarting in July 2024, new regulations have been implemented that allow authorities to inspect the contents of electronic devices of individuals and organizations for acts of espionage, raising further concerns that even regular economic activities could be scrutinized. With little hope for significant growth in the Chinese market, coupled with the risks of doing business in China, direct international investments into the country fell 29.1% year over year between January and June 2024. There are also other issues, such as the risk of high tariffs on products produced in China and exported to the USA due to the ongoing tension between the two countries, as well as rising labor costs in China.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nAgainst this backdrop, Japanese companies are turning their eyes to Southeast Asia for new bases of production. In January 2023, Sony transferred the manufacturing of its cameras for Japan, Europe and the USA from China to Thailand. Its factories in China now only make products to be sold domestically, allowing it to reduce dependency on the country.\nKyocera also plans to transfer a part of its electric tool production in China to Vietnam in fiscal 2024. The Vietnam site will mainly manufacture products to be sold in the USA to avoid the tariffs placed on exports from China.\nAccording to Teikoku Databank, the number of Japanese companies operating in China decreased from 14,394 in 2012 to 13,034 in 2023. Many companies are choosing to relocate back to Japan or Southeast Asia. This can be seen in how Southeast Asian countries now occupy three of the top five locations in terms of the number of Japanese companies\u2019 overseas subsidiaries: No. 1 is China, followed by USA, Thailand, Singapore, and Vietnam.\nREAD:\nMore Asean nations offer help on South China Sea issue\nSoutheast Asia is attractive in many ways for Japanese companies. Not only is it geographically close to Japan but it also offers a rich pool of human resources with technical prowess and fluency in many languages including English, which allows companies to secure a stable labor force. Many Asean countries also have highly transparent fiscal policies and stable currency exchange rates. Cities have established solid infrastructure such as electrical power and transportation networks, making it easier for companies to build factories there and secure supply chains, from production and distribution to sales.\nThe Southeast Asian market is very appealing. The 10 Asean countries have a combined population of around 670 million people. It tops the population of the European Union (EU), which is around 450 million people and is the third largest in the world after India and China. The median age is also young, and unlike many developed nations, the region has not yet been faced with the issue of an aging society with a low birthrate.\nThe 2023 nominal GDP of the 10 Asean countries combined rose to around 3.81 trillion US dollars, which ranks right after the USA, China, Germany and Japan. It is forecast to overtake Japan\u2019s GDP by 2030. Due to the effects of an aging population and low birthrate, there are concerns that Japan\u2019s market and labor force will shrink going forward. Japanese companies will benefit greatly from operating and expanding their businesses in Southeast Asia, which has a large market, offers rich human resources and is referred to as \u201cthe world\u2019s growth center.\u201d\nForeign ministers of Asean, Japan, China and South Korea. (Photo by Jiji Press)\nJapan and Asean countries have established various cooperative partnerships in politics, foreign policy and the economy. Japan is an active participant in numerous Asean foreign policy and security frameworks, including the East Asia Summit (EAS), which started in Malaysia in 2005, Asean Regional Forum (ARF), which discusses political and security issues, and Asean Defense Ministers\u2019 Meeting Plus (ADMM-Plus), the only formal meeting of defense ministers in the Asia-Pacific region. In 2020, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) was officially signed, including Japan, China, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand in addition to Asean. Building an open economic sphere by providing market access and establishing economic rules is accelerating active free trade, including small and medium-sized businesses.\nWhile Southeast Asia is attractive to Japan, Japan must also be attractive to Southeast Asia. Southeast Asian company managers often say that decision-making is slow in Japanese businesses. They say this is due to a uniquely Japanese custom where multiple meetings are needed to make a single decision, and everyone has to then wait for it to be approved by the head office in Japan. Furthermore, Southeast Asians who grew up loving Japanese brands and anime are already in their 40s and 50s, while the attention of the younger generation, which is driving consumption, has been turning to South Korean and Chinese cultures as well. As such, greater efforts must be made to ensure that Southeast Asia will choose Japan as a partner.\nLast year, Japan and Asean celebrated their 50th anniversary of cooperative partnerships. The relationship, in fact, began as one of animosity. Japan drew the ire of Southeast Asia by exporting massive quantities of cheap synthetic rubber to Asean, a producer of natural rubber, and that led to the holding of the Asean-Japan forum on synthetic rubber in 1973.\nYour subscription could not be saved.

        "content": "Illustration by Ruth Macapagal`\nToday the old adage \u201cchange is the only constant\u201d has never rung truer. As the founder of a global strategy and management consulting firm, I recently encountered a financial services giant that starkly illustrated a critical pitfall facing large organizations today\u2014the peril of bureaucratic rigidity.\nWhen my team and I engaged with this behemoth, we were met with an organization so entrenched in its ways, so beholden to outdated processes, that it was clear they were on a trajectory toward obsolescence. Despite their size, their inability to adapt swiftly to market changes made us question whether our efforts could truly effect the necessary transformation.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThis encounter is not unique. Many large organizations fall into the trap of becoming slaves to their own processes. What starts as a framework to ensure efficiency and consistency morphs into a monolithic barrier to innovation and agility. This rigidity can be fatal, particularly in an era where flexibility and speed often trump sheer scale.\nFEATURED STORIES\nBUSINESS\nMore foreign brands seen coming to PH shores in 2025\nBUSINESS\nGlobal Dominion: Simplifying financing to empower every Filipino\nBUSINESS\nInternational group kicks off infrastructure investment drive for PH\nThe hidden cost of bureaucracy\nHistorically, we\u2019ve seen giants topple due to their inability to adapt. Kodak, for example, clung to traditional film while the world embraced digital photography. Similarly, Blockbuster failed to pivot in the face of streaming technology, allowing Netflix to revolutionize home entertainment.\nThe crux of the issue lies in a fundamental shift in the business environment. Economies of scale, once a significant advantage, are no longer the primary determinant of success. Today\u2019s winners are those who can pivot quickly, innovate constantly and remain agile in the face of change. Companies like Amazon, with its \u201cDay One\u201d mentality, exemplify this approach, constantly reinventing themselves to stay ahead.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThe cultural element of innovation vs. bureaucracy\nOne major advantage of my company being global is the diverse perspective we bring to each client. My team and I blend a broad, global outlook with an intimate understanding of local cultures. This unique combination allows us to frame problems and challenges within a proper global context, crafting solutions that elevate our clients to the next level with ease and speed.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nDifferent cultures around the world naturally foster either an innovation mindset or a bureaucratic one. The United States, for example, is renowned for its pragmatic, entrepreneurial approach, contributing to Silicon Valley\u2019s status as a global innovation hub. This region marries Californian playfulness with a business mindset, creating a fertile ground for tech giants.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nIn contrast, countries like Germany, Switzerland and some Southeast Asian nations such as the Philippines, lean towards bureaucratic tendencies, making it challenging for larger organizations to embrace agility.\nThe Middle East, though evolving with innovation hubs like Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Saudi Arabia, generally remains rooted in traditional corporate structures. However, these countries are now prioritizing innovation, with Oman serving as a contrasting example where traditional mindsets still contribute to bureaucratic tendencies.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nOur global insight, coupled with local expertise, empowers us to navigate these cultural nuances. We understand how an innovation-friendly environment can be a game-changer for our clients. By recognizing and adapting to these cultural differences, we can devise strategies that foster innovation and agility, propelling our clients toward success in a complex, interconnected world.\nExamples of successful turnarounds\nMy team and I have turned many slow dinosaurs into agile jaguars. If you know how, it is definitely possible. Companies can successfully rejuvenate themselves by embracing a startup mentality.\nThe global business landscape is full of many successful examples. For instance, Microsoft underwent a cultural shift under Satya Nadella\u2019s leadership, breaking down silos and fostering a more collaborative, innovative environment. Similarly, Ford revitalized its culture by focusing on transparency and lean decision-making, transforming from a legacy automaker into a more agile company.\nMy team and I have seen that even the most established organizations can avoid the pitfalls of bureaucracy with the right leadership and strategy. The key lies in fostering a culture that values speed, collaboration, and continuous innovation.\nA case study: Bureaucracy in action\nWe once had a client, a successful billionaire business owner, who envisioned a groundbreaking deal poised to catapult his company to new heights. However, as the proposal moved through various departments, the layers of bureaucracy began to distort the original vision. Each department added its own requirements and procedures, creating a complex web of red tape that deviated from the owner\u2019s intent. The deal, once promising, was on the brink of collapse due to this bureaucratic quagmire.\nIf you suspect that your company has fallen prey to the silent killer of bureaucracy, it\u2019s crucial to take decisive action. Begin by conducting a thorough audit of your processes to identify bottlenecks and redundancies. Encourage open communication across departments to ensure alignment with the company\u2019s core objectives. Empower employees to challenge inefficient practices and propose innovative solutions.\n\u200b\u200bSimilarly, Nokia offers another cautionary tale. Once a leader in mobile phones, Nokia failed to adapt quickly to the smartphone revolution, clinging to outdated systems and processes. This bureaucratic inertia allowed competitors like Apple and Samsung to overtake Nokia, which struggled to regain relevance.\nYour \u2018Five to Thrive\u2019\nIn the modern business environment, agility, not size, determines success. Bureaucracy can be a silent assassin, stifling the very dynamism that fuels growth. By prioritizing flexibility, empowering employees, and embracing innovation, business leaders can ensure their organizations not only survive but thrive in the long term.\nYour subscription could not be saved.

Here are five practical steps:\nPrioritize flexibility over rigidity. Foster a culture that values adaptability. Encourage employees at all levels to challenge the status quo and propose improvements.\nStreamline processes. Regularly review and refine workflows to eliminate redundancies. Keep structures lean to maintain agility.\nEmpower decision-making. Decentralize authority to enable faster responses. Train teams to make informed decisions without excessive oversight.\nEncourage innovation. Advocate for a fail-fast approach, where experimentation is rewarded, and learning from failures is part of the process. Encourage cross-functional collaboration to spark creative solutions.\nLeverage technology. Embrace new technologies to streamline operations and gain a competitive edge.

        "content": "SEOUL\u2014As Israel proceeds with a ground offensive against Hezbollah, the situation in the Middle East continues to deteriorate, with the prospects for ending the war dim, and the number of lives lost escalating. Absent this time is US intervention to manage the crisis. Has the international order led by the United States since the end of the Cold War collapsed?\nMost analyses, including that of New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman, have pierced the essence of the current Middle East conflict as a struggle between the \u201ccoalition of inclusion\u201d and the \u201ccoalition of resistance.\u201d But they overlook one crucial element: the importance of domestic politics.\nIn Israel, this centers on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who faces responsibility for failing to prevent last year\u2019s surprise attack by Hamas. Over 41,615 Palestinians, mostly civilians, have died in Gaza due to Israeli military actions, adding to his burden. Israel, once seen as a victim of the Holocaust, is now increasingly viewed as a perpetrator of war crimes.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nNetanyahu also faces legal issues related to corruption charges. Given these circumstances, he may feel the need to secure an image of overwhelming victory to push for an end to the war. Otherwise, a conclusion to the war could signal the beginning of him being found legally or politically accountable. Thus, it\u2019s natural to suspect that Israel\u2019s provocative military actions against Hamas, Iran and Hezbollah may be driven more by Netanyahu\u2019s personal political interests than by the broader struggle between the teams of \u201cinclusion\u201d and \u201cresistance.\u201d\nFEATURED STORIES\nOPINION\nUrgent action needed vs online piracy as Congress session nears end\nOPINION\nLife has shortened\nOPINION\nThe gift of second chances\nIran\u2019s domestic politics show a different picture. Its missile attack toward Israel on Tuesday might be interpreted as a skillfully compromised operation. The attack comes belatedly as retaliation for the death of Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah, killed on Sept. 27, and of Ismail Haniyeh, the Hamas leader assassinated on July 31. The strike was more a show of force rather than angling for real damages because Iran is aware that most of the missiles would be intercepted by Israel\u2019s Iron Dome.\nIran\u2019s halfway response implies that Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, who is representing the reformists, has a voice in the decision-making process, and is trying to avoid a full-scale war with Israel and improve relations with the US.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nDomestic politics in the US also contribute to the situation in the Middle East, with the US\u2019 inability to act possibly influenced by the strong pro-Israel lobby within the country. However, the national security guidelines of its Indo-Pacific strategy might also be a significant factor. While this strategy aligns with the general American public\u2019s displeasure with China, it has led to a perception that issues in other areas are of secondary importance. As a result, misunderstandings about the US\u2019 global role have spread, leading to neglect in dealing with other regions.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThis neglect has erupted in various crises, such as Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and Israel\u2019s continued military operations. The Indo-Pacific strategy, which harms US hegemony and reputation, was a product of domestic political focus. After winning in 2016, then President Donald Trump boosted his popularity by noting that contradictions in the US economy and society stem from cheap Chinese products and illegal immigrants. As a result, China-bashing became a political trend no US politician could resist. Even the Biden administration had to adopt a foreign policy focused on checking China to survive in the domestic political arena.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nBy reconstructing the Middle East situation through the lens of domestic politics in the US, Israel and Iran, one can derive a somewhat different picture from Friedman\u2019s grand narrative that the clash between the \u201ccoalition of inclusion\u201d and \u201ccoalition of resistance\u201d is inevitable. The cohesion within both camps is weak, and painting Iran, Iraq, or Hezbollah as villains does not help, nor is it necessary to argue that eliminating them would connect the Asia-Pacific and Europe.\nWhile understanding the rivalry between Friedman\u2019s coalitions of inclusion and resistance is important for comprehending and resolving the Middle East crisis, it is equally critical to account for the changes, if not distortions, caused by domestic politics. This perspective allows us to urge the US to adopt and implement a global-scale strategy focusing on universal values and norms, rather than a China-centered regional response like the Indo-Pacific strategy. Additionally, it is essential to pressure Netanyahu to abandon his reckless war initiatives and instead champion strategies for peace and coexistence in Israel and the wider Middle East.&nbsp;\n\u2014The Korea Herald/Asia News Network\nArticle continues after this advertisement\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nThe Philippine Daily Inquirer is a member of the Asia News Network, an alliance of 22 media titles in the region.\nYour subscription could not be saved.

There\u2019s too much wine, and people are drinking less.\u201d\nWhen we met with Wine Drop\u2019s managing director Jean-Philippe Guillot, he dropped this sobering yet unfortunately long-standing fact. There has been a downward trend in wine consumption globally since 2018, and the most recent estimate by the\nInternational Organization of Vine and Wine\nnoted that 2023 consumption was the lowest volume they\u2019ve recorded since 1996.\nDespite the decreased\ndemand\nin European and Western wine-drinking countries (and even China), it\u2019s surprising to see that the wine market is actually growing in the Philippines.\nIn 2022, the country was noted to be one of the \u201cmost exciting wine markets,\u201d thanks to the continued increase in wine consumption here. However, there\u2019s still much work to be done.\nFor wine distributors like AWC, of which Wine Drop is under, tickling Filipinos\u2019 taste buds for wine is proving to be a reliable strategy.&nbsp;\nWine Drop is AWC\u2019s retail component, providing spaces for consumers to directly purchase, drink, and even learn more about the wines they carry.&nbsp;\nSince 2014, AWC has been known for supplying quality wine to some of the country\u2019s top hotels, resorts, and restaurants, such as the Shangri-la group, Grand Hyatt, Fairmont, Raffles, Dusit Thani as well as Solaire and Okada.\n\u201cWine was not really in the culture of the Philippines, so a lot of restaurants didn\u2019t really have a wine list. A lot of Filipinos are also traveling the world, and of course they get into wine more. So our first mission was really to bring good quality wine from around the globe and help restaurants\nbuild their wine list\n,\u201d Guillot says.\nBut after years of showcasing their wines at partner restaurants and online resellers, the group realized the need for a platform or space where customers could buy bottles directly. \u201cIt was a bit frustrating that there\u2019s no shop to showcase our wine for people. If they enjoyed [the] wine in a restaurant, they don\u2019t really know where to buy it for their home. So that was our first motivation, to have a place where people can find all the wine.\u201d\nThe pandemic also played a major role in AWC\u2019s decision to establish Wine Drop. \u201cBecause most of our customers were hotels and restaurants and they were all closed during COVID, we had a lot of stock of wine,\u201d Guillot says. Thus their website winedrop.life was created.\nSoon after, Wine Drop ventured into putting up a physical space in Greenhills. Guillot describes the neighborhood as one that is \u201cdynamic\u2026 with people who love F&amp;B.\u201d\nAfter a year in Greenhills, Wine Drop ventured into a second location, this time in Makati, along the strip of warehouses at Chino Roces Extension. The decision to open here came with two-fold benefits: As primarily a wine importer, having both a shop and a warehouse space was crucial. The warehouse, which they keep cold at a controlled temperature of 16 to 17 degrees every day, ensures that the wine they carry will maintain its quality.\n\u201cWine is a product that\u2019s still alive,\u201d Guillot says. \u201cIf you don\u2019t take care of it, it will turn into vinegar. That\u2019s not what it\u2019s supposed to be.\u201d\nFilipinos and wine\nWhile the Philippines is still not a major wine market, it is showing great promise especially in recent years. Guillot attributes this to the rapidly changing F&amp;B landscape in the country.\n\u201cFilipinos usually eat and then drink after. In France, you eat and drink at the same time. It\u2019s two different cultures. But when you look at these new fantastic restaurants opening with a new chef generation, when you look at all these new\nsommeliers\nor bartenders who have worked abroad and are coming back to the Philippines, they bring what they learned abroad. That\u2019s what makes Manila unique, I think, and very impressive in terms of new concepts,\u201d Guillot says.\n\u201cThis new generation of Filipinos are so passionate about wine,\u201d he says. \u201cI know a lot of them, and their passion is wine, to taste wine. I think you have this big dynamic market where people enjoy going out and drinking good stuff as well.\u201d\nJean-Philippe Guillot\nAmong the wines that has been in Wine Drop\u2019s rotation the longest is this wine from Chateau Cap de Fer.\nWith this growing interest in wine, Wine Drop\u2019s mission is to further cultivate that interest.&nbsp;\n\u201cWine could sound intimidating for some people. Not everyone\u2019s going to go to a five-star hotel [to drink wine], and when you open the wine list, it\u2019s very hard to choose,\u201d Guillot says. \u201cAt Wine Drop, we wanted to have a nice place that\u2019s engaging and easy to come in. The idea of Wine Drop is really to make a wine shop that is accessible.\u201d\nAt the Makati shop, the wines are classified by taste profile, instead of price or country of origin. Their featured wines come in a wide range of prices, the cheapest bottles falling below P1,000, with the most expensive ones priced at around P20,000. But with taste as the priority at Wine Drop, customers can browse the shelves themselves, ranging from light, medium, and heavy reds to light and crisp and even acidic whites.\nAround 75 percent of the shop\u2019s selection are red wines, as Filipinos mostly prefer red wines.\nREAD:\nA natural wine education by way of three new bars\nAll members of Wine Drop\u2019s shop staff are also knowledgeable about wines, happily providing recommendations based on customer preferences.\nGuillot himself is very hands-on, having sourced nearly 80 percent of their wine selection. Being born in a winemaking family, Guillot has long been connected to winemakers from various countries. At Wine Drop, he shares, the goal is to really push for the wines by family-owned wine companies, especially the ones he personally can vouch for.\n\u201cI like to work with friends and it\u2019s easier for me to sell it to you or to the F&amp;B director and say, this [wine is by] my friend. When I look at all the labels, I know all the winemakers, and I\u2019m very happy to be the messenger for them.\u201d\nIn the store, Wine Drop has also partnered with chefs whose dishes and products make up the shop\u2019s concise menu. \u201cWe\u2019re not a bar or a restaurant,\u201d Guillot emphasizes. What started as a basic platter of cold cuts and cheese to simply accompany the wines being showcased eventually grew. \u201cIt\u2019s not enough. When people come here, they want to taste the wine, [so] they need food. If you drink without eating, you know what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d Guillot laughs.\nFrench masterchef\nCyrille Soenen\nhelped develop the les plats canaille menu for Wine Drop. Les plats canaille, Guillot explains, are French dishes meant to be shared at the table. \u201cYou put it in a big pot, a bit like when you\u2019re with your family and friends, and you put it in the middle and share.\u201d\nCassoulet, a slow-cooked stew popular in France\nCold cuts and cheese. The cheese board features cheese from Malagos farm in Davao\nFrom Soenen\u2019s CiCou are appetizers like chicken liver and pork head p\u00e2t\u00e9, beetroot salmon gravlax, quiche, and a light but delectable fougasse pissaladi\u00e8re. Hot dishes like beef bourguignon, chicken confit, and cassoulet as well as desserts like kouign-amann and chocolate moelleux are also available.\nMeanwhile, Spanish chef Chele Gonzalez stocks Wine Drop with deli favorites like the New York style beef brisket pastrami and grilled octopus a la Gallega. Blackpig supplies the shop with eight-inch pizzas alongside tapas by Txanton. Amid global fare, an assortment of cheese by local farm Malagos can also be enjoyed with cold cuts.\n\u201cThe Philippines is making fantastic cheese. Even as a Frenchman, I\u2019m so happy and proud we\u2019re putting Philippine cheese on our selection,\u201d Guillot says.\nIn crafting the menu, Guillot emphasizes the meals\u2019 shareability and pairing with wine.&nbsp;\nWine pairing is one of Wine Drop\u2019s primary campaigns, both on social media and in their events. On Instagram, a number of videos highlight different wines paired with various dishes and cuisines. Their events and collaborations also emphasize how wine can be paired with a variety of dishes, from pizza to oysters.\nFougasse pissaladi\u00e8re\nMaking wine approachable\n\u201cThe idea of Wine Drop is to make it fun as well. I really want to make wine fun and more accessible in terms of price and in terms of knowledge for everyone,\u201d Guillot says. \u201cIt\u2019s very important that we are able to teach but in a fun way.\u201d&nbsp;\nTrue to this mission, Wine Drop regularly holds Wine 101 sessions, and even wine game nights, where guests can learn trivia about wine all while enjoying glasses themselves.\nAmong the shelves bearing various wines are books and even board games all about winemaking and drinking. An impressive red box, for example, opens up to dozens of vials, each one representing a key ingredient or scent profile you\u2019d likely find in a variety of wines. The board game helps train the nose to pick up the various notes.\nWhile Wine Drop organizes regular wine communes and trivia nights, guests can also enjoy a short, impromptu Wine 101 session at the shop. Everyone\u2019s a wine expert in the shop, Guillot says, so it\u2019s definitely easy to simply ask to know more about the wine you\u2019re drinking.\nWine flights are one way to better understand wines\nAnd when it comes down to it, Guillot recommends really just drinking more to develop one\u2019s taste for wine. \u201cIt\u2019s basic, but drink more wine. When you drink, always look at the label and try to get three main pieces of information: the country, the region, and the grape varietal. And when you drink, put a note on your phone, and if you come [to us] with a list of wines you like and don\u2019t like, we can tell you what you should get.\u201d\n\u201cAnd come to Wine Drop, go for dinner with six friends. Let\u2019s do a Wine 101. For 30 minutes, you learn, and after, you have a great evening here. So at least, you get drunk, but you get smarter.\u201d\nRead more",

        "content": "Rodrigo Duterte \u2014BING GONZALES\nMANILA, Philippines \u2014 Former President Rodrigo Duterte appears to be at the \u201ccenter\u201d of a \u201cgrand criminal enterprise\u201d to wage a brutal war on drugs to enable and to profit from the very same scourge he had openly and strongly campaigned to eliminate, according to a preliminary report on a monthslong House inquiry.\nAs it turned out, Duterte was \u201cthe face of illegal drugs and criminality\u201d in the country, Antipolo Rep. Romeo Acop said late Thursday, reading a report on the findings of the House quad committee on the links between Philippine offshore gaming operators (Pogos), illegal drugs and extrajudicial killings (EJKs) during the previous administration.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\n\u201cLadies and gentlemen, the quad comm has started to uncover a grand criminal enterprise, and it would seem that at the center of it is former President Duterte,\u201d Acop said. \u201cNapakasakit po nito dahil pawang tayo ay nabudol. (This is so painful because we were all scammed).\u201d\nFEATURED STORIES\nNEWSINFO\nBar exam 2024: List of successful examinees\nNEWSINFO\n3 schools have highest percentage of passers among first-time bar exam takers\nNEWSINFO\nHouse panel: Ex-president Duterte center of grand criminal enterprise\nAcierto revelations\nHe said that a former \u201cright-hand man\u201d of Duterte who had testified during one quad committee hearing, dismissed narcotics officer Eduardo Acierto, described the former chief executive as the \u201clord of all drug lords.\u201d\n\u201cNapakasakit po dahil (It\u2019s very painful because) Mr. Duterte won on a platform of a hardline stance against illegal drugs and criminality. Siya pala ang mukha ng illegal drugs at kriminalidad. (It turned out that he was after all the face of illegal drugs and criminality),\u201d said Acop, a retired police general who was chief of the Criminal Investigation and Detection Group.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nHe said the quad committee\u2019s job was difficult and that no one wanted to go up against a popular former president. But like Duterte, lawmakers were elected by the people and have a responsibility to them, he said.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\n\u201cKaya ipagpapatuloy po natin ang ating inquiry at sisguraduhin po naming aayusin ang ating mga batas upang masiguro na hindi na mauulit ang mga kaganapang ating natuklasan. (That\u2019s why we will continue our inquiry and make sure to fix our laws so that none of these things that we have discovered would be repeated),\u201d Acop said.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nSummary of findings\nHe laid down a summary of the quad committee\u2019s findings from its inquiry which opened in August with testimonies and documents presented by dozens of \u201cresource persons,\u201d including retired and active duty police officers, relatives and supporters of drug war victims, local and national officials, and Duterte himself.\nAcop reported that Duterte and his inner circle used the drug war as a cover for the so-called \u201cDavao Mafia\u201d to profit off the drug trade and eliminate its competition.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nDuterte, who appeared before the panel on Nov. 13, had denied these allegations but admitted that he did encourage police officers to carry out his drug war by all means necessary to eradicate the scourge.\nThe former president also said he assumed responsibility for everything that happened under his campaign. The police\u2019s official report said over 6,000 people were killed during Duterte\u2019s presidency, but human rights groups believed the number could reach as high as 30,000.\nOther testimonies\nIn addition to Acierto, Acop cited the testimonies of former Bureau of Customs (BOC) intelligence officer Jimmy Guban, ex-BOC broker Mark Taguba, former Senators Leila de Lima and Antonio Trillanes IV, and former Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office general manager and retired police officer Royina Garma. They all identified either Duterte or people close to him as having links to the drug trade or to the human rights violations that came with his drug war.\n\u201cEach of these individuals carried with them intimate knowledge of the inner workings of the drug trade in the Philippines\u2014and what do they have in common? They spoke out and revealed what was really happening in the drug war, and because of this, they all suffered and earned the ire of the president,\u201d Acop said.\nYang connection\nDuterte\u2019s close associates included his former economic adviser, Chinese businessman Michael Yang, whom Acierto and Guban alleged was a drug lord himself and who supposedly owned a meth lab in Dumoy, Davao City, which was raided by the authorities in 2004.\nThough this case is now 20 years old, the Dumoy raid came under renewed scrutiny after Duterte admitted in a recent interview that he \u201celiminated everybody who was involved,\u201d including six Chinese nationals.\nYang allegedly has links to illegal Pogos with his business partner Allan Lim (also known as Lin Weixiong) and his brother Antonio Yang.\nAcierto, Taguba and Guban also linked Yang, Duterte\u2019s son, Davao Rep. Paolo Duterte, and his son-in-law Manases Carpio, to two major drug smuggling cases in 2017 and 2018, which involved P6.4 billion and P3.4 billion worth of crystal methamphetamine (\u201cshabu\u201d), respectively. They said the drugs were smuggled through the Manila International Container Terminal.\n\u2018Tara\u2019 system\nThese shipments supposedly bypassed inspections through the \u201ctara\u201d system\u2014a deeply entrenched bribery scheme within the BOC where millions of pesos in grease money facilitated the unimpeded entry of drugs.\nAcierto was the first to blow the whistle on Yang and reported this to Duterte, Sen. Christopher \u201cBong\u201d Go, and Sen. Ronald \u201cBato\u201d dela Rosa, but he was ignored, the former police colonel said.\nAcierto fled the country after supposedly learning of a plot to assassinate him. He is one of the witnesses in the case against Duterte in the International Criminal Court.\nOne of the most explosive testimonies during the hearings came from Garma, who alleged that there was a rewards system that incentivized the killing of drug offenders by police officers and that this was patterned after the scheme implemented by Duterte in Davao City where he was mayor for over two decades.\nConfirmation\nFormer Albuera, Leyte, police chief Col. Jovie Espenido confirmed the existence of the rewards system in which police officers received up to P100,000 for each alleged drug offender killed. He said the reward was managed by Go, a former special assistant to the President, who allegedly used money from confidential funds and profits from Small Town Lottery. Go has strongly denied this.\n\u201cThe existence of the rewards system is not denied,\u201d Acop said. \u201cIn fact, pinagmayabang pa ito ni former President Duterte at ang kanyang mga alipores (former President Duterte and his cohorts even bragged about it).\u201d\nThis reward system led to countless EJKs and \u201cso many of them were collateral damage,\u201d Acop said.\nDuterte made many incriminating statements at the quad committee hearing, including admitting that he had killed \u201csix or seven\u201d \u201ccriminals\u201d when he was mayor.\nHe also recalled that he often patrolled the streets of Davao on his motorbike in hopes of catching criminals and killing them himself.\nBato: No surprise\nDela Rosa said he was not surprised by Acop\u2019s conclusions.\nThe senator, Duterte\u2019s first Philippine National Police chief and the first implementer of the drug war, insisted that the House quad committee\u2019s mission was to \u201cdestroy the Dutertes.\u201d\n\u201cWe launched the war on drugs not to enrich ourselves, but to save this republic from becoming a narco state and save the Filipinos, especially the youth, from the evils of illegal drugs,\u201d Dela Rosa told the Inquirer.\n\u201cWe did not deceive the people. I swear before the graves of my policemen who offered the ultimate sacrifice in the war on drugs,\u201d he said.\nPNP data\nPNP data from July 2016 to June 2022 showed that 312 officers were killed and 974 were injured in Duterte\u2019s drug war.\nThe initial findings of the megapanel composed of the committees on human rights, dangerous drugs, public order and safety, and public accounts, will be presented to the plenary on Dec. 17.\nYour subscription could not be saved.

Meanwhile, they will be working on the legislative measures they filed as part of the quad committee\u2019s output, including a bill that would specifically penalize EJKs, Barbers said.\n\u2014WITH REPORTS FROM MARLON RAMOS, PNA, AND INQUIRER RESEARCH\nREAD NEXT\nPagasa: Cloudy weather, rain still likely in parts of PH\nEnforce discount laws,&nbsp;commuters tell LTFRB\nEDITORS' PICK\nBuilding a league of their own with the WMPBL\nGlow all out: Sparkly makeup to welcome the New Year\nRetired cop finds trove of unreleased Michael Jackson songs \u2013 report\nNBA: Embiid hit in face, misses 2nd half of 76ers' loss to Pacers\n2 PH enterprises recognized as Asia's best innovators\nMOST READ\nComelec exempts 48 projects from election ban\nLorraine Badoy after red-tagging civil suit loss: \u2018Fight isn\u2019t over\u2019\nBar exam 2024: List of successful examinees\n3 schools have highest percentage of passers among first-time bar exam takers\nFollow\n@FMangosingINQ\non Twitter\n-->\nView comments",

rates \u201cat the right time\u201d.\nThe annual Central Economic Work Conference was being closely watched for signs of more stimulus, though the announcement \u2014 which included stabilizing foreign trade and supporting the troubled property sector \u2014 was unable to boost sentiment.\nThe gathering came after Beijing began unveiling in September a raft of policies to reverse a growth slump that has gripped the economy for almost two years.\nJulian Evans-Pritchard of Capital Economics said it remained unclear how big a boost there would be, adding that, \u201cwhile we may get a near-term stimulus bounce, we\u2019re still not convinced that policy support will prevent the economy from slowing further next year\u201d.\nAnd strategists at Bank of America Global Research said:

survey indicated a slight increase in confidence among Japan\u2019s major manufacturers.\nSydney, Taipei and Manila also dropped while Singapore and Wellington edged up.\nSeoul also struggled following a three-day rebound from the selling sparked by South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol\u2019s brief martial law declaration, as the focus there turns to a second impeachment vote planned for Saturday.\nAll three main indexes in New York closed in the red, with investors taking to the sidelines ahead of the Fed\u2019s Wednesday gathering, when it is tipped to cut borrowing costs for the third time.\nHowever, there is growing concern that with inflation still above the bank\u2019s target \u2014 and president-elect Donald Trump pledging to cut taxes and impose tariffs \u2014 officials will not make as many next year as initially hoped.\n\u201cThere is a risk that inflationary pressures could change the central bank\u2019s plans,\u201d said Charu Chanana, chief investment strategist at Saxo Markets.\n\u201cRecent (consumer price index) reports show that inflation is still sticky, and if Trump\u2019s policies \u2014 like higher fiscal spending or tariffs \u2014 are enacted, inflation could re-accelerate.\n\u201cThis would give the Fed less room to ease, potentially leading to a hawkish surprise for markets.\u201d\nThe euro held around two-year lows after the European Central Bank cut rates and president Christine Lagarde warned the eurozone economy was \u201closing momentum\u201d, warning that \u201cthe risk of greater friction in global trade could weigh on euro

        "content": "FILE PHOTO: A Philippine offshore gaming operator (Pogo) hub operating behind the town hall of Bamban in Tarlac province has been shut down following a government raid in March 2024 due to human trafficking, online scams, and other illegal activities. INQUIRER/RICHARD A. REYES\nThe President\u2019s decision to ban Philippine offshore gaming operators (Pogos) has presented new challenges for the government, particularly the legal gaps related to managing assets such as buildings and lands confiscated from alleged criminal operations linked to these hubs.\nOver the past months, lawmakers and officials have proposed various uses for the idle properties, including converting them into evacuation centers, schools, or government offices.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nHowever, Justice Undersecretary Nicholas Ty, head of the Inter-Agency Council Against Trafficking (Iacat) established by law in 2012, highlighted one of the many concerns they faced: the need for immediate access to the resources seized from suspected scam hubs to support trafficking victims and Pogo employees rescued during raids.\nFEATURED STORIES\nGLOBALNATION\nPH asserts rights over Bajo de Masinloc at UN General Assembly\nGLOBALNATION\nPCG: China using AIS spoofing to mislead public and stir confusion\nGLOBALNATION\n'Aid for Kristine-hit Batangas': Presidential assistance for farmers, fisherfolk, families\n\u201c[There is] an absence of a clear provision that expressly empowers [the] state [to] provisionally use assets pending forfeiture, especially money that can be used to maintain victims and facilities,\u201d Ty told the Inquirer on Thursday.\nREAD:\nAuthorities raid Pogo hub in Bataan BPO company\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nAlthough the Anti-Financial Account Scamming Act signed in July 2024 addresses this matter, Ty noted that Iacat was still waiting for its implementing rules and regulations.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nIn the meantime, the government found a \u201ccreative solution\u201d\u2014\u201ccommandeering\u201d raided facilities and using them to house thousands of trafficking victims, he said.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nAccording to Iacat\u2019s records, over 3,000 Pogo employees have been rescued and \u201cpresumed to be victims of human trafficking.\u201d\n\u201cWe do not really have enough shelters to house these victims of trafficking, and if we do let them out, chances are they are just gonna be re-trafficked or revictimized in another scam hub,\u201d Ty said during a forum last Tuesday organized by the Stratbase ADR Institute.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nA comprehensive inventory of the total number of buildings, floor area, land area, and estimated value has not been published by the authorities following the raids on these hubs, notably those in Bamban, Tarlac, and Porac, Pampanga.\nThere has also been no disclosure of any plan by responsible government agencies to inspect these properties to determine whether they were suitable for classrooms, offices, medical facilities, evacuation centers, or other purposes while criminal and civil forfeiture cases are pending.\nNew Marcos warning\nLess than three weeks before his year-end deadline to shut down all Pogos in the country, which he announced in his State of the Nation Address in July, President Marcos warned that those who run \u201cguerrilla\u201d or rogue Pogo and internet gaming licensees (IGLs) after he had canceled all their licenses.\nMr. Marcos formalized the ban in November under Executive Order No. 74.\n\u201cWe will never let them wreak havoc on us again. Anyone who attempts to launch illegal operations will face the full force of our laws,\u201d the President said.\nHe posted his remarks on Facebook and Instagram on Wednesday night, after meeting with Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corp. (Pagcor) chair Alejandro Tengco, Presidential Anti-Organized Crime Commission (PAOCC) chief Gilbert Cruz, Interior Secretary Juan Victor \u201cJonvic\u201d Remulla and other government officials on winding down the operations of the remaining offshore gaming hubs.\nOn Thursday morning, the President ordered law enforcement agencies to carry out small but multiple operations against offshore gaming operators that were still running their businesses despite the ban.\nHe directed local officials to coordinate with the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) in going after Pogos and IGLs in their areas and ordered the DILG to step up gathering intelligence on the presence of Pogos in communities.\nCanceled licenses\nAccording to Malaca\u00f1ang, 53,700 Pogo licenses were canceled, while 18 IGLs voluntarily canceled theirs as of Nov. 29. By Dec. 31, all licenses will be deemed canceled, and the Philippines will supposedly be \u201cPogo-free\u201d by January 2025.\nIt said 353,000 visas had been issued to foreign workers for these gaming establishments. By the end of the Duterte administration, only 33,863 remained, and 23,099 of them recently left the country.\nMany more foreigners, mostly Chinese, entered the country as tourists and found jobs as Pogo workers, according to a Senate investigation of the pastillas scam. The total number of foreign workers working legally and illegally in Pogos could far exceed the number of legitimate employment visas issued by the government.\nDuring Tuesday\u2019s forum, Ty said that since Pogo hubs were usually one-stop shops, not just the offices but actual residences of the trafficking victims, the government used the facilities to temporarily house rescued workers there.\nHe said that under the Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act, \u201cproceeds of instruments of human trafficking can be forfeited in favor of Iacat for the benefit of victims of human trafficking.\u201d\nNo typical victim\nAnother significant legal challenge is \u201cvictim identification\u201d and \u201cforced criminality\u201d because many rescued individuals refuse to see themselves as trafficking victims, Ty said.\nHe said that human trafficking, often described as modern-day slavery, differs from past enslavement where victims were treated as property.\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s why it becomes even more complex in the victimology of the trafficking victims and the scam hubs. Because they are not, at least from the Philippine perspective, the typical trafficking victim who is from a very poor location who is mired in poverty, who is not that educated,\u201d he explained.\n\u201cThe victims of human trafficking, at least from the Philippines\u2014well, even from other countries\u2014they\u2019re usually college graduates from middle-income families. They\u2019re tech-savvy,\u201d Ty added.\nHe said the authorities will use other measures, such as anticorruption laws, to prosecute \u201cother enablers\u201d of human trafficking like government officials.\n\u2018Leakage\u2019 probe\nFor its part, the Supreme Court said it found no evidence linking members of the judiciary to the alleged \u201cleakage\u201d of information regarding the Porac raid last June.\nChief Justice Alexander Gesmundo on Wednesday told reporters that preliminary inquiries \u201cdid not get positive results\u201d and that judges and court staff were involved.\nWhen authorities raided the Pogo compound in Porac, the PAOCC found only 158 Chinese, Vietnamese, and Malaysians instead of the more than 1,000 individuals who were supposedly there at the time\u2014an indication that the operators had insider information about the raid.\nSen. Sherwin Gatchalian later alleged the result of the raid showed the possible influence of Chinese syndicates in the judiciary and that when PAOCC requested a search warrant, the Pogo operators received a tip.\nYour subscription could not be saved.

        "content": "Rewriting Philippine history is not exclusive to academics. Politicians indulge in it too, when they name or rename the streets that define us. Take Arsenio H. Lacson street, named after the feisty mayor of Manila who served from 1952-1962, that connects Sampaloc to Nagtahan and Pandacan.\nPeople born in the last century, like me, remember it as \u201cPor-Bes,\u201d named after William Cameron Forbes who served as the United States governor general from 1909-1913. But Forbes has not been completely erased from the landscape because of Forbes Park in Makati. While Forbes Park remains the premiere gated community in the country, its reputation is far from aspirational in some sectors. Taipan Lucio Tan used to refer to it, in jest, as \u201cPobres Park,\u201d referring to the number of mortgaged, hard-to-sell properties, in the enclave.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nForbes came to mind recently when I went on a tour of \u201cMansion House,\u201d the official summer residence of American governors general and later Philippine presidents. Many years ago, I thought aloud, \u201cIsn\u2019t Mansion House redundant? Aba! Mansion na, House pa?\u201d I was glad when the giant Instagrammable sign on its lawn declared, \u201cThe Mansion.\u201d\nFEATURED STORIES\nOPINION\nUrgent action needed vs online piracy as Congress session nears end\nOPINION\nLife has shortened\nOPINION\nThe gift of second chances\nWhile grammatically correct and tighter to an editor\u2019s eye, I found that Forbes had a vacation home in the US called \u201cMansion House.\u201d From a 1907 publication, I learned that Mansion House was built on the highest site in Baguio, and that Governor Forbes\u2019 summer residence was called \u201cTopside.\u201d\nI had never been inside Mansion House and always saw it from outside its elegant wrought iron gate. It is open to the public now, thanks to the initiative of First Lady Liza A. Marcos, as a museum of Philippine presidents and the presidency. You can register for a tour slot online, but none were available and we were only in Baguio for two nights, so we tried our luck as \u201cwalk-in\u201d patrons. Being seniors must have helped because everywhere we went, the young staff were courteous and attentive. This is a welcome change from being made to wait or asked to return another day at government offices.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nAfter registration, where ID details were taken down and a contact number requested, we boarded a golf cart that took us up the long driveway where we were met and told to catch up with the 9 a.m. tour group. We were reminded that photography is prohibited in the exhibit halls, a policy that has to be relaxed because there is so much historical data on the walls. Interested patrons should be allowed to take pictures not just of the wall texts, but the few presidential memorabilia on display.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThe first room was an introduction to Mansion House and Baguio. Archival photographs brought visitors back to the time when it was a colonial hill station. One must remember that in an age without air-conditioning, the heavyweight first civil governor William Howard Taft suffered in Manila\u2019s heat. Baguio as a \u201csummer capital\u201d was just that: in the hot months, the whole government transferred and operated there. This explains why we have Cabinet Hill with cottages for all department secretaries. Teachers Camp was for training, meetings, as well as rest and recreation. Today, only the Supreme Court comes up for summer sessions.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nFrom the first room, one proceeds along a narrow hall lined with portraits of all the First Ladies of the Philippines, from Hilaria Aguinaldo to Liza Marcos. While students are introduced to the sequence of Philippine presidents in Araling Panlipunan, first ladies are only remembered by the bright ones who compete in quiz bees. The list goes: Hilaria Aguinaldo, Aurora Quezon, Paciencia Laurel, Esperanza Osme\u00f1a, Trinidad Roxas, Victoria Quirino (not a spouse but a daughter because Elpidio Quirino was a widower), Luz Magsaysay, Leonila Garcia, Eva Macapagal, Imelda Marcos, Amelita Ramos, Loi Ejercito, Jose Miguel Arroyo (the only thorn among the proverbial roses because the President was a woman), and Liza Marcos. There were three vacancies: Corazon Aquino was a widow and her son Benigno S. Aquino III was a bachelor so they both went solo and did not designate a person to fill the role. With Rodrigo Duterte, it was complicated, no one was designated.\nThe rest of the galleries cover each president from Aguinaldo to Marcos Jr. Wall texts provide: biographical details, term of office, significant achievements, a portrait, quotable quote, and a facsimile signature. In vitrines are photographs and memorabilia. Our tour guide showed public history in practice, making each president human in her spiel. My only problem was that in the timeline for Ferdinand E. Marcos Sr., there was no reference to the 1986 people power that led to his \u201cexile.\u201d Since Feb. 25 and Aug. 21 remain holidays under the second Marcos administration, curators should have taken the cue and simply stated fact instead of inviting criticism through a glaring omission.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013\nComments are welcome at aocampo@ateneo.edu\nYour subscription could not be saved.

        "content": "Indonesia\u2014Since their invention in the early 20th century, plastics have been omnipresent in our daily life, and have become a global choice due to their durability, flexibility, and low production cost. Industries ranging from food to electronics have been relying for decades on plastics, their primary material for product packaging. Plastic serves as protection, marketing and information tool, and a convenient way to transport products. For optimal performance, plastic is often combined with other materials, making it difficult to recycle.\nDespite the ample benefits, plastic\u2019s versatility may pose risks to health and the environment. Since the 1950s, plastic consumption has surged, reaching 400.3 million tons in global production in 2022 alone, much of them for single-use packaging to preserve food and protect fragile items.\nBut environmental alarms are sounding. Researcher Hannah Ritchie and colleagues estimate that 0.5 percent of plastics end up in the ocean, harming marine ecosystems. Traces of plastic also pollute mountains, forests, and waterways.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nTo deal with the problem, businesses and governments have been showing a stronger commitment. The fifth Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee (INC-5) on Plastic Pollution from Nov. 25 to Dec. 1 in Busan, South Korea, was meant to draft an international legally binding instrument to tackle the plastic pollution problem.\nFEATURED STORIES\nOPINION\nUrgent action needed vs online piracy as Congress session nears end\nOPINION\nLife has shortened\nOPINION\nThe gift of second chances\nThe momentum is building as over 260 businesses, from multinationals to local enterprises, have joined the Business Coalition for a Global Plastics Treaty (BCGPT), urging governments at INC-5 to adopt an ambitious, full-lifecycle plastics treaty. This collective effort also aims to foster awareness, innovation, and a sustainable ecosystem with the prospect of global regulations under a treaty.\nIndustry has also been exploring solutions like optimizing and harmonizing packaging (Reduce), reusable packaging, and design for recycling. It has also been increasing recycled content along with developing bioplastics and paper-based options to reduce virgin plastic use. These innovations require comprehensive life cycle assessments and suitable waste management for bio-based plastics to ensure sustainable impact.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nAs well, food and beverage packaging must meet strict safety and compliance standards to protect consumers. Key guidelines include Food and Drug Monitoring Agency Regulation No. 20/2019, and international standards like those from the United States Food and Drug Administration, the European Medicines Agency, and the European Food Safety Authority, detailing permitted, limited, and banned substances. Additionally, packaging should be environmentally safe, functional, competitively priced, and of high quality.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nLeading producers of fast-moving consumer goods have also optimized packaging size, increased recycled content and used easier-to-recycle materials. They\u2019ve introduced reusable designs and innovations as well, like paper straws.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nBut are these alternatives enough to address the plastic crisis?\nRecycling is important, but not enough. In fact, less than 10 percent of plastic waste is currently recycled globally. The remaining waste often ends up being incinerated in landfills.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThen there\u2019s the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) program, which requires companies to manage their products\u2019 end-of-life, which is now gaining traction, especially in developed countries with advanced waste management. However, for EPR to be effective globally, stronger waste management systems are essential, particularly in developing countries where they remain inadequate and poorly managed, leading to high rates of plastic leakage into rivers and oceans.\nI\u2019d strongly suggest maximizing our efforts for waste collection, waste segregation, and building the infrastructure to process related waste. We must ensure greater quantity and better quality feedstock for secondary raw materials to increase the recycling rate and recycled content. For packaging, we can work on nonfood contact material if the food contact material is not yet available.\nWe also need stricter but more conducive regulations to prevent plastic leakage and to promote and encourage the use of sustainable materials, given the higher costs incurred when industry switches to easy-to-recycle materials or to recycled-content materials. Waste management systems should not create new problems, such as improper disposal of hazardous byproducts.\nThe plastic crisis requires multiple solutions. Global rules can unify multi-stakeholder efforts to phase out problematic plastics, but consumer behavior change is also essential. Now is the time to advocate for stronger regulations, better waste management, and a collective shift in consumption and production. Plastics were considered a \u201cmiracle\u201d when they were first introduced for packaging. They now pose challenges and are perceived as a symbol of unsustainability.\nIt is time to rethink our relationship with plastics for the sake of the planet.

        "content": "Make America Great Again! (MAGA)\u201d\nSo goes the campaign slogan of reelected United States President Donald Trump. Interestingly, it isn\u2019t all that original since a similar one was used back in 1965 by then Sen. Ferdinand E. Marcos Sr. during his successful march to his first term as Philippine president.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nWith Trump\u2019s imminent assumption of office, the air is rife with speculations on how he would actually translate his campaign slogan into reality via specific programs, legislative proposals, and foreign policy. From the thrust of statements he\u2019s been making, it seems he intends to effect major structural policy and even sociopolitical changes on both the domestic and foreign affairs fronts. I will leave it to others to discuss sociopolitical matters, as those are more peculiar to American societal interaction that many others are more familiar with.\nFEATURED STORIES\nOPINION\nUrgent action needed vs online piracy as Congress session nears end\nOPINION\nLife has shortened\nOPINION\nThe gift of second chances\nSuffice it for me to observe, at the risk of being simplistic, that he appears determined to restore \u201ctraditional values,\u201d and put the brakes on the forward march of progressive liberalism particularly its so called \u201cwoke\u201d fringe. Somewhat associated with these are two of his highest priorities: securing US borders from the recent surge of illegal migrants, and rebalancing (as he sees it) the country\u2019s energy sector development strategy from a rapid headlong plunge into renewable energy dependence, toward a somewhat more gradual transition to that goal by restoring fossil fuel exploration, or as he puts it, \u201cDrill baby, drill.\u201d\nOn the domestic economic front, his game plan appears aimed at restoring dynamic economic growth by tax cuts and reduced government regulation. This, he hopes, would energize the private sector and put more disposable income in the pockets of the middle and working class, entrepreneurs, and corporations, thus creating jobs and hopefully, a virtuous cycle of higher employment rates that would broaden the tax base and generate a more positive budget outcome to meet the pressing financing needs of, among others, modernizing the country\u2019s infrastructure.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThe downside to this strategy is that the effect of tax cuts has a lag time during which already serious fiscal deficits may grow, resulting in even greater temptation to print money that will end up fueling inflation and escalating the level of national debt that even now threatens to become unmanageable. This latter vicious cycle outcome Trump hopes to stem by serious cuts in expenditure.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nSuch cuts appear to depend mainly on a draconian review of \u201cwasteful government expenditures\u201d by the envisioned new Department of Government Efficiency led by Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy. This involves the surgical trimming of perceived bloated bureaucracy in such agencies as the departments of education and of defense, and defense expenditure itself. The US defense budget is 10 times that of the next 10 countries in the world combined as it maintains 750 military bases in 80 countries. Furthermore, an announced centerpiece of Trump\u2019s foreign policy is to proactively encourage negotiations toward peace on all major war fronts, if only to carry the record of having no wars during his tenure.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nHowever, the bellicose side of his foreign policy, namely tariff drumbeating designed, it seems, to restore a more vibrant manufacturing sector to the US economy, could be problematic. He may find that his tendency toward breast beating may have to be balanced by his equally adept sense of the \u201cart of the deal\u201d toward win-win solutions in a world where BRICS\u2014a forum for cooperation among a group of emerging economies including Brazil, Russia, China and the United Arab Emirates\u2014is a serious reality rather than a pushover. As well, the evolution from a unipolar to a multipolar world order appears to be gaining momentum so that moves to preserve US trade and military dominance may have to be tempered with a wiser strategy of revitalizing US competitiveness toward winning the hearts and minds of the world\u2019s citizenry.\nAssuming things go reasonably well toward the MAGA scenario, what\u2019s in it for the Philippines? At the very least, a US economy averting pneumonia will help stabilize the value of the peso and continue the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas\u2019 already optimistic scenario of progressively lowering interest rates. There are also signs that the US is more interested in an investment-oriented, rather than a China-containment, policy with us, such that Musk is reportedly eyeing the Philippines as a significant center for his expanded Asian business operations.

        "content": "On the fateful evening of Dec. 2, as the BRP Datu Tamblot and its crew braved the calm waters near Hasa-Hasa Shoal, they were met with an unexpected guest\u2014a high-intensity laser beam from an unidentified Chinese vessel. As the green beam pierced the darkness, one could almost imagine it as an unorthodox holiday greeting, albeit one that could potentially blind our sailors.\nIncidents like these remind us of the challenges faced by our courageous men and women guarding the waters of the West Philippine Sea. Hasa-Hasa Shoal, a part of our exclusive economic zone (EEZ), isn\u2019t just a spot on the map\u2014it\u2019s a resource-rich area teeming with marine life, a haven for Filipino fishers, and a symbol of our national identity.\nWhile the laser incident might sound like a scene from a sci-fi movie, it\u2019s a stark reminder of the reality we face: a need to assert our sovereign rights without losing sight of diplomacy and peace. Let us not be intimidated by these bright displays; instead, let them serve as a spotlight on the pressing need for unity\u2014both domestically and internationally.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThe Philippines has always been a nation that values dialogue, justice, and mutual respect. We have demonstrated our commitment to these principles through the legal and diplomatic avenues we\u2019ve pursued, most notably the 2016 arbitral ruling that affirmed our rights in the West Philippine Sea.\nFEATURED STORIES\nOPINION\nUrgent action needed vs online piracy as Congress session nears end\nOPINION\nLife has shortened\nOPINION\nThe gift of second chances\nYet, these rights are not just about us. They resonate with all nations that believe in the rule of law and the importance of maintaining peace and stability in international waters. Our maritime zones are part of a larger network that supports global trade, biodiversity, and climate resilience. Protecting these waters is a shared responsibility.\nWe call on our friends in the international community to shine a light of their own on this issue. This is not merely a bilateral matter between the Philippines and China; it\u2019s a question of respecting international law and ensuring that no nation can claim what isn\u2019t theirs through coercion or force.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nFrom Asean partners to the broader global family, we urge you to amplify your voices. Support initiatives that uphold peace and the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (Unclos). Stand with us in asserting that the future of these waters lies in sustainable development, not conflict.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nTo our fellow Filipinos, let this serve as a rallying cry\u2014not to war, but to unwavering vigilance and unity. Every fisher who sails these waters, every soldier who guards our outposts, and every citizen who supports our claim, strengthens our stance. Together, we are a nation that believes in fairness, peace, and sovereignty.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nAnd to the unidentified vessel that brought a light show to Hasa-Hasa Shoal, let this be our message: the Philippines does not stand in darkness. We are guided by the light of our laws, our allies, and our indomitable spirit.\nSo, let us steer forward, navigating these contested waters with confidence. The beam of justice and unity will always shine brighter than any laser.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nShermaine Anacleto,\nsheanacleto@gmail.com\nYour subscription could not be saved.

Duterte\u2019s office for his comment on the issue, but his staffer said that the lawmaker would not issue a statement since they do not know each other.\nThis is not the first time that Taguba and Guban implicated the younger Duterte as supposedly involved in smuggling.\nAt the first quad committee hearing in Pampanga last August 16,\nGuban said he was cautioned against naming Rep. Duterte\n, his brother-in-law and Vice President Sara Duterte\u2019s husband Manases Carpio, and businessman Michael Yang as involved in the \u201cshabu\u201d importation mess.\nRep. Duterte however questioned Guban\u2019s credibility, saying that\nhe does not know Guban\nand that he has never transacted with the former BOC official.&nbsp; The lawmaker also noted that the label \u201cstar witness\u201d is only reserved for individuals with credibility and not Guban, who had been cited for contempt by the Senate blue ribbon committee.\nTaguba meanwhile claimed during a previous quad committee hearing that\nhe never retracted his allegations that Rep.

REYES\nThe President\u2019s decision to ban Philippine offshore gaming operators (Pogos) has presented new challenges for the government, particularly the legal gaps related to managing assets such as buildings and lands confiscated from alleged criminal operations linked to these hubs.\nOver the past months, lawmakers and officials have proposed various uses for the idle properties, including converting them into evacuation centers, schools, or government offices.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nHowever, Justice Undersecretary Nicholas Ty, head of the Inter-Agency Council Against Trafficking (Iacat) established by law in 2012, highlighted one of the many concerns they faced: the need for immediate access to the resources seized from suspected scam hubs to support trafficking victims and Pogo employees rescued during raids.\nFEATURED STORIES\nGLOBALNATION\nPH asserts rights over Bajo de Masinloc at UN General Assembly\nGLOBALNATION\nPCG: China using AIS spoofing to mislead public and stir confusion\nGLOBALNATION\n'Aid for Kristine-hit Batangas': Presidential assistance for farmers, fisherfolk, families\n\u201c[There is] an absence of a clear provision that expressly empowers [the] state [to] provisionally use assets pending forfeiture, especially money that can be used to maintain victims and facilities,\u201d Ty told the Inquirer on Thursday.\nREAD:\nAuthorities raid Pogo hub in Bataan BPO company\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nAlthough the Anti-Financial Account Scamming Act signed in July 2024 addresses this matter, Ty noted that Iacat was still waiting for its implementing rules and regulations.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nIn the meantime, the government found a \u201ccreative solution\u201d\u2014\u201ccommandeering\u201d raided facilities and using them to house thousands of trafficking victims, he said.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nAccording to Iacat\u2019s records, over 3,000 Pogo employees have been rescued and \u201cpresumed to be victims of human trafficking.\u201d\n\u201cWe do not really have enough shelters to house these victims of trafficking, and if we do let them out, chances are they are just gonna be re-trafficked or revictimized in another scam hub,\u201d Ty said during a forum last Tuesday organized by the Stratbase ADR Institute.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nA comprehensive inventory of the total number of buildings, floor area, land area, and estimated value has not been published by the authorities following the raids on these hubs, notably those in Bamban, Tarlac, and Porac, Pampanga.\nThere has also been no disclosure of any plan by responsible government agencies to inspect these properties to determine whether they were suitable for classrooms, offices, medical facilities, evacuation centers, or other purposes while criminal and civil forfeiture cases are pending.\nNew Marcos warning\nLess than three weeks before his year-end deadline to shut down all Pogos in the country, which he announced in his State of the Nation Address in July, President Marcos warned that those who run \u201cguerrilla\u201d or rogue Pogo and internet gaming licensees (IGLs) after he had canceled all their licenses.\nMr. Marcos formalized the ban in November under Executive Order No. 74.\n\u201cWe will never let them wreak havoc on us again. Anyone who attempts to launch illegal operations will face the full force of our laws,\u201d the President said.\nHe posted his remarks on Facebook and Instagram on Wednesday night, after meeting with Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corp. (Pagcor) chair Alejandro Tengco, Presidential Anti-Organized Crime Commission (PAOCC) chief Gilbert Cruz, Interior Secretary Juan Victor \u201cJonvic\u201d Remulla and other government officials on winding down the operations of the remaining offshore gaming hubs.\nOn Thursday morning, the President ordered law enforcement agencies to carry out small but multiple operations against offshore gaming operators that were still running their businesses despite the ban.\nHe directed local officials to coordinate with the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) in going after Pogos and IGLs in their areas and ordered the DILG to step up gathering intelligence on the presence of Pogos in communities.\nCanceled licenses\nAccording to Malaca\u00f1ang, 53,700 Pogo licenses were canceled, while 18 IGLs voluntarily canceled theirs as of Nov. 29. By Dec. 31, all licenses will be deemed canceled, and the Philippines will supposedly be \u201cPogo-free\u201d by January 2025.\nIt said 353,000 visas had been issued to foreign workers for these gaming establishments. By the end of the Duterte administration, only 33,863 remained, and 23,099 of them recently left the country.\nMany more foreigners, mostly Chinese, entered the country as tourists and found jobs as Pogo workers, according to a Senate investigation of the pastillas scam. The total number of foreign workers working legally and illegally in Pogos could far exceed the number of legitimate employment visas issued by the government.\nDuring Tuesday\u2019s forum, Ty said that since Pogo hubs were usually one-stop shops, not just the offices but actual residences of the trafficking victims, the government used the facilities to temporarily house rescued workers there.\nHe said that under the Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act, \u201cproceeds of instruments of human trafficking can be forfeited in favor of Iacat for the benefit of victims of human trafficking.\u201d\nNo typical victim\nAnother significant legal challenge is \u201cvictim identification\u201d and \u201cforced criminality\u201d because many rescued individuals refuse to see themselves as trafficking victims, Ty said.\nHe said that human trafficking, often described as modern-day slavery, differs from past enslavement where victims were treated as property.\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s why it becomes even more complex in the victimology of the trafficking victims and the scam hubs. Because they are not, at least from the Philippine perspective, the typical trafficking victim who is from a very poor location who is mired in poverty, who is not that educated,\u201d he explained.\n\u201cThe victims of human trafficking, at least from the Philippines\u2014well, even from other countries\u2014they\u2019re usually college graduates from middle-income families. They\u2019re tech-savvy,\u201d Ty added.\nHe said the authorities will use other measures, such as anticorruption laws, to prosecute \u201cother enablers\u201d of human trafficking like government officials.\n\u2018Leakage\u2019 probe\nFor its part, the Supreme Court said it found no evidence linking members of the judiciary to the alleged \u201cleakage\u201d of information regarding the Porac raid last June.\nChief Justice Alexander Gesmundo on Wednesday told reporters that preliminary inquiries \u201cdid not get positive results\u201d and that judges and court staff were involved.\nWhen authorities raided the Pogo compound in Porac, the PAOCC found only 158 Chinese, Vietnamese, and Malaysians instead of the more than 1,000 individuals who were supposedly there at the time\u2014an indication that the operators had insider information about the raid.\nSen. Sherwin Gatchalian later alleged the result of the raid showed the possible influence of Chinese syndicates in the judiciary and that when PAOCC requested a search warrant, the Pogo operators received a tip.\nYour subscription could not be saved.

But the Philippine Coast Guard suspected it was probably just a glitch.\u2014Contributed photo\nSAN ANTONIO, ZAMBALES, Philippines \u2014 Residents of San Felipe town in this province were alarmed on Tuesday after seeing in a marine tracker what appeared to be a China Coast Guard (CCG) vessel near a dredging site.\nLocals who routinely monitor vessels operating in the Sto. Tomas River were taken aback upon detecting a vessel identified as a CCG ship with body No. 21543 approaching the area, according to Elezer Requirme, a resident and beach resort owner.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\n\u201cThere are currently four dredging vessels operating in the area, hauling sand and transporting it to a reclamation site in Manila Bay,\u201d Requirme said in a phone interview.\nFEATURED STORIES\nNEWSINFO\nBar exam 2024: List of successful examinees\nNEWSINFO\n3 schools have highest percentage of passers among first-time bar exam takers\nNEWSINFO\nHouse panel: Ex-president Duterte center of grand criminal enterprise\nHe said the vessel they saw appeared to be a CCG vessel on the tracker.\n\u201cWhen we checked again, it disappeared from the tracker, as though its AIS (automatic identification system) had been turned off,\u201d Requirme said.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nRequirme is among the residents who have been opposed to dredging operations in the province and a member of the group that monitors dredging vessels in Sto. Tomas using a marine tracker app.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nImmediate inspection\nResponding to their concerns, the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) personnel in Zambales immediately boarded all dredging vessels in the area for inspection.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nCmdr. Euphraim Jayson Diciano, chief of the PCG station in Zambales, assured residents that all vessels would be closely monitored, noting that their detection of a suspected CCG vessel may have been just due to a technical glitch.\n\u201cWe have located the vessel of concern and it is currently in Guangzhou, China. It could not have been in San Felipe because if the AIS was turned off, the marine tracker would only display its last known position,\u201d Diciano explained in a phone interview.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nUndocumented crew\nThe Zambales residents raised the matter a day after Sen. Risa Hontiveros also sounded the alarm over possible Chinese espionage using dredging operations as cover.\nIn a privilege speech on Monday, Hontiveros, the Senate deputy minority leader, cited a PCG report on the discovery of 13 undocumented Chinese nationals on the dredging vessel MV Harvest 89 in Mariveles, Bataan province, on Nov. 26.\n\u201cThe PCG personnel were shocked that during a routine predeparture inspection to secure a Masters Declaration of Safe Departure, the crew members attempted to deny them entry,\u201d she said.\n\u201cThe crew members told the PCG that their documentation was okay. Smelling a rat, our coast guards boarded the vessel where they discovered nine undocumented Chinese crew members, and when they searched deeper, they found four more, bringing the total to 13,\u201d the opposition senator added.\n\u2018PLA\u2019 uniform\nWhat\u2019s more shocking, Hontiveros said, was the discovery inside the vessel of a People\u2019s Liberation Army uniform similar to what was found in illegal Philippine offshore gaming operator (Pogo) hubs.\nShe noted that this was not the first time the PCG caught dredging vessels engaged in suspicious activities.\nIn May this year, the PCG also apprehended a vessel pretending to carry a Philippine flag when it was actually registered in Sierra Leone. Its crew members were all Chinese nationals, she said.\n\u201cThe presence of undocumented Chinese nationals aboard a vessel engaged in such contentious operations is a chilling revelation. What were they doing there? Who permitted their entry? Were they acting as laborers, or, as some fear, engaging in activities of an intelligence-gathering nature?\u201d asked Hontiveros.\n\u201cEspionage is not merely the stuff of spy novels. As we have sadly learned due to recent events, it is a clear and present danger in the modern geopolitical landscape. As Nica (National Intelligence Coordinating Agency) had said during our recently concluded Pogo hearings in which a Philippine mayor was confirmed by our intelligence apparatus to be an \u2018agent of influence,\u2019 all regions of our country have been infiltrated by agents of the Chinese Communist Party,\u201d she added.\n\u2018Nasasalisihan tayo\u2019\nHontiveros was referring to Alice Guo, the dismissed mayor of Bamban, Tarlac, who is now detained and facing charges after being linked to an online gaming hub that was raided in her town.\n\u201cWhen foreign nationals operate covertly in our territory, it compromises not only our security apparatus but also the trust of our citizens in the government\u2019s ability to protect them,\u201d she said.\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m scared of is that while we are busy with all that\u2019s happening in our country, our enemies are creeping in (nasasalisihan tayo),\u201d she added.\nIn her speech, Hontiveros said the company behind the dredging activity in Bataan was the China state-run firm China Harbour Engineer Co. (CHEC) which was earlier blacklisted by the United States for its alleged role in the militarization of the South China Sea, as well as by the World Trade Organization for alleged corrupt practices.\nEnvironmental damage\nHontiveros urged the Department of Justice, through the Bureau of Immigration, to investigate the undocumented persons aboard the vessels and review their Alien Employment Certificates issued by the Department of Labor and Employment.\nShe also asked the Department of Environment and Natural Resources to conduct an exhaustive assessment of the environmental damage caused by the dredging operations and hold responsible parties accountable.\nHontiveros said there should also be a review of all existing agreements that permit foreign entities to engage in resource extraction or related activities within Philippine waters to ensure that the agreements align not just with ecological preservation but also with national security.\nYour subscription could not be saved.

        "content": "The jubilant streets of Damascus are awash with a sense of freedom. Women perform the \u201czaghrouta,\u201d a piercing, celebratory ululation; men chant slogans; and the nation collectively breathes a sigh of relief. The fall of Bashar al-Assad and his flight to Moscow signals the end of an era of repression. Yet, amidst the celebrations, the echoes of history remind us that such moments are but the first steps in the arduous journey of transition.\nAssad\u2019s dramatic departure is reminiscent of other despots forced into exile: Ferdinand Marcos Sr. fleeing to Hawaii in 1986, laden with treasures looted from the Philippine people; Muammar Gaddafi\u2019s brutal demise in Libya; and Saddam Hussein\u2019s humiliating fall in Iraq. Each instance of a dictator\u2019s downfall has triggered euphoria, but also exposed deep challenges in the aftermath. For Syria, these challenges loom large, as the nation grapples with the legacies of autocratic rule, civil war, and external meddling.\nFor over 50 years, the Assad family ruled with an iron fist, crushing dissent and maintaining power through a maze of alliances. The civil war that erupted in 2011 triggered heightened repression, leading to decades of unimaginable suffering: hundreds of thousands dead and millions displaced.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nScenes of jubilation in Syria mirror those of the Edsa People Power Revolution in the Philippines, where citizens took to the streets to topple Marcos Sr.\u2019s regime. Just as Filipinos dismantled the vestiges of a dictator\u2019s reign\u2014smashing statues and reclaiming public spaces\u2014Syrians now seize the moment to exorcise symbols of the Assad family\u2019s domination. Yet, while the Philippines managed a relatively swift transition to democratic rule, Syria\u2019s path is far more uncertain.\nFEATURED STORIES\nOPINION\nUrgent action needed vs online piracy as Congress session nears end\nOPINION\nLife has shortened\nOPINION\nThe gift of second chances\nHistory offers cautionary tales for Syria. Libya and Iraq, both torn apart after the fall of autocratic regimes, failed to establish stable political orders. These examples highlight the dangers of power vacuums and unbridled factionalism. Syria\u2019s deeply fragmented opposition, including Islamist groups like Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and Kurdish factions under the Syrian Democratic Forces, is emblematic of these challenges. HTS, despite its pledge to embrace inclusivity, remains burdened by a controversial past with ties to al-Qaida, casting doubt on its ability to foster unity.\nThe stakes are further complicated by Syria\u2019s geopolitical significance. Regional powers such as Turkey, Iran, and Israel, alongside global actors like Russia and the United States, have entrenched themselves in the conflict. Israel\u2019s recent seizure of a buffer zone in the Golan Heights, Turkey\u2019s ongoing skirmishes with Kurdish forces, Russian interests in maintaining influence, and US preemptive strikes to deny weapons caches from remnant ISIS forces, underscore the volatile landscape. Any transition must navigate these external pressures while addressing domestic fissures.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThe nation\u2019s ethnic and sectarian divisions, exacerbated by years of war, require sensitive reconciliation efforts. The abundance of weapons among various factions raises the specter of prolonged violence, as former allies in the fight against the Assad regime may turn on one another. Syria\u2019s infrastructure lies in ruins, and its oil reserves, controlled by Kurdish forces, remain a contentious issue. International aid and investment are essential for rebuilding, but political instability and mistrust could hinder these efforts.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nDespite these challenges, there are reasons for cautious optimism. Rebel leaders have expressed commitments to pluralism and minority rights, signaling a potential departure from the Assad regime\u2019s exclusionary policies. Turkey, despite its complex role in the conflict, sees stability in Syria as a chance to repatriate millions of Syrian refugees. The international community, led by the United Nations, has pledged support for a peaceful transition. Such external engagement, coupled with lessons learned from other post-conflict transitions, could provide a framework for demilitarization, power sharing, and justice.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThe experiences of the Philippines, Libya, and Iraq serve as reminders of the perils and possibilities inherent in regime change. While the fall of Bashar al-Assad is a victory for the Syrian people, the road ahead demands wisdom, resilience, and unity.\nIn the Edsa People Power Revolution, Filipinos found strength in collective action, dismantling martial rule, and reclaiming democracy. Similarly, Syrians now have the opportunity to forge a new identity rooted in inclusivity and justice. The fall of Bashar al-Assad is an opportunity for reinvention, though fraught with risks. The lessons of history caution against complacency. Celebrations must give way to dialogue, and euphoria must be tempered by the hard work of nation-building.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\ndoyromero@gmail.com\nYour subscription could not be saved.

Taken together, however, Pogo evokes the concepts of foreign syndicates, human trafficking, workplaces with oppressive conditions, money laundering, illegal immigration, and the complicity of some Filipino politicians.\nPogos are a national menace on so many fronts. One can look at it from a governance and transparency point of view, human rights, economics, and national security. Indeed, the Pogo phenomenon which first rose during the previous administration, in the guise of stimulating economic activity, has done us great harm and no good.\nAlice Guo, who has been unmasked as Chinese national Guo Hua Ping, has become the personification of the failures of governance that made the rise of Pogos possible in our country.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThe proximity of Pogos to military bases and reports of alleged People\u2019s Liberation Army uniforms in Pogo compounds raise concerns about espionage, amplifying fears of national security breaches that could compromise the country\u2019s defense capabilities.

These actions aim to manipulate how people think, weaken democratic institutions, and challenge the country\u2019s sovereignty, creating a serious threat to the Philippines\u2019 stability.\nThe move to ban Pogos is a crucial step toward helping the Philippines exit the Financial Action Task Force\u2019s grey list. Earlier this year, President Marcos instructed relevant government agencies to address the country\u2019s \u201cgrey listing.\u201d The government has set a deadline to exit the grey list by the start of 2024 after missing the original target of January 2023.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nIn the legislature, Sen.

Only 5 percent of Filipinos say they \u201cwill support\u201d a pro-China candidate, while 23 percent are ambivalent.\nMeanwhile, a Social Weather Stations (SWS) survey conducted in the same month revealed that fighting corruption, job creation, livelihood generation, and financial literacy are the key components that should be central to a senatorial platform in the 2025 elections.\nThe SWS survey also found that nine out of 10 Filipinos (91 percent) agreed that \u201cgovernment officials involved in corruption must be held accountable.\u201d\nThe issue of Pogos has exposed the weaknesses and vulnerabilities of our systems, especially with foreign influence combined with Filipinos posing as leaders who put their interests above all else. Pogos reveal very deep and alarming issues, and these must be addressed right now before they can do more harm.\nElections are a time for people to be heard.

Associated Press\nCAPE TOWN, South Africa \u2014 President Joe Biden is finally making his long-promised visit to Africa this week, attempting to showcase a U.S.-backed railway project in three countries that he has pushed as a new approach in countering some of China\u2019s global influence.\nBiden\u2019s first visit to the continent as president \u2014 which he left to the very end \u2014 will highlight the Lobito Corridor railway redevelopment in Zambia, Congo and Angola. It aims to advance U.S. presence in a region rich in the critical minerals used in batteries for electric vehicles, electronic devices and clean energy technologies.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThat\u2019s a key field for U.S.-China competition and China has a stranglehold on Africa\u2019s critical minerals.\nFEATURED STORIES\nGLOBALNATION\nPCG: China using AIS spoofing to mislead public and stir confusion\nGLOBALNATION\nPH asserts rights over Bajo de Masinloc at UN General Assembly\nGLOBALNATION\n'Aid for Kristine-hit Batangas': Presidential assistance for farmers, fisherfolk, families\nA new strategy\nThe U.S. has for years built relations in Africa through trade, security and humanitarian aid. The 800-mile (1,300-kilometer), $2.5 billion railway upgrade is a different move and has shades of China\u2019s Belt and Road foreign infrastructure strategy that has surged ahead.\nREAD:\nBiden\u2019s promised visit to Africa shows no signs of happening yet\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThe Biden administration has called the corridor one of the president\u2019s signature initiatives.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nBiden starts a three-day trip to Angola on Monday, yet Lobito\u2019s future and any change in the way the United States engages with a continent of 1.4 billion leaning heavily toward China depends on the incoming administration of Donald Trump.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\n\u201cPresident Biden is no longer the story,\u201d said Mvemba Dizolele, the director of the Africa Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington-based think tank. \u201cEven African leaders are focused on Donald Trump.\u201d\nA fit for Trump\u2019s vision?\nThe U.S. has committed hundreds of millions of dollars to the Lobito Corridor alongside financing from the European Union, the Group of Seven leading industrialized nations, a Western-led private consortium and African banks.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\n\u201cA lot is riding on this in terms of its success and its replicability,\u201d said Tom Sheehy, a fellow at the United States Institute of Peace, a nonpartisan federal research institution.\nREAD:\nBiden fetes Kenyan leader as Africa competition grows\nHe called it one of the flagships for the G7\u2019s new Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment, which was driven by Biden and aims to reach other developing nations as a response to China\u2019s Belt and Road.\nBiden promised to visit Africa last year after reviving the U.S.-Africa Summit for the first time in nearly a decade in December 2022. The trip was kicked back to 2024 and delayed again this October because of Hurricane Milton, reinforcing a sentiment among Africans that their continent is still low priority. The last U.S. president to visit was Barack Obama in 2015.\n\u201cAfrica never gets top attention,\u201d said Witney Schniedman, an expert on African economic growth at the nonprofit Brookings Institution.\nBut many are optimistic that the Lobito project, which isn\u2019t due for completion until well after Biden has left office, will survive a change of administration and be given a chance. It goes some way to blunting China, which has bipartisan backing and is high on Trump\u2019s to-do list.\n\u201cAs long as they keep labeling Lobito one of the main anti-China tools in Africa, there is a certain likelihood that it\u2019s going to keep being funded,\u201d said Christian-G\u00e9raud Neema, who analyzes China-Africa relations.\nSome success in Africa\nThe Lobito Corridor will be an upgrade and extension of a railway line from the copper and cobalt mines of northern Zambia and southern Congo to Angola\u2019s Atlantic Ocean port of Lobito, a route west for Africa\u2019s critical minerals.\nIt\u2019s little more than a starting point for the U.S. and its partners, because China is dominant in the mining in Zambia and Congo. Congo has more than 70% of the world\u2019s cobalt, most of which is heading to China to reinforce its critical mineral supply chain that the U.S. and Europe have to rely on.\nLobito was made possible by some American diplomatic success in Angola that led to a Western consortium winning the bid for the project in 2022 ahead of Chinese competition, a surprise given Angola\u2019s long and strong ties with Beijing. China financed a previous redevelopment of the railway.\nThe Biden administration accelerated American outreach to Angola, turning around what was an antagonistic relationship three decades ago when the U.S. armed anti-government rebels in Angola\u2019s civil war. U.S.-Angola trade was $1.77 billion last year, while the U.S. has a stronger stake in regional security through a strategic presence on the Atlantic Ocean, and Angolan President Jo\u00e3o Louren\u00e7o\u2019s role mediating in a conflict in eastern Congo.\nIn Angola, Biden will announce new developments on health, agribusiness, security cooperation as well as the Lobito Corridor, White House officials said on a preview call with reporters.\nThe visit, the first by a sitting U.S. president to Angola, will \u201chighlight that remarkable evolution of the U.S.-Angola relationship,\u201d Frances Brown, a special assistant to the president and senior director for African affairs at the National Security Council, said on a separate call.\nIt will also draw attention to a perennial challenge for America\u2019s value-based diplomacy in Africa. International rights groups have used Biden\u2019s trip to criticize the Louren\u00e7o government\u2019s authoritarian shift. Political opponents have been imprisoned and allegedly tortured, while security and other laws have been passed in Angola that severely restrict freedoms, throwing some scrutiny on Washington\u2019s new African partnership.\nWill the US really show up?\nThose calling for more U.S. presence in Africa say Angola and the Lobito spinoff show what might be achieved, even with China-facing countries, if the U.S. is willing to consistently engage. But they see signs for Africa when China has held a summit with African leaders every three years since 2000, while the US has had just two summits, in 2014 and 2022, and there are no plans for the next one.\nMichelle Gavin, a former U.S. ambassador to Botswana and adviser on Africa to Obama, said that the U.S. had failed to take Africa seriously over multiple administrations, a bipartisan trend. She doesn\u2019t see Biden\u2019s visit and Lobito being a major \u201cinflection point\u201d that will drive a new U.S. focus across Africa.\nYour subscription could not be saved.

Paolo Duterte at the Batasang Pambansa building in Quezon City, the Vice President said she faced mortal danger from the Speaker of the House.\nShe said she told the House sergeant-at-arms, retired police Maj. Gen. Napoleon Taas, that she didn\u2019t need any extra security personnel as she had brought her own.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\n\u201cIf anything happens to me here inside (the House), there is only one person who wants to kill me, and that\u2019s (Speaker) Martin Romualdez,\u201d she said.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nBut she added: \u201cI don\u2019t think he will do that here inside. He will do it outside.\u201d\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nRomualdez on Thursday called out Duterte for sending her officials instead of herself to explain to lawmakers her use of P612.5 million in confidential funds of the OVP and the Department of Education when she was still the education secretary from 2022 to 2023.\n\u201cShe should now appear, take the oath, speak and explain,\u201d Romualdez told reporters in Butuan City on Thursday. \u201cShe shouldn\u2019t let her officials at the OVP and DepEd handle (the explanations).\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nShe should be the one to speak.\u201d\nOvernight stay\nAccording to House officials, Duterte made the move to place herself inside the House on Thursday night, arriving at the Batasang Pambansa in Quezon City around 7:40 p.m. supposedly to visit Lopez, who was cited for contempt and ordered detained a day earlier.\nLopez, 50, who had twice served as Davao City administrator when Duterte was the city mayor, was cited for her \u201cevasive\u201d answers to a House inquiry into the Vice President\u2019s use of confidential funds and for \u201cundue interference\u201d in the House\u2019s oversight function by telling the Commission on Audit (COA) not to hand over audit reports on the funds to the committee looking into the spending of the OVP.\nAfter detention visits ended at 10 p.m. on Thursday, Duterte refused to leave the House and locked herself inside the office of her brother, Davao Rep. Paolo Duterte, where she stayed overnight, according to Taas.\nHouse Secretary General Reginald Velasco said that Duterte and her staff remained in her brother\u2019s office and refused to leave even after they had shut down power, which the House normally does ahead of the long weekend as its offices are closed from Friday to Sunday.\nIn a statement on Friday, Senior Deputy Speaker Aurelio Gonzales Jr., Majority Leader Manuel Jose Dalipe and Deputy Speaker David Suarez denounced Duterte\u2019s brazen disrespect of the chamber and her serious breach of security.\n\u201cNo matter how many times she was asked by our House sergeant-at-arms to leave, she has ignored it,\u201d they said. \u201cIf she does not have respect for simple rules, how can we trust that she is able to respect the bigger responsibilities she must do as an elected public official?\u201d\nManila Rep. Joel Chua, who heads the House committee on good government and accountability investigating Duterte\u2019s alleged misuse of confidential funds as Vice President when she was education secretary, said at a press conference that he had denied Duterte\u2019s request to stay with Lopez inside the House detention facility.\nRequest denied\nIn a Nov. 21 letter to Chua, Vice President Duterte appealed on humanitarian grounds to stay with Lopez, expressing concern for her chief of staff\u2019s health and well-being.\nShe listed down, among others, Lopez\u2019s chronic back problems, nausea, lightheadedness, and fears for her safety.\nChua rejected her request, citing the strict rules of the Office of the Sergeant-at-Arms (Osaa) regarding detention, adding that the facility was exclusively for detainees.\nBut Duterte pressed on, stating in another letter on Friday her intent to visit Lopez daily \u201cfor the full period of her detention\u201d according to the guidelines of the Osaa pertaining to persons under House custody.\nDuring her Zoom press conference, Duterte was asked why she was evading the House probe. She replied that the House was imposing \u201cunconstitutional\u201d rules in its hearings and planned to legally challenge its investigation.\n\u201cThey have no investigatorial, prosecutorial powers, and they must respect the rights of people appearing,\u201d she said.\nThe Vice President said she was consulting her lawyers regarding the possibility of taking the legislators to court and that \u201cthey are ready\u201d to file cases against House members.\nBrother lets her stay\nHer brother informed Chua in a letter that he had given her permission to \u201cstay indefinitely in my office to discharge her day-to-day duties.\u201d\n\u201cThe Vice President\u2019s stay will also correspond to her visits to (Lopez) and other OVP personnel currently detained,\u201d he said, adding that she was \u201camenable\u201d to staying there even without water and electricity.\nThe Vice President told reporters that she could stay in her brother\u2019s office until New Year\u2019s Day.\nChua, sounding exasperated, asked whether \u201cwe need to remind the Vice President to follow the law.\u201d\n\u201cOur Vice President is a lawyer, she is the second-highest official of the land. We took an oath of service which stated that we will follow the rules of the land,\u201d Chua said.\nPlay for sympathy\nOther lawmakers also condemned Duterte\u2019s actions which they said was an attempt to influence the proceedings against her and even curry public sympathy for her as she continued to dodge the hearings into her confidential fund use.\nZambales Rep. Jay Khonghun said he couldn\u2019t help \u201cbut be suspicious of her motives of offering to join her chief of staff in detention,\u201d saying that she might just want to stop Lopez from testifying once the committee resumes its inquiry on Monday.\n\u201cOr is this just for show, another attempt at heroics? \u2026 Is this the Duterte brand?\u201d he asked. \u201cWhy is their behavior bereft of respect? Why act like a brat?\u201d\nACT Teachers Rep. France Castro also questioned Duterte\u2019s \u201cselective appearance\u201d at the House.\n\u201cIf she has nothing to hide, why doesn\u2019t she face us? Her continued absence from our hearings while finding time for other House visits only reinforces public doubt about the use of these funds,\u201d she said.\nDavao origins\nDuterte attended a hearing called by the quad committee on Nov. 13 to show solidarity with her father, former President Rodrigo Duterte, whose brutal drug war was under investigation.\nThis time, she literally stayed in the House to show support for Lopez.\nLopez, a niece of former Mayor Elias Lopez, first entered the Davao City government service as city council secretary in 2007, when Duterte first ran and won as vice mayor in the city.\nWhen Duterte won as mayor in 2010, she picked Lopez as her city administrator.\nLopez gained the reputation of a no-nonsense executive.\nREAD:\nHouse orders transfer of VP Duterte\u2019s aide to women\u2019s prison\nAmong her earliest directives was a dress code at City Hall, where people from the far-flung villages used to be at ease and were welcomed wearing only their slippers when the older Duterte was the city mayor.\nIn 2013, when her father again ran for mayor, Duterte withdrew from politics and went full time into her private legal practice.\nShe again picked Lopez as her city administrator when she won again as mayor and her father became President in 2016.\nYour subscription could not be saved.

        "content": "The recent election of Donald Trump as President of the United States is set to significantly influence the electronics industry, a sector already navigating the complexities of global trade, supply chain management, and technological innovation. As Trump begins his second term, the implications for this vital industry are multifaceted, encompassing trade policies, regulatory changes, and shifts in international relations, particularly with China.\nTrade policies and tariffs. One of the most immediate impacts of Trump\u2019s presidency on the electronics industry will likely stem from his approach to trade. During his first term, Trump implemented a series of tariffs aimed at reducing the trade deficit and protecting American manufacturing. These tariffs, particularly on Chinese imports, have already reshaped the landscape for electronics manufacturers.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nIn his second term, Trump has proposed even more aggressive tariffs, including a potential 60-percent tariff on all goods from China. Such measures could drastically increase costs for electronics companies that rely on Chinese manufacturing for components and finished products. The Consumer Technology Association has warned that these tariffs could lead to significant price increases for consumers, with estimates suggesting that laptop prices could nearly double and smartphones could see a 26-percent increase. This scenario poses a substantial risk to consumer electronics affordability and could dampen overall market demand.\nFEATURED STORIES\nOPINION\nUrgent action needed vs online piracy as Congress session nears end\nOPINION\nLife has shortened\nOPINION\nThe gift of second chances\nSupply chain disruptions. The electronics industry is characterized by complex global supply chains that depend on the seamless flow of components across borders. The potential for heightened tariffs may force manufacturers to seek alternative suppliers or relocate production, which could disrupt established relationships and increase operational costs.\nAs companies navigate these challenges, they may also face delays in production and delivery, further complicating their ability to meet consumer demand. The uncertainty surrounding trade policies could lead to a more cautious approach to investment in new technologies and product development, as companies weigh the risks of potential tariff impacts against the need for innovation.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nRegulatory environment and innovation. Trump\u2019s administration has historically favored deregulation, which could have mixed implications for the electronics industry. On one hand, reduced regulatory burdens may foster innovation and allow companies to operate more freely. However, this approach could also lead to a lack of oversight in critical areas such as data privacy and cybersecurity, raising concerns among consumers and advocacy groups.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThe electronics sector, particularly in areas like artificial intelligence and data management, may experience a shift in regulatory focus. Trump\u2019s administration has indicated a desire to dismantle existing frameworks that govern technology development, potentially leading to a more laissez-faire environment. While this could spur rapid advancements in certain technologies, it may also create risks related to consumer protection and ethical considerations.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThe future of the CHIPS Act. The CHIPS and Science Act, passed during the Biden administration, aims to bolster the US semiconductor manufacturing and reduce reliance on foreign supply chains. During his campaign, Trump criticized the CHIPS Act, labeling it as \u201cso bad\u201d and suggesting that tariffs would be more effective for manufacturing than the funding provided by the act.\nWhile some experts express concern about potential repeal efforts, others believe that Trump may recognize the bipartisan support for the CHIPS Act and its importance for American manufacturing. The semiconductor industry has seen significant investments due to the act, particularly in states like Arizona, where companies like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Limited and Intel are expanding operations. If Trump chooses to modify rather than repeal the CHIPS Act, there may be opportunities to streamline funding processes or expand the scope of the Act to include energy generation, given the high energy demands of semiconductor manufacturing. This could lead to a more robust framework that supports both semiconductor production and sustainable energy initiatives.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThe projected impact of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency on the electronics industry is complex and multifaceted. His proposed trade policies, particularly aggressive tariffs, could lead to significant price increases for consumers and disrupt established supply chains. While deregulation may foster innovation, it also raises concerns about consumer protection and ethical considerations.\nAs the industry navigates these challenges, companies will need to remain agile and responsive to the evolving landscape. The ability to adapt to changing trade dynamics, regulatory environments, and consumer preferences will be crucial for success in an increasingly competitive and uncertain world. The future of the electronics industry will depend on how well it can balance the pressures of cost, innovation, and ethical responsibility in the face of a shifting political landscape.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\nArthur Tan was president of Ayala chipmaker, IMI for 23 years.

        "content": "I saw many posts online about Dominican Fr. Gustavo Guti\u00e9rrez, proudly Peruvian, popularly known as one of the fathers of liberation theology, who died on Oct. 22 at the age of 96. I thought, why don\u2019t I post mine, too, my one-on-one interview with him in 2000, the turn of the century, when he visited the Philippines. He was 72 then. Someone like him might not come this way again when the world is in a mess, politically, environmentally, culturally and the so-called happiness index in some parts has plummeted.\nThe influence of this man\u2019s revolutionary ideas, of his life as a priest, theologian, and action man went beyond the Catholic Church. Who was Guti\u00e9rrez that grassroots development workers both in the church and secular setting were so inspired by him?\nFirst let me say that community organizing among the poor and oppressed had four key influences: theology of liberation for which Guti\u00e9rrez was known, Saul Alinsky (conflict resolution), Paulo Freire (pedagogy of the oppressed and Marxist analysis).\nArticle continues after this advertisement\n\u201cPoverty is the first violence,\u201d he said to me. I was dumbstruck. Suddenly the word \u201cpoor\u201d took on a new nuance especially because he kept referring to them as \u201cthe last ones.\u201d But wait. He also spoke about poverty as a way of life that could be embraced, not only by those in the so-called consecrated life but also by those of us right smack in the heart of a messy, consumerist world. Here goes:\nFEATURED STORIES\nOPINION\nUrgent action needed vs online piracy as Congress session nears end\nOPINION\nLife has shortened\nOPINION\nThe gift of second chances\n\u201cPoverty is an act of love and liberation. It has a redemptive value. If the ultimate cause of human exploitation and alienation is selfishness, the deepest reason for voluntary poverty is love of neighbor. Christian poverty has meaning only as a commitment of solidarity with the poor who suffer misery and injustice. The commitment is to witness to the evil which has resulted from the sin and is a breach of communion.\n\u201cIt is not a question of idealizing poverty, but rather of taking it on as it is\u2014an evil\u2014to protest against it and to struggle to avoid it \u2026 It is poverty lived not for its own sake, but rather as an authentic imitation of Christ, it is poverty which means taking on the sinful human condition to liberate humankind from sin and all its consequences.\u201d\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nHe defined theology as \u201ca way to speak on God, a language of God\u201d and that liberation theology is \u201cnot a sociological or economic program\u201d but something that addresses the consciousness in order to change it. The consequence of this is solidarity with the poor and helping them to not accept poverty as fate.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nMy take from left field: In this 21st-century landscape and in speaking of the poor, let us stop idealizing \u201cFilipino resilience\u201d as the gold standard of virtues.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nFor those squeamish about liberation theology because it had been wrongly associated with Marxism, Guti\u00e9rrez said that \u201cpeople today are in a better position to understand our theology.\u201d There was never any mention of armed struggled in his writings, he stressed. \u201cWe have affirmed this and the Latin American bishops have affirmed his. It is not a justification for any other violence.\u201d So, comprende?\nBut, indeed, there was a time when some church elements misunderstood liberation theology. Even a United States report did say that liberation theology was dangerous to US foreign policy. This twisted thinking must have had a bearing on the killings of priests and nuns by right-wing military regimes.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThe major source of liberation theology is the Bible, Gutierrez reminded. \u201cIt is the effort of liberation theology to read the Bible from the concrete situation of poor persons.\u201d My sneaky retort: \u201cAre top guys in the church not reading it that way?\u201d He singled out models who got it right: the assassinated bishop of El Salvador \u00d3scar Romero (now a canonized saint) and Brazil\u2019s Dom H\u00e9lder C\u00e2mara.\nThe Bible, he said, is not to be read the way we read a beautiful book but from the point of the poor of history. We miss out on this, he said, because we tend to think of religion as without so many requirements. \u201cWe like a quiet religion,\u201d he added, \u201cthat revolved around our little lives,\u201d when, in fact, the whole view of the Bible is from the point of view of those who are considered the last, the insignificant (\u201cinsinyeeficant,\u201d he would say) because of class, color, gender, culture. (In our context, it is ang mga nasa laylayan ng lipunan.)\nWhat does his priesthood mean to him? \u201cService of God and the poor,\u201d he replied. \u201cIt is one way, not the only way. It is not necessarily better, it is \u201cdee-ferrrent.\u201d Better depends on the quality of commitment, \u201cnot on my status as a priest.\u201d\nDid he have favorite biblical figures, the great prophets perhaps who railed against oppressors? He had many, he said, but this time he singled out the Book of Job in the Old Testament to stress a point. It is about justice and \u201cthe gratuitous love of God.\u201d Matthew 25, too, he added. The heart-stopping last portion, methinks. Read it.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nYour subscription could not be saved.

        "content": "AFP file photos\nAfter an election period filled with twists and turns\u2013from assassination attempts, debate disasters to replacement candidates\u2014it all boils down to this day: November 5, Election Day in the United States.\nThis year\u2019s US presidential race between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump is shaping up to be one of the closest in the powerful country\u2019s history.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThe race is so close that latest polls show that Harris and Trump remain deadlocked within margins of error in the seven so-called swing states that may very well dictate who will become the next president of the United States.\nFEATURED STORIES\nGLOBALNATION\nPCG: China using AIS spoofing to mislead public and stir confusion\nGLOBALNATION\nPH asserts rights over Bajo de Masinloc at UN General Assembly\nGLOBALNATION\n'Aid for Kristine-hit Batangas': Presidential assistance for farmers, fisherfolk, families\nThis brings us to a country hundreds of kilometers away from the US: The Philippines, a strong military ally of the powerful nation. Should we care about how the US election is shaping up?\nThe answer, and perhaps the safest answer: We should, at least, monitor it.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nA military ally in the West Philippine Sea\nThe United States is one of the allies\u2013if not the primary ally\u2013of the Philippines in our fight for sovereignty in the West Philippine Sea.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nDue to recent aggression by China against Philippine vessels in West Philippine Sea, proposals to invoke the Mutual Defense Treaty (MDT) between Manila and Washington have grown louder.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThe MDT is a 73-year old military agreement between Manila and Washington which calls for each other\u2019s defense in case of an armed attack\u2013including in the West Philippine Sea.\n\u201cThe US election will certainly impact the geopolitical fate of two allied states on how they will address issues on asymmetrical trade and security in the Indo-Pacific region,\u201d Dr. Chester Cabalza, president and founder of Manila-based think tank International Development and Security Cooperation, told INQUIRER.net.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThe MDT, however, is not the only military agreement the Philippines has with the US.\nThis year alone, four new locations were identified as additional sites for the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (Edca), not to mention the annual military exercises and joint patrols between Manila and Washington in Philippine waters.\nEdca allows the US to rotate troops in the Philippines for extended stays and the US to build and operate facilities on Philippine bases for both American and Philippine forces.\nAccording to Cabalza, a leadership change in the US may be a \u201cboon and bane\u201d for Philippines security, especially with standing agreements the two countries have.\n\u201cAs a friend of the US, Filipinos should see the electoral change in the White House as a boon and bane if Washington will fulfill its treaty obligations with Manila as both countries mutually expanded naval and aerial bases in northern and western parts of the Philippines,\u201d Cabalza said.\nSo when the election is over, what will happen to the Philippines?\nA Harris win may simply mean a continuation of the working relationship between Manila and Washington, taking off from the relationship between the administration of President Bongbong Marcos and the administration of US President Joe Biden.\nIn September 2023, Marcos and Harris met on the sidelines of the 43rd Association of Southeast Asian Nations Summit in Jakarta where among the issues they discussed was the West Philippine Sea. During their meeting, Harris reaffirmed the US\u2019 ironclad commitment to the Philippines.\nThe doubts, however, arise from a possible Trump win.\nCabalza said he fears that Trump may lessen his focus on the West Philippine Sea and direct it to other conflicts in other parts of the globe.\n\u201cWith Trump\u2019s triumph, he may compartmentalize his foreign policy and lessen his focus on the West Philippine Sea as he will give more importance to current wars in Ukraine and Gaza,\u201d Cabalza said.\n\u201cHis comeback will also change the contours and the security landscape in the region as he may halt the defense developments in the Edca sites,\u201d he added.\nGeopolitical analyst and De La Salle University Department of International Studies lecturer Don McLain Gill pointed out that during Trump\u2019s term as president of the US, there were also attempts to strengthen Washington\u2019s relationship with Manila.\nHowever, then Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte pivoted towards China and gave cold shoulder treatment to the US, not allowing the Philippines to maximize its negotiations with the Trump administration.\n\u201cThe Trump administration also rejected a huge percentage of China\u2019s expansionist claims over the South China Sea and the West Philippine Sea, in particular. In that regard, we could see how the Philippine-US alliance was significant,\u201d Gill told INQUIRER.net.\nGill, however, noted the stark difference between the foreign policy of Duterte, who aligned himself with China, and Marcos, who was more open to working with the US.\n\u201cWith Marcos Jr. however, I see a foreign policy that positions the Philippines as a proactive hub for like-minded cooperation as well as the Philippines\u2019 position in wanting to be a more proactive stakeholder in the rules-based order of the Indo-Pacific. I think that converges well with the Trump administration,\u201d Gill added.\nNonetheless, Gill stressed that there are still concerns over a Trump re-election, especially with the \u201cnegotiation-driven approach\u201d of the former US president.\nWill Manila still be a priority for Trump?\nGill said he believes that the Indo-Pacific region will still be a \u201cclear\u201d priority for Trump, given the escalating tension between the US and China.\n\u201cThis would rely on Manila\u2019s ability to present itself as an important stakeholder and important element in the Indo-Pacific geopolitics because we are a frontliner state. We are acutely affected by the US-China power competition. It\u2019s up to how we are able to convey that message to a Trump administration,\u201d Gill said.\n\u201cWe cannot just expect without making more of an effort in the negotiations and dialogues with the US as well,\u201d he added.\nFor now, only time can tell what will happen with US-Philippines ties should Trump win, although it is important to note that Philippine Ambassador to the United States Jose Manuel Romualdez stressed that the MDT will remain unchanged, regardless of who becomes the next US president.\nRomualdez said that while a Trump comeback could bring shifts in economic policy, the defense relations between Manila and Washington would remain intact.\nFilipinos in the US\nWhile results of the US elections may not directly impact Filipinos here in the Philippines, these could affect millions of Filipinos residing in the States.\nAs of 2022, there are about 4.1 million Filipino-Americans living in the US, according to data from the US Census Bureau.\nImmigration is one of the issues at the forefront of the US presidential elections.\nA Pew Research Center report states that about 61 percent of US voters say immigration is very important to their vote. This figure is a 9 percentage point increase from the 2020 presidential election.\nHarris is pushing for comprehensive immigration reforms, such as providing pathways to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.\nThe vice president also said in a visit to Arizona in September that anyone crossing the border illegally would be barred from seeking asylum in the US. But \u201chard-working migrants\u201d who come to the US legally should be given a pathway to citizenship, she said.\nIf there\u2019s one issue that has served as a cornerstone of the Trump campaign, it is immigration.\nIf he is successful in staging a comeback to the White House, Trump intends to initiate what he calls as the \u201cbiggest domestic deportation operation in US history.\u201d\nThe proposal will affect millions of undocumented individuals in the US, including undocumented Filipinos.\nIn 2017, the Philippine government prepared for the deportation of some 10,000 Filipinos who may be evicted from the US after the Trump administration rescinds a program that allows undocumented immigrant children to stay legally there.\nTrump\u2019s immigration policy may also limit opportunities for Filipinos who wish to try their luck in the US.\n\u201c[This could affect] those who want to pursue a career path or education in the US. With immigration tighter or new immigration policies or longer bureaucratic processes could significantly impact the social aspect of the people-to-people relationship between the US and the Philippines,\u201d Gill said.\nFor context, an INQUIRER.net report states that in 2022, the Philippines ranked as one of the leading countries of origin for immigrants to the United States, representing a notable four percent of the total immigrant population.\nUS-China\u2026 and the Philippines\nRegardless of who wins the US presidential elections, the power struggle between the US and China will continue\u2013and caught in the middle is the Philippines.\n\u201cThe US remains as the strongest state in hard and soft powers that\u2019s why the Philippines and the world have strategic interests in its current election,\u201d Cabalza said.\nAccording to Cabalza, the election of a new US leader will affect global geopolitics and economy, as well as whether the US will maintain its superpower role in the world, especially with the rising threat of China.\n\u201cIt matters to all of us, as the world order may see sudden alteration under the new leader of the US,\u201d Cabalza said.\nThe fact is, whatever happens between the US and China will have an impact on other countries, but more so on the Philippines which is geographically near China.\nGeopolitically speaking, the Philippines is also at the intersection of the traditional sphere of US influence and the emergence of China\u2019s power projection, according to Gill. Thus, a radical change in the global power structure will have an impact on the Philippines.\nGill explained that China\u2019s challenges and expansionist ambitions in the West Philippine Sea have become an \u201cexistential threat\u201d to the Philippines, which relies on the US as a security partner.\n\u201cIf the US would decrease its involvement, that could be a problem for our overarching foreign policy security calculations given that the US is our traditional security provider and traditional ally,\u201d Gill said.\nShould China also challenge the US over Taiwan, the northern part of the Philippines, which is only a few nautical miles away from Taiwan, will also be immediately affected.\nThis concern is on top of the more than 200,000 overseas Filipino workers in Taiwan, Gill added.\nThis brings us back to a question in this long and arduous journey: Should the Philippines care about what\u2019s happening in the US?\nYour subscription could not be saved.

        "content": "Indonesia\u2014Since their invention in the early 20th century, plastics have been omnipresent in our daily life, and have become a global choice due to their durability, flexibility, and low production cost. Industries ranging from food to electronics have been relying for decades on plastics, their primary material for product packaging. Plastic serves as protection, marketing and information tool, and a convenient way to transport products. For optimal performance, plastic is often combined with other materials, making it difficult to recycle.\nDespite the ample benefits, plastic\u2019s versatility may pose risks to health and the environment. Since the 1950s, plastic consumption has surged, reaching 400.3 million tons in global production in 2022 alone, much of them for single-use packaging to preserve food and protect fragile items.\nBut environmental alarms are sounding. Researcher Hannah Ritchie and colleagues estimate that 0.5 percent of plastics end up in the ocean, harming marine ecosystems. Traces of plastic also pollute mountains, forests, and waterways.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nTo deal with the problem, businesses and governments have been showing a stronger commitment. The fifth Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee (INC-5) on Plastic Pollution from Nov. 25 to Dec. 1 in Busan, South Korea, was meant to draft an international legally binding instrument to tackle the plastic pollution problem.\nFEATURED STORIES\nOPINION\nUrgent action needed vs online piracy as Congress session nears end\nOPINION\nLife has shortened\nOPINION\nThe gift of second chances\nThe momentum is building as over 260 businesses, from multinationals to local enterprises, have joined the Business Coalition for a Global Plastics Treaty (BCGPT), urging governments at INC-5 to adopt an ambitious, full-lifecycle plastics treaty. This collective effort also aims to foster awareness, innovation, and a sustainable ecosystem with the prospect of global regulations under a treaty.\nIndustry has also been exploring solutions like optimizing and harmonizing packaging (Reduce), reusable packaging, and design for recycling. It has also been increasing recycled content along with developing bioplastics and paper-based options to reduce virgin plastic use. These innovations require comprehensive life cycle assessments and suitable waste management for bio-based plastics to ensure sustainable impact.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nAs well, food and beverage packaging must meet strict safety and compliance standards to protect consumers. Key guidelines include Food and Drug Monitoring Agency Regulation No. 20/2019, and international standards like those from the United States Food and Drug Administration, the European Medicines Agency, and the European Food Safety Authority, detailing permitted, limited, and banned substances. Additionally, packaging should be environmentally safe, functional, competitively priced, and of high quality.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nLeading producers of fast-moving consumer goods have also optimized packaging size, increased recycled content and used easier-to-recycle materials. They\u2019ve introduced reusable designs and innovations as well, like paper straws.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nBut are these alternatives enough to address the plastic crisis?\nRecycling is important, but not enough. In fact, less than 10 percent of plastic waste is currently recycled globally. The remaining waste often ends up being incinerated in landfills.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThen there\u2019s the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) program, which requires companies to manage their products\u2019 end-of-life, which is now gaining traction, especially in developed countries with advanced waste management. However, for EPR to be effective globally, stronger waste management systems are essential, particularly in developing countries where they remain inadequate and poorly managed, leading to high rates of plastic leakage into rivers and oceans.\nI\u2019d strongly suggest maximizing our efforts for waste collection, waste segregation, and building the infrastructure to process related waste. We must ensure greater quantity and better quality feedstock for secondary raw materials to increase the recycling rate and recycled content. For packaging, we can work on nonfood contact material if the food contact material is not yet available.\nWe also need stricter but more conducive regulations to prevent plastic leakage and to promote and encourage the use of sustainable materials, given the higher costs incurred when industry switches to easy-to-recycle materials or to recycled-content materials. Waste management systems should not create new problems, such as improper disposal of hazardous byproducts.\nThe plastic crisis requires multiple solutions. Global rules can unify multi-stakeholder efforts to phase out problematic plastics, but consumer behavior change is also essential. Now is the time to advocate for stronger regulations, better waste management, and a collective shift in consumption and production. Plastics were considered a \u201cmiracle\u201d when they were first introduced for packaging. They now pose challenges and are perceived as a symbol of unsustainability.\nIt is time to rethink our relationship with plastics for the sake of the planet.

        "content": "South Korea is a very neat and clean country, but in public spaces, trash cans are few and far between. Soon after our arrival in 2023, when I noticed this, I was told why: it\u2019s a holdover from the pro-democracy riots of the 1980s, when students would hurl trash cans at the police.\nThere is an undercurrent of toughness, even confrontation, in the politics of the Republic of Korea. Our introduction to this came by way of the Korean medical system when, in February last year, the government announced it would increase the number of slots for admission to medical schools. The medical profession erupted in outrage, residents and interns walked out, and even as professors had to scramble to fill in the gap, the profession as a whole supported the strike. The government reacted with increasing fury, at one point threatening to draft the striking residents and interns into the army to force them to go back to their posts. Public opinion was vehemently opposed to the strike, which was perceived to be merely in support of maintaining the wealth and status of doctors, in a society that has one of the lowest doctor-per-capita ratios in the developed world.\nThe strike continues to this day; in the hospital, our family visits, oncology has ceased admitting new patients, and waiting times for many services are long. What this suggested to me was that public opinion can be ignored, even flouted, by a committed, even selfish, minority, when the stakes are high enough\u2014and the institutions, even when supported by public opinion, can be thwarted as a result.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nFor all his protestations to the contrary\u2014it was symbolic, he said\u2014President Yoon Suk-yeol of South Korea was serious about martial law. But he, as he himself claimed in his speech announcing his surprise move, felt his back was to the wall because his Cabinet kept being impeached, his budget was being slashed, his wife was facing perpetual investigations, so that he felt incapable of governing: not least, though he didn\u2019t mention it, because his party had lost the midterms, reducing him to the status of a lame duck president. Observers would later point out that part of the reason the confrontation between the President and the opposition was so ferocious is that the leader of the opposition himself faces multiple investigations and that a snap presidential election would enable that leader, Lee Jae-myung, to avoid electoral disqualification.\nFEATURED STORIES\nOPINION\nUrgent action needed vs online piracy as Congress session nears end\nOPINION\nLife has shortened\nOPINION\nThe gift of second chances\nThe problem (for Yoon, as it turned out) was he was up against a society and even a political system allergic to the idea of emergency rule. Our Supreme Court likes to quote the old maxim that \u201cwhen the guns speak, the law falls silent,\u201d and any martial law worthy of the name requires not just meticulous planning, but ruthless execution by an emboldened military.\nTwo stories best illustrate the military response to being ordered to shut down the legislature and lock up lawmakers, take over the media, and pursue a conspiracy theory alleging the opposition rigged the midterms that the ruling party lost. The special forces supposed to chopper into the National Assembly were delayed 40 minutes because they had to wait for permission to enter a no-fly zone because the Air Force didn\u2019t know martial law was going on. The delay party explains how assemblymen got the chance to hold an emergency session that voted down martial law; soldiers sent to raid the National Election Commission \u201call took a long walk or had instant ramen at convenience stores, then sauntered back after martial law was lifted.\u201d\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nA British news report put it best: martial law, it said, lasted half an hour longer than the film \u201cParasite.\u201d Having not only failed, but spectacularly so, it seemed impossible for President Yoon to avoid impeachment. But he did, for reasons similar to the success of the Korean doctors: stubborn discipline born of self-interest.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThe Korean Constitution requires a two-thirds majority or 200 out of 300 assemblymen, to impeach. The President\u2019s party, though diminished, retains 108 seats\u2013eight more than is needed to deny the passage of an impeachment motion. If party disciple would hold, then impeachment would fail\u2014over and over. On the day of the impeachment vote, he dangled an offer his party couldn\u2019t refuse: he would, he said, recede from governance and share it with his party. But he would remain in office.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nGaleazzo Ciano, Benito Mussolini\u2019s son-in-law and foreign minister, famously observed, \u201cVictory has a hundred fathers but defeat is an orphan.\u201d For the President\u2019s party, the last time impeachment happened, the then ruling party helped throw their leader overboard\u2014and themselves got massacred in the next election. The lesson then is a ruling party gains nothing by joining an impeachment bandwagon: as one administration lawmaker, Yun Sang-hyeon bluntly puts it: \u201cWe are getting criticized now, but people forget quickly. We saw it after the Park Geun-hye impeachment. Give it a year and they will vote for us again.\u201d They would deny the opposition a victory, and still manage to hold on to power. But Yoon would have to go.\n(To be continued)\nArticle continues after this advertisement\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\nEmail: mlquezon3@gmail.com; Twitter: @mlq3\nYour subscription could not be saved.

Instead, it is focused on understanding the underlying dynamics that drive voter behavior and the ways in which political leaders, like marketers, can (truly) connect with their audiences on an emotional level. The goal is not to support or criticize any particular leader, rather, to examine how certain strategies resonate with voters and, by extension, consumers. Also, we are disclosing that we didn\u2019t vote for Rodrigo Duterte in 2016.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThere have been comparisons on the political strategies of President-elect Donald Trump and former President Duterte. Marketers (and political strategists) are well-aware of the importance of understanding consumer (or voter) behavior or preferences, and finding the best way to communicate and connect with people on a level that translates to sales or, in this case, votes.\nFEATURED STORIES\nBUSINESS\nMore foreign brands seen coming to PH shores in 2025\nBUSINESS\nGlobal Dominion: Simplifying financing to empower every Filipino\nBUSINESS\nInternational group kicks off infrastructure investment drive for PH\nREAD:\n\u2018Retaliate\u2019: Trump tariff talk spurs global jitters, preparations\nDespite perceived and real flaws of imperfect leaders, the winning strategy consistently has been to tap on emotions and frustrations of many voters, especially those who felt they have been ignored by the government. By understanding and amplifying these emotions, which could be very specific and personal, they were able to craft messages that resonated with supporters in a way that most traditional politicians could not. For example, Duterte took a hardline stance on eradicating corruption, crime and drugs, even stating that he wouldn\u2019t hesitate to kill criminals. Other presidential bets focused instead on discipline, governance and unity, with the promise of achieving progress and stability.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nAt the heart of strategizing lies the concept of sensemaking, the process by which people make sense of their world, especially when things feel uncertain or chaotic. In this context, voters were not just responding to policies or speeches; they were looking for ways to claim their place in a diverse and divided society. And marketers can learn a lot from how Trump and Duterte helped people navigate these complex feelings and make tradeoff decisions based on emotional and psychological drivers.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nSensemaking: Why voters choose the \u2018package deal\u2019\nOne of the clear takeaways is that voters do not always make decisions based on facts or logic alone. Often, they make tradeoff decisions, choosing a package of values, emotions and promises that make sense to them within their broader worldview. In a world full of conflicting messages and options, this sensemaking process becomes critical.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nWhen CNN asked, \u201cHas Donald Trump changed America or revealed it?\u201d\u2014the question was not just about whether he created new divides\u2014it was about whether he exposed the deep-seated divisions that had already existed. Trump did not create the issues around economic inequality, cultural tensions, or political polarization, but his rise to power helped people see these tensions more clearly. Similarly, Duterte did not invent the frustrations of Filipinos, but he gave voice to them, allowing voters to make sense of their own anger and disappointment.\nREAD:\nTrump vows to slap 25% tariffs on Mexico, Canada, 10% tariffs on China\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nFor marketers, this is a key lesson: consumers, like voters, do not always make decisions in a straightforward, logical way. Often, consumers have irrational tendencies, and emotions are not easy to decipher. How emotions are triggered depends on each person\u2019s experience, and the meanings placed on the messaging are constructed differently. People then learn to navigate a world of tradeoffs to save on time and resources instead of trying to reach a \u201cperfect\u201d decision. In behavioral economics, the term is \u201csatisficing,\u201d or making decisions based on what is \u201cgood enough\u201d\u2014to make sense of conflicting desires and values that different candidates offer. Understanding this process can help brands craft messages that hit (or nudge) the dominant heart strings to help consumers make decisions faster and more efficiently.\nPeople want a \u2018package\u2019 they can relate to\nWhen voters supported Trump or Duterte, they were not just supporting one issue or one policy; they were supporting a larger vision. A package deal \u201csatisfices\u201d or allows people not just to make tradeoffs but makes it easier to accept imperfections as long as the overall message aligns with their view.\nFor example, Trump\u2019s slogan \u201cMake America great again (Maga)\u201d was not about agreeing with every policy or speech he made. It was a promise that resonated with people who felt that he was the best candidate who could improve the economy. Duterte\u2019s focus on \u201claw and order\u201d appealed to Filipinos who felt he was the best candidate to fight crime and corruption. These slogans framed a broader narrative about restoring what was perceived to be lost, giving voters a clear sense of what they were fighting for, who or what to blame\u2014even if not everything about the leaders\u2019 methods was ideal.\nIn marketing, this lesson is just as important. People are looking for brands that represent something bigger than just a product. They want to feel like the brand aligns with their identity, values and emotions. Successful brands know how to package their messages in a way that speaks to these deeper desires, even if not every feature is perfect.\nThe power of emotional appeals\nBoth Trump and Duterte knew that emotions drive people\u2019s decisions more than cold, hard facts. Whether it was fear, anger, frustration or hope, these leaders tapped into powerful emotional currents to connect with their base. Trump, with his Maga slogan, appealed to fear of cultural, economic and political decline, with threats from illegal immigrants, changing social norms and globalism. On the other hand, Duterte\u2019s use of profane language was consistent with his tough-talking persona that appealed to underdogs, and served to reinforce his promise to restore order in a country struggling with the drug trade and rampant crime. These emotional appeals did not just reflect people\u2019s feelings\u2014they amplified them, providing voters a simpler way to make sense of their anxieties and frustrations.\nFor marketers, emotion is a tool that can drive purchasing decisions more effectively than any product feature or technical specification. By understanding the emotional triggers that influence consumer behavior\u2014such as fear of missing out, a desire for security, or a sense of pride\u2014brands can craft messages accordingly.\n\u2014CONTRIBUTED&nbsp;\nTo be concluded on Dec. 6\nYour subscription could not be saved.

Her campaign cochair, Cedric Richmond, briefly addressed the crowd after midnight, saying Harris would speak publicly later on Wednesday.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\n\u201cWe still have votes to count,\u201d he said.\nRepublicans won a US Senate majority, but neither party appeared to have an edge in the fight for control of the House of Representatives where Republicans currently hold a narrow majority.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nJobs and economy\nVoters identified jobs and the economy as the country\u2019s most pressing problem, according to Reuters/Ipsos opinion polls. Many Americans remained frustrated by higher prices even amid record-high stock markets, fast-growing wages and low unemployment. With the administration of President Joe Biden taking much of the blame, a majority of voters said they trusted Trump more than Harris to address the issue.\nHispanics, traditionally Democratic voters, and lower-income households hit hardest by inflation helped fuel Trump\u2019s election victory. His loyal base of rural, white and noncollege educated voters again showed up in force.\nTrump prevailed despite persistently low approval ratings. Impeached twice, he has been criminally indicted four times and found civilly liable for sexual abuse and defamation. In May, Trump was convicted by a New York jury of falsifying business records to cover up hush money payments to porn star Stormy Daniels.\nCases grinding to a halt\nTrump\u2019s victory will essentially end the criminal cases brought against him, at least for the four years he occupies the White House.\nWhile he as president will have the authority to fire US Special Counsel Jack Smith and shut down the federal cases against him, he will not have the same control over the New York hush money case or Georgia\u2019s prosecution of him for trying to overturn his 2020 loss in that state.\nBut his unique role as president makes it unlikely he will face legal consequences in either case during his term in office.\nOne more court date is scheduled before he is due to be sworn in on Jan. 20, though legal experts said that was unlikely to go forward.\nMajor implications\nHis victory will have major implications for US trade and climate change policies, the war in Ukraine, Americans\u2019 taxes and immigration.\nHis tariff proposals could spark a fiercer trade war with China and US allies, while his pledges to reduce corporate taxes and implement a spate of new cuts could balloon US debt, economists say.\nTrump has promised to launch a mass deportation campaign targeting immigrants in the country illegally.\nHe has said he wants the authority to fire civil servants he views as disloyal. His opponents fear he will turn the Justice Department and other federal law enforcement agencies into political weapons to investigate perceived enemies.\nA second Trump presidency could drive a bigger wedge between Democrats and Republicans on issues such as race, gender, what and how children are taught, and reproductive rights.\nHarris falls short\nVice President Harris fell short in her 15-week sprint as a candidate, failing to galvanize enough support to defeat Trump, who occupied the White House from 2017-2021, or to allay voters\u2019 concerns about the economy and immigration.\nHarris had warned that Trump wanted unchecked presidential power and posed a danger to democracy.\nNearly three-quarters of voters say American democracy is under threat, according to Edison Research exit polls, underscoring the polarization in a nation where divisions have only grown starker during a fiercely competitive race.\nTrump ran a campaign characterized by apocalyptic language. He called the United States a \u201cgarbage can\u201d for immigrants, pledged to save the economy from \u201cobliteration\u201d and cast some rivals as the \u201cenemy within.\u201d\nHis diatribes were often aimed at migrants, who he said were \u201cpoisoning the blood of the country,\u201d or Harris, whom he frequently derided as unintelligent.\nDespite legal woes and controversies, Trump is only the second former president to win a second term after leaving the White House. The first was Grover Cleveland, who served two four-year terms starting in 1885 and 1893.\nUnprecedented campaign\nIn July, a would-be assassin\u2019s bullet grazed his right ear during a campaign rally, exacerbating fears about political violence. Another assassination attempt was thwarted in September at his Florida golf course. Trump blamed both attempts on what he claimed was the heated rhetoric of Democrats including Harris.\nBarely eight days after the July shooting, Biden, 81, dropped out of the race, finally bowing to weeks of pressure from his fellow Democrats after a poor performance during his debate with Trump called into question his mental acuity and the viability of his reelection bid.\nBiden\u2019s decision to step aside turned the contest into a sprint, as Harris raced to mount her own campaign in a matter of weeks, rather than the typical months. Her rise to the top of the ticket reenergized despondent Democrats, and she raised more than $1 billion in less than three months while erasing what had been a solid Trump lead in opinion polls.\nHarris\u2019 financial advantage was partly countered by the intervention of the world\u2019s richest man, Elon Musk, who poured more than $100 million into a super PAC mobilizing Trump voters and used his social media site X to amplify pro-Trump messaging.\nAs the campaign drew to a close, Harris increasingly focused on warning Americans about the perils of reelecting Trump and offered an olive branch to disaffected Republicans.\nShe highlighted remarks from several former Trump officials, including his former chief of staff and retired Marine Corps Gen. John Kelly, who described Trump as a \u201cfascist.\u201d\nTrump\u2019s victory will broaden the fissures in American society, given his false claims of election fraud, anti-immigrant rhetoric and demonization of his political opponents, said Alan Abramowitz, a political science professor at Emory University who studies voter behavior and party politics.\nA second term\nTrump has vowed to reshape the executive branch, including firing civil servants he views as disloyal and using federal law enforcement agencies to investigate his political enemies, violating what has been a long-standing policy of keeping such agencies independent.\nDuring his first term, Trump\u2019s most extreme demands were sometimes stymied by his own Cabinet members, most notably when Vice President Mike Pence refused to block Congress from accepting the 2020 election results.\nYour subscription could not be saved.

(Bradley Collyer/PA via AP)\nTyson Fury looked as stunned as everyone else inside Wembley Stadium after witnessing Daniel Dubois dismantle Anthony Joshua in the latest shake-up of boxing\u2019s heavyweight division.\nExcept Fury had other things on his mind.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\n\u201cListen, that\u2019s cost me 150 million,\u201d Fury, scratching his head, shouted to a friend at ringside on Saturday night.\nFEATURED STORIES\nSPORTS\nLeo Austria returns as coach, Beermen immediately rediscover form\nSPORTS\nPBA: Leo Austria back as San Miguel head coach\nSPORTS\nPBA: Ginebra crushes Phoenix for back to back wins\nREAD: \u2018Warrior\u2019 Anthony Joshua vows to fight on despite Dubois mauling\nMaybe Fury vs. Joshua \u2014 the long-awaited heavyweight fight that boxing\u2019s new overlords in Saudi Arabia had reportedly been planning \u2014 might never happen.\nInstead, it\u2019s Dubois, another British fighter, who has muscled his way onto the sport\u2019s top table.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nGiven his age, he could be there to stay.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThe 27-year-old Dubois might have the boxing world at his feet after a brutal fifth-round knockout of Joshua that not only legitimized his status as the IBF titleholder but made plenty sit up and take notice.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThat included Fury and Oleksandr Usyk, currently the two major powers among the heavyweights who are preparing for a rematch in Saudi in December and were seen joking around at ringside on Saturday. Usyk won their first fight in May to become the first undisputed heavyweight champion since 2000 but vacated his IBF belt in June.\nREAD: Dubois knocks out Anthony Joshua to retain IBF heavyweight title\nThe wider plan was for Joshua to take on Fury \u2014 reportedly there was an agreement on a double-header for the sum Fury was talking about \u2014 or to fight Usyk for a third time, having already lost twice to the Ukrainian.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nNow Joshua, outclassed by Dubois, looks to be out of the picture. Dubois is the main in waiting.\nAs for a potential Fury-Dubois fight, Frank Warren \u2014 the British promoter who represents both boxers \u2014 said that would put him in a \u201cvery, very awkward position.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not something I would push for,\u201d Warren said. \u201cIf there\u2019s an offer made that makes a lot of sense, then that\u2019s up to them.\u201d\nMore likely, then, is a rematch between Dubois and Usyk, especially if Usyk beats Fury. That would put all belts on the table for another fight for the title of undisputed.\nREAD: Daniel Dubois says \u2018my time\u2019 for stardom in bout vs Anthony Joshua\nUsyk stopped Dubois in the ninth round when they fought in Poland in August last year, but only after controversially getting time to recover from what was adjudged a low blow by Dubois in the fifth round.\nIt sent Usyk to the canvas, where he sat against the ropes. Replays showed the punch hitting around Usyk\u2019s belt and Dubois still maintains he was robbed.\n\u201cI want to get my rematch,\u201d Dubois said of Usyk, \u201cand put the wrong right.\u201d\nThere\u2019s video of Usyk and Dubois talking in the ring after their fight in Wroclaw, with Usyk telling his beaten challenger: \u201cDaniel, you young. You can. You can dream.\u201d\nStill, Usyk said after the Dubois-Joshua fight that he thought Joshua would win on Saturday.\n\u201cFor me, it\u2019s a surprise,\u201d said the Ukrainian.\nREAD: Usyk edges Tyson Fury to become undisputed heavyweight champion\nUysk said he was only thinking about \u201cTyson Fury and the fight and of my family and preparation\u201d when asked if he wanted to take on Dubois again.\nFury, it seems, has money on his mind, too.\nIf he loses to Usyk, Fury could still fight Joshua in what would be billed as a grudge match, but it wouldn\u2019t be so appealing and there would be no belts on the line for two fighters now in their mid-to-late 30s.\nJoshua\u2019s reputation has been seriously damaged by the way he was beaten up by Dubois, though the guy who has been a walking marketing phenomenon for the past 10 years wants to fight on.\n\u201cIt\u2019s far from over yet,\u201d Joshua said in a video released on social media platform X. \u201cWe\u2019ve done it once, done it twice. Doing it a third time hasn\u2019t been easy but I believe it\u2019s something I can achieve.\u201d\nEmulating the likes of Muhammad Ali and Lennox Lewis and becoming a three-time heavyweight champion might be beyond Joshua, though.\nYour subscription could not be saved.

        "content": "My fascination with film started when I was a kid. I remember watching the famous horror film \u201cThe Grudge\u201d alone, and for some reason, I did not feel scared at all.\nBut aside from my film fascination, there is a deeper reason why I go to the cinema at least once a month.\nI grew up in the small and beautiful municipality of Los Ba\u00f1os in the province of Laguna. As a southie, we are technically in the province but not too far from the busy and noisy streets of Manila. My mother is a vegetable market vendor, and at an early age, I saw my mother waking up around 2 a.m. to start working in our vegetable stall.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nI knew at that moment that we were not rich and that my family needed to work hard or we would starve. My mother taught me that she cannot give me everything, and she clarified that if we want something, we have to work hard for it. My father, on the other hand, is disabled and uses a wheelchair, and I never saw him walk all my life.\nFEATURED STORIES\nOPINION\nUrgent action needed vs online piracy as Congress session nears end\nOPINION\nLife has shortened\nOPINION\nThe gift of second chances\nIf life taught me something, it is that I cannot show vulnerability. I always remind myself not to cry. This mantra started when I was around 16 years old. I realized I did not come from a wealthy family, and we lacked resources, so why should I show vulnerability? Life already defeated us as kids, and I cannot allow myself to look like a loser.\nWhen I was in elementary school, I repeated first grade. My classmates were promoted to second grade while I stayed in first grade. In high school, I was in the bottom class from first to third year. I failed math and had to enroll in a summer class to be promoted to fourth year. Aside from my academic inefficiency, I was bullied from elementary to high school.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nI was a punching bag and the bullying was not just verbal but also physical. I remember my classmate from elementary school chasing me because he wanted to punch me. He reached me when I was already in the jeepney, and he punched me in the face. Again, I reminded myself that I should not cry. My classmate from high school threw an eraser in my face while her friends laughed at me; again, I reminded myself that I should not cry. My other classmate from second-year high school pushed and dragged me to the floor. Again, I couldn\u2019t cry. The universe knows how much I wanted to cry in those moments but I couldn\u2019t show that I was defeated.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nI tried to show my vulnerability to my teacher but in the end, according to her, it was my fault. That made me realize that all I had was myself and I should not show vulnerability because they would see me as weak and blame me. It was painful, but I did not cry.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nMy disabled father died in February 2013; I did not cry. My maternal grandmother passed away in July 2023 and my paternal grandmother died in May 2024; as always, I did not cry. I already programmed the idea that instead of crying, I should ask, \u201cOkay, how will I move forward?\u201d So, instead of crying, my mind would shift to troubleshooting without grieving properly.\nLately, I have been experiencing pressure and existential questions. There is the constant pressure to be successful, the never-ending reminder that I have to be better than yesterday; even the idea of surviving gracefully in my graduate studies and working simultaneously while thinking of how to be a great son to my mother, a brother to my siblings, and an uncle to my nephew.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nI deactivated my Facebook account last month. As a heavy Facebook user, this was a big decision. Aside from the peace of mind that deactivation offered, I did not want people (even social media friends) to see me in my vulnerable phase.\nMy friends and colleagues perceive me as a skilled and intelligent person who cannot show sadness. However, I feel guilty since most have contacted me and asked if I am okay. I want to tell them I am okay and getting better but I need more time to embrace these emotions. I hope they lend me their ears once I feel ready to talk.\nSo why do I go to the cinema at least once a month? You probably have a hint of why. It is because I cry at the cinema. I use the cinema as an avenue for me to cry. I know that if I cry there, no one will judge me. Imagine watching a horror film in the cinema but I am crying. Whatever the genre is, whenever I go to the cinema, I feel like I am free to be vulnerable, to cry, and to be free of judgment.\nCrying in the dim, large cinema room is a big step for me\u2014a big step to acknowledge and take time to embrace these emotions\u2014step by step and little by little. I hope to be vulnerable to someone very soon, but for now, allow me to sit in the comfortable cinema seat, cry, and be vulnerable, just like the actors onscreen.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\nYour subscription could not be saved.

        "content": "The Makabayan Bloc\u2019s recent announcement of its slate for next year\u2019s senatorial elections has sparked hope among progressive Filipinos. Their candidates offer a stark alternative to the government\u2019s lineup. But the question remains: Are we ready to elect leaders from the working class?\nHistorically, the legislative branch has been dominated by those with strong political backgrounds or celebrities leveraging their fame. In contrast, candidates from the working class bring their firsthand experience of the struggles faced by ordinary Filipinos. There\u2019s France Castro of the Alliance of Concerned Teachers party list who has tirelessly advocated for the rights and fair compensation of public school teachers; Ronnel Arambulo of Pambansang Lakas ng Kilusang Mamamalakaya ng Pilipinas who defends the fishing rights of Filipinos in our territorial waters, and Mody Floranda, national president of Piston, who champions affordable transport services. These candidates, among others, embody the everyday experiences of most Filipinos and are deeply connected to their causes.\nDespite its dedication, the Makabayan Bloc faces significant challenges, particularly the stigma of being associated with the Communist Party of the Philippines\u2014a narrative perpetuated by the Duterte administration. This label, reinforced by relentless Red-tagging by the National Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Conflict, subjects the bloc to continuous attacks from critics and online trolls. The prevailing sentiment\u2014\u201cbasta aktibista, terrorista\u201d\u2014illustrates how successfully the government has influenced public perception, turning the Left from agents of change into perceived nuisances. They are often dismissed as \u201creklamador at maingay,\u201d reinforcing the idea that Filipinos should simply obey the authorities.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nFor all these obstacles, the Makabayan Bloc has proven itself a formidable force in Philippine politics, consistently exposing government corruption and advocating for the marginalized. Its stance at the House of Representatives during the budget hearing of Vice President Sara Duterte shows its commitment to hold the government accountable. It remains a crucial watchdog against irregularities, ensuring that the voices of the people are heard.\nFEATURED STORIES\nOPINION\nUrgent action needed vs online piracy as Congress session nears end\nOPINION\nLife has shortened\nOPINION\nThe gift of second chances\nBut to truly effect change, the bloc must confront the deeply entrenched \u201cpalakasan system\u201d in Philippine politics. National elections often reflect a story of power dynamics from below\u2014politicians seeking financial support from wealthy families during elections in exchange for future favors in what is seen as \u201cutang na loob.\u201d This is apparent in the current senatorial slate of the Partido Federal ng Pilipinas, Lakas-CMD, Nationalist People\u2019s Coalition, and Nacionalista Party, whose established parties present a formidable challenge for Makabayan, having dominated local politics for the longest time. With electoral politics in the Philippines being driven more by personality and money than by ideology, their easy name recall as perennial politicians leave little room for new faces who prioritize policy over persona.\nA significant factor that has compounded these challenges is the decentralization of political power, which was initially intended to empower regions economically and politically. Instead, decentralization has inadvertently exacerbated local-level corruption and entrenched the dominance of traditional political families. Instead of democratizing power and enabling grassroots leadership, it has often shifted corruption, collusion, and nepotism from the central government to regional authorities. With greater autonomy, local politicians can continue to engage in vote-buying and patronage politics, making it even more difficult for ideological candidates like those from the Makabayan Bloc to gain a foothold.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThis absence of working-class representation in our political institutions has severe consequences for public policy, as the interests of ordinary Filipinos are often sidelined in favor of the entrenched elites. The decentralized political structure, instead of being a tool for empowerment, has become another arena where the power of the few is perpetuated.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nSo, the question is: Who will bring justice and leave a lasting legacy for the next generation? Will it be leaders who genuinely fight for the people, or a government that continues to exploit its citizens and normalize corruption in the widespread belief that \u201cpolitics is dirty\u201d?\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nWhen one of my students expressed disdain for activism, arguing that \u201cthe Left is not compatible with our values or our form of government,\u201d I responded simply: \u201cYou will understand the importance of the Left when you or your family are directly affected.\u201d\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nSensei M.

        "content": "Piolo Pascual in \u201cPamilya Sagrado\u201d \u2014PHOTO COURTESY OF DREAMSCAPE ENTERTAINMENT\nPiolo Pascual doesn\u2019t merely look good, youthful and refreshed these days. \u201cI feel good,\u201d the 47-year-old actor told us when he, along with his twentysomething costars Kyle Echarri and Grae Fernandez, met the press to announce \u201cPamilya Sagrado\u2019s\u201d time slot adjustment last Sunday. \u201cMy endorsements require me to look presentable and fit, so it comes with the territory. I\u2019m in good shape [because] I take care of myself.\u201d\nBeyond all that physical pluperfection, however, is a string of good reasons for the country\u2019s No. 1 heartthrob to feel engaged and \u201creenergized.\u201d He attributes this to the risks he began taking at the height of the pandemic.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nAsked what clicked for him during the long and stultifying lockdowns and drove him to pick riskier roles (as a serial killer in \u201cMallari\u201d and as Padre Pedro Pelaez in \u201cGomBurZa\u201d) and pursue brand-new artistic endeavors (like making his foray into musical theater via \u201cIbarra\u201d), Piolo said, \u201cI had a wake-up call. I remember wanting to quit before turning 40. I wanted to quit while I was still on top.\nFEATURED STORIES\nENTERTAINMENT\nJericho Rosales raves over Janine Gutierrez's calendar girl stint\nENTERTAINMENT\nRetired cop finds trove of unreleased Michael Jackson songs \u2013 report\nENTERTAINMENT\nHow being a \u2018soft boy\u2019 empowered Maki to stay true to himself\n\u201cBut I was humbled by the Lord, who made me realize there were still a lot of projects I could do. Like, \u2018How dare you resist or refuse work that comes your way? You can be a conduit or a vessel for projects that can help people or illuminate their minds.\n\u201cThat epiphany led to renewed excitement about my career. During the pandemic, I realized how boring it was to stay idle (laughs)! Ayokong walang ginagawa (I didn\u2019t like being unproductive). When things began to ease up, hindi na talaga ako tumigil (I never stopped working). I finished four movies during the pandemic. Thereafter, I kept doing stuff left and right\u2014and that hasn\u2019t stopped since. I just try to bring my A game every time so I won\u2019t regret doing them or feel like I was compromising [on the quality].\u201d\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nTo greater heights\nIf we go by the acting awards he has won so far for his portrayals in \u201cGomBurZa,\u201d \u201cMallari\u201d and even \u201cIbarra,\u201d it certainly doesn\u2019t look like Piolo has been making some ill-advised judgment calls.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\n\u201cI\u2019m just kilig [about all of this],\u201d he quipped, beaming. \u201cYou know, I was asked by direk Mike Tuviera (director of \u2018The Kingdom,\u2019 his upcoming Metro Manilla Film Festival entry with Vic Sotto) if I accept projects with awards in mind.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\n\u201cI said, \u2018I never do something to get an award, because winning one is just a reward [for a job well done]. It isn\u2019t something you ask for. So when I get one, I\u2019m so grateful for it. It fuels me to keep doing better.\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I was emotional when I won an Aliw award [for best actor] for \u2018Ibarra.\u2019 It got to a point where, while I was holding my trophy, I couldn\u2019t believe where that role has led me. It made me feel grateful for the opportunities that have been coming my way.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\n\u201cYou know that the risks and challenges you take on are pushing you to greater heights. You don\u2019t expect to get anything from them. It\u2019s really just a matter of going for it and giving every character your 100 percent.\u201d\nHis role in ABS-CBN\u2019s top-rated series \u201cPamilya Sagrado\u201d\u2014as Rafael Sagrado, who will stop at nothing to protect the family name\u2014is no exception.\nPiolo is enjoying his unconventional, cache-boosting role in the Dreamscape Entertainment production so much that he said he can\u2019t wait to do another teleserye. Need we say that uncovering Moises Malonzo\u2019s (Kyle) true identity could raise the stakes even higher for Rafael, Justin (Grae) and the other characters in the series?\n\u201cI\u2019m excited to do another series, yeah,\u201d Piolo stated. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever stop acting. After \u2018Flower of Evil\u2019 and \u2018Pamilya Sagrado,\u2019 I\u2019ve already asked Dreamscape and ABS-CBN what they have in store for me after this (laughs).\n\u201cThat\u2019s where my renewed excitement or enthusiasm for unique content is coming from \u2026 giving life to characters that have become increasingly more diverse. Because nowadays, we have more choices for roles and greater access to different platforms.\n\u201cI\u2019ll never stop creating content or producing stuff that would keep me productive. I want new concepts and ideas that we can champion \u2026 something that our audiences can truly be proud of.\u201d\nDuring the interview, we reminded Piolo that \u201cReal Life Fiction,\u201d his bleak existentialist film directed by Paul Soriano (and costarring Jasmine Curtis-Smith) that began playing in cinemas last week, also tapped into pertinent mental health issues and how man\u2019s sense of uncertainty and deepest fears could play tricks on him.\nWhile it may not be every viewer\u2019s cup of tea, it is nevertheless a spot-on depiction of what people were all feeling at the height of the pandemic in 2020.\n\u201cThat film was haunting to a certain extent, because it delves into the psyche of a person\u2014a popular actor-turned-director named Paco\u2014who is very similar to me. He\u2019s dealing with his inner demons. It was like me mirroring myself, so it felt very close to home. And I had to really shake the character off after working on it and detach myself from him right away.\n\u2018Disturbing thoughts\u2019\n\u201cYou know how things are when a role haunts you\u2026 it leaves a mark and stays in the back of your head. Take \u2018Mallari,\u2019 I get scared when I watch it now, so that isn\u2019t something I want to do again any time soon.\u201d\nWas Piolo also feeling Paco\u2019s issues during the lockdown?\n\u201cYes, I felt that especially during the pandemic \u2026 when there was so much uncertainty swirling all around us. I guess that was why I didn\u2019t want to stay home and just work and not get stuck doing nothing \u2026 because I didn\u2019t want to have to deal with those [disturbing] thoughts.\u201d\nSince characters like Rafael in \u201cPamilya Sagrado\u201d can be perceived as hero-antiheroes, Piolo was asked how he deals with real \u201ccontravidas\u201d in the crazy world that he inhabits.\nYour subscription could not be saved.

Ako mismo ang kontrabida sa sarili ko (I am my own contravida). So, before I judge people, I place myself in their shoes \u2026 because that\u2019s just another way for me to understand myself better.\u201d\nREAD NEXT\nSay his name three times and he will appear; \u2018Beetlejuic...\nLove Knots, September 6, 2024\nEDITORS' PICK\nFilipino film \u2018Haligi\u2019 considered for Golden Globes\nSOCIAL CLIMATE: Life has shortened\nComelec exempts 48 projects from election ban\nDOH: Undiagnosed HIV cases contribute to spread of virus\nFil-Am actor steals spotlight in Blackpink Ros\u00e9\u2019s music video\nMore foreign brands seen coming to PH shores in 2025\nMOST READ\nComelec exempts 48 projects from election ban\nLorraine Badoy after red-tagging civil suit loss: \u2018Fight isn\u2019t over\u2019\nBar exam 2024: List of successful examinees\n3 schools have highest percentage of passers among first-time bar exam takers\nFollow\n@FMangosingINQ\non Twitter\n-->\nView comments",

        "content": "Invoking the \u2018power of we,\u2019 the Institute of Corporate Directors Philippines (ICD Ph) described the critical synergy between the public and private sectors in advancing good governance to foster pro-poor and inclusive growth and fighting corruption and fraud.\nIn a press briefing to launch the Global Governance Summit on September 19 with the theme, \u201cLeading the Future, Strengthening Unity, ICD board of directors was in unison in advocating their message of \u201cDoing things right and the right way.\u201d\n\u201cIt takes two to tango,\u201d Dr. Jesus Estanislad, chairman emeritus and ICD founder, said. \u201cIt is important for the private sector to practice corporate governance to facilitate growth. However, on the flip side, we also must have a strong partnership with the public sector for good public governance to create a positive political and economic environment that will attract investors, thus achieving inclusive growth.\u201d\nICD vice chairman Imelda \u201cIda\u201d Tiongson highlighted the importance of good corporate governance in building global trust and enhancing perceptions about the country.\n\u201cInclusive growth has always been a hot topic,\u201d Tiongson said, adding, \u201cGood governance, as an instrument and constituent of the welfare of the poor, is critical to poverty reduction because good governance facilitates participatory, pro-poor policies and sound macroeconomic management. It ensures the transparent use of public funds, encourages growth of the private sector, promotes effective delivery of public services, and helps to establish the rule of law.\u201d\nShe added that the combination of political, economic, and institutional features of good governance, especially the control of corruption and regulatory quality, improves the income of the poor and decreases poverty.\nAccording to the ICD, good corporate governance, as embodied in the control of corruption and the design and implementation of effective regulatory policies, significantly improves the ability of people with low incomes to participate in and benefit from economic growth.\nFor his part, Senen \u201cBing\u201d L. Matoto, ICD board member and president of the Rotary Club of Makati, stated that good corporate governance helps companies operate more efficiently, improve access to capital, mitigate risk and safeguard against mismanagement.\n\u201cIt makes companies more accountable and transparent to investors and gives them the tools to respond to stakeholder concerns,\u201d Matoto said.\nTo achieve these goals, the ICD is partnering with some schools and Church organizations to imbibe good governance \u201cat a young age,\u201d and at the community level.\n\u201cWe are all in this together. We must work together to achieve good governance and fight the three biggest challenges that hinder our growth: &nbsp; Corruption, poverty, and the lack of civic-mindedness,\u201d Estanislao said.\nHe added, \u201cIf you have corruption, then there is poverty. But we have corruption because there is a lack of civic mindedness among Filipinos. So we have to address those challenges through participative good governance.\u201d\nLong way to go\nICD Ph president Atty. Pedro Maniego lauded the initiatives of the ICD founding members, adding that through their perseverance, the organization is now celebrating its silver anniversary and ready to address the country\u2019s corporate governance challenges.\nHe said, \u201cThe Philippines has made considerable strides since its inception. However, our country still lags behind its ASEAN neighbors in the Corporate Governance Scorecard. We cannot and should not remain in a business-as-usual mode to catch up and eventually surpass our counterparts. We must do much more!\u201d\nHowever, Maniego said that although we face challenging times, the Philippines has performed well and consistently registered a significant economic growth rate. \u201cBut it is still way behind in FDIs versus our ASEAN neighbors primarily due to poor perception of its global competitiveness.\nGood governance creates a stable and transparent environment needed to attract investment that drives economic growth. It enhances a country\u2019s global reputation, building trust and confidence among international partners and citizens.\u201d\nADVT.&nbsp;\nThis article is brought to you by&nbsp;The Institute of Corporate Directors Philippines (ICD Ph)\nREAD NEXT\nAlice Guo\u2019s escape: BI, CAAP must be held accountable, s...\nPhilippines to process \u2018limited number\u2019 of Afghans...\nEDITORS' PICK\n2 PH enterprises recognized as Asia's best innovators\nUS developing topical vaccine that you rub on the skin\nNBA: Embiid hit in face, misses 2nd half of 76ers' loss to Pacers\nComelec exempts 48 projects from election ban\nHouse panel: Duterte center of grand criminal enterprise\nCourt clears model in Julie Ann Rodelas slay, but boyfriend found guilty\nMOST READ\nComelec exempts 48 projects from election ban\nLorraine Badoy after red-tagging civil suit loss: \u2018Fight isn\u2019t over\u2019\nBar exam 2024: List of successful examinees\n3 schools have highest percentage of passers among first-time bar exam takers\nFollow\n@FMangosingINQ\non Twitter\n-->\nView comments",

The Philippines has also expanded security cooperation with Japan, another key US ally in East Asia, angering China.\n\u201cThe Chinese side believes that defense cooperation between countries should not target any third party or disrupt regional peace and stability,\u201d Zhang Xiaogang, a spokesperson for China\u2019s defense ministry, said on the ministry\u2019s social media account.\n\u201cThe Philippines are inviting wolves into the house and willingly acting as their pawns, which is despised by other regional countries,\u201d Zhang said.\nThe 97-meter Teresa Magbanua, a multirole response vessel, has been stationed at the shoal since mid-April.\nIt is the PCG\u2019s longest deployment of its largest ship in the West Philippine Sea to counter China\u2019s incursions in the country\u2019s 370-kilometer exclusive economic zone (EEZ).\nChina deployed its China Coast Guard (CCG) vessel with hull number 5303 to the shoal to replace China\u2019s \u201cmonster ship,\u201d the CCG vessel with bow number 5901, which left the shoal on Aug. 10.Shoal as staging area\nA coral reef formation with a central lagoon, Escoda Shoal is 140 km west of Palawan, well within the Philippines\u2019 EEZ.\nIt has been used by the Philippine Navy and the PCG as a staging area for the resupply missions to Ayungin (Second Thomas) Shoal, which is also within the country\u2019s EEZ.\nResponding to a report by Chinese state media Global Times, PCG spokesperson for the West Philippine Sea Commodore Jay Tarrriela dismissed China\u2019s fears that the Philippines was building a \u201cforward deployment base\u201d at the shoal as \u201cunfounded\u201d and \u201cabsurd.\u201d\nThe Global Times reported that a second PCG ship was \u201cscheduled to illegally enter\u201d the waters off the shoal to join the Teresa Magbanua for \u201cjoint anchoring.\u201d\nTarriela said China\u2019s suspicions about the Philippines engaging in such actions \u201cstem from their own pattern of unlawfully occupying maritime areas in the South China Sea, followed by illegal reclamation and provocative militarization of those features.\u201d\nHe added that the Global Times\u2019 report was made to \u201cto shape perceptions among their domestic audience and the international community, asserting that they have legitimate claims over the entire South China Sea\u201d and to \u201cdistract the international community from their unlawful actions and aggressive behavior.\u201d\nContinental shelf claim\nIn June, China also protested against the Philippines\u2019 request to extend its continental shelf claim in a United Nations body.\nBeijing appealed to the UN Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf to \u201cnot to consider\u201d the submission filed on June 14 by the Philippines, which invoked its right under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea.\nBeijing said that the extended continental shelf beyond 370 km \u201cseriously infringed\u201d on China\u2019s sovereignty, sovereign rights and jurisdiction in the South China Sea.\nAlmost the entire South China Sea, including the West Philippine Sea is being claimed by China. This claim has been invalidated by an international arbitral tribunal, which ruled that China had no legal basis for it.\nManila, on the other hand, has filed numerous diplomatic protests against Beijing\u2019s actions in the West Philippine Sea. According to the DFA, the Philippines has filed over 150 diplomatic protests against China since President Marcos took office.\nFlare shots\nThe latest followed the Aug. 8 harassment of a Philippine Air Force (PAF) plane by two Chinese air force combat fighters while it was flying over the country\u2019s territorial waters over Panatag (Scarborough) Shoal.\nThe Chinese jets fired flares into the path of the PAF plane which was on patrol. The twin-propeller aircraft was safe and no one on board was harmed.\nArmed Forces of the Philippines chief Gen. Romeo Brawner Jr. condemned the \u201cprovocative actions\u201d of the People\u2019s Liberation Army Air Force, pointing out that it \u201cendangered the lives of [Filipino] personnel undertaking maritime security operations\u201d.

        "content": "Part 2\nLast week, we discussed how our Asean neighbors have been busy attracting large, high-tech investments from foreign multinational companies. Below are some areas we can improve on to make the Philippines more attractive to high-quality investments.\nThere is good news here\nA common observation is that Philippine news headlines often highlight the negative. Crime stories to political scandals usually dominate the headlines of our news reports. This is not unique to the Philippines but it feels pervasive and, unfortunately, this shapes public perception and sentiment.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nREAD:\nHow the Philippines can attract high-tech investments\nFEATURED STORIES\nBUSINESS\nMore foreign brands seen coming to PH shores in 2025\nBUSINESS\nGlobal Dominion: Simplifying financing to empower every Filipino\nBUSINESS\nInternational group kicks off infrastructure investment drive for PH\nThis may not necessarily reflect journalistic intent to spread negativity, but perhaps more of a response to audience demand and engagement metrics. Stories about corruption, natural disasters, and social issues may attract more viewer or reader interest.\nBad news can overshadow positive developments and achievements happening across the country. Accordingly, our media should incorporate more inspiring stories of community resilience, innovative startups, and cultural milestones, in order to balance out the usual sensational and grim news.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nSafety &amp; Security\nOn July 18, 2024, the article \u201cThe 10 Most \u2018Risky\u2019 Cities in The World Have Been Revealed for 2024\u201d was published by The Independent, a British online newspaper.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nManila, Philippines was ranked as the 5th most risky city in the world.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nAccording to the article, the study and rankings were based on the Forbes Advisor report and addressed to tourists. The study compared 60 international cities on seven risk categories, including crime, personal security, health, infrastructure, natural disaster and digital security to create a travel safety rating.\nThe top 10 risky cities cited were:\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nCaracas, Venezuela \u2013 100 risk score\nKarachi, Pakistan \u2013 93.12 risk score\nYangon, Myanmar \u2013 91.67 risk score\nLagos, Nigeria \u2013 91.54 risk score\nManila, Philippines \u2013 91.49 risk score\nDhaka, Bangladesh \u2013 89.5 risk score\nBogota, Colombia \u2013 86.7 risk score\nCairo, Egypt \u2013 83.44 risk score\nMexico City, Mexico \u2013 82.43 risk score\nQuito, Ecuador \u2013 82.02 risk score\nWhile the report focuses on tourists, foreign investors will surely think twice about investing as their personnel may hesitate to relocate to the Philippines.\nElectricity / Power Prices\nAnother obstacle in attracting investments is the relatively high cost of electricity of the Philippines, particularly in the manufacturing sector. Technology investments in the field of data centers and artificial intelligence are also energy intensive which makes the price of electricity a factor by multinational companies when considering the location as to where to invest.\nUnfortunately, among Asean countries, the Philippines\u2019 electricity prices per kWh is one of the highest, second only to Singapore.\nWages\nIn an interview last year at the Laging Handa Public Briefing, Employers Confederation of the Philippines (ECOP) President Sergio Ortiz-Luis Jr. stated that based on data by the National Wages and Productivity Commission, the Philippines\u2019 $10.14 daily minimum wage rate is second only to Malaysia with $11.16 as of August 2022. Indonesia is third highest with $10, followed by Thailand\u2019s $9.23 and Vietnam\u2019s $6.6. Singapore has no legislated minimum wage.\nOf course, this is little consolation to Philippine workers as even with the yearly increase in the minimum wage, they find it a struggle to make ends meet.\nAccordingly, tempering the wage rates in the country must come hand in hand with managing the cost of living and goods the government and employers must ensure that our workers will earn a \u201cliving wage\u201d, or that which is sufficient to cover living expenses.\nInternet Speed and connectivity\nIn today\u2019s business world, internet connectivity and speed are no longer just conveniences, they are critical to success considering that digital transformation is quickly sweeping across all industries.\nOur fixed broadband speeds are still behind that of our ASEAN neighbors. That having been said, we have made progress in improving connectivity and our internet speed. It may be just that our neighbors have also improved their internet infrastructure which means that we must continue to improve our internet connectivity and speed in order to stay competitive.\n(Fixed Broadband Download Speed in Mbps across Asean Countries, Jan-May 2023/ www.dict.gov.ph)\n(Fixed Broadband Upload Speed in Mbps across Asean Countries, Jan-May 2023. www.dict.gov.ph)\nEase of Doing Business\nThe ease of doing business in a country is a critical factor that influences investor decisions on whether to invest their capital and money in a country. The concept includes regulatory environment, efficiency of government services, and overall business climate within a country.\nIn this aspect, the Philippines unfortunately lags behind its Asean counterparts as Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Brunei, Vietnam and Indonesia have a higher index score than the Philippines.\nYour subscription could not be saved.

The opposition claims to have collected records from more than 80 percent of the 30,000 polling booths nationwide showing it won.\nMaduro announced Saturday that the government has arrested 2,000 opponents and at a rally in Caracas he pledged to detain more people and send them to prison. The post-electoral uprising has also claimed at least 11 deaths, according to Foro Penal, a Caracas-based human rights group.\nThe Venezuela-based human rights organization Provea, in a report issued Monday analyzing the post-election climate, concluded that the government\u2019s response to silence people\u2019s discontent has been \u201cthrough the disproportionate use of force\u201d that has resulted in the deaths of protesters, \u201cthe open coordinated action between security forces and groups of armed civilians in favor of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro to calm the protests, and the exponential increase in arbitrary arrests.\u201d\nREAD:\nLeaders worldwide express concern over increasing arrests in Venezuela\nThe organization reported that based on figures announced by the Attorney General\u2019s Office last week, the number of arrests against real or perceived government opponents is equivalent to about 42 percent \u201cof the total number of arbitrary arrests recorded by Provea between April and August 2017, the most important cycle of protests in the country since 1989.\u201d\nGonz\u00e1lez and Machado in their missive called on Venezuelans with family members serving in the security forces to urge their loved ones not to attack protesters and obey illegal orders.

        "content": "Jakarta\u2014The Indo-Pacific security order could face profound implications from the geopolitical developments that have occurred since June.\nRecent developments point to an outlook for Asean that looks bleaker than ever.\nFirst, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy spoke at the 21st Shangri-La Dialogue in June to promote the Peace Summit for Ukraine, held on June 15-16 in Switzerland. However, only four out of the 10 Asean member states attended the summit: Indonesia, the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nRegardless of the reasons, the underwhelming attendance by Asean countries demonstrates that the grouping continues to lack a united position on the Russia-Ukraine war and more importantly, on the broader issue of addressing violations of international law and the United Nations Charter.\nFEATURED STORIES\nOPINION\nUrgent action needed vs online piracy as Congress session nears end\nOPINION\nLife has shortened\nOPINION\nThe gift of second chances\nSome Asean leaders have espoused the notion of the grouping becoming a growing pole in a multipolar world that handles issues with its interests in mind, rather than through the prism of the great powers. After all, Asean has its merits, such as its various cooperative mechanisms, and 54 countries including Russia and Ukraine have acceded to its Treaty of Amity and Cooperation (TAC).\nHowever, the persistent Russia-Ukraine war suggests that the treaty is a sidelined instrument to uphold the rules and norms that undergird international peace. The TAC is sacrosanct to Asean, as it is not an alliance that wields hard power. Hence, the grouping must exercise normative power to be taken seriously as a pole in the multipolar world, but it is floundering in this aspect.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThe second development relates to the dispute between China and the Philippines in the South China Sea (SCS). The confrontation on June 17 near Second Thomas Shoal seemed like an escalation, as the Philippines reported that Chinese forces wielded bladed weapons for the first time, similar to the tactics seen during altercations between Chinese and Indian troops at the Himalayan border.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nAs the US-Philippines mutual defense treaty was not invoked, the red line that President Marcos mentioned during the Shangri-La Dialogue has not been crossed. Instead, the region may be witnessing an expansion of gray zone tactics in the SCS.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThis confrontation reinforced the perception that the Code of Conduct is an exercise in futility or a demonstration of Asean\u2019s normative powerlessness. Furthermore, Asean remained silent, even days after the confrontation had passed. If Asean chooses to stay quiet when similar incidents reoccur or to be vocal only when the red line is crossed, any repeat of the rhetoric of Asean centrality could appear fallacious, if not disingenuous.\nThe third development is that the Chinese premier\u2019s visit to Malaysia and the Russian president\u2019s visit to Vietnam came as backdrops to Malaysia\u2019s and Vietnam\u2019s interest in joining BRICS, which has evolved into a grouping that offers an alternative to the Western-led multilateral order. Other Asean countries\u2014Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, and Thailand\u2014have also expressed various levels of interest.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nWhile the expansion of BRICS membership and the China-India rivalry might make the grouping more incoherent, it is nonetheless clear that some Asean countries see potential value in joining the organization. This value includes reducing reliance on the dollar, which the US has weaponized as a policy tool.\nHowever, as China\u2019s assertiveness in foreign policy and as an economic power make it a dominant party in BRICS, Asean countries that become BRICS members may find it difficult not to pander to China\u2019s sensitivities relating to the SCS.\nThis scenario also envisages the Philippines facing an increasingly lonely struggle for sovereign rights in the SCS and aligning even closer to the US\u2019 network of allies. Singapore could find itself in a similar position, given its relative closeness to the West and strong advocacy of international law, as seen from its support for the Permanent Court of Arbitration\u2019s 2016 ruling on the SCS and sanctions imposed on Russia for invading Ukraine.\nWhere does it leave Asean as a normative entrepreneur and driver of regional security cooperation if its members and partners become even less like-minded and begin looking at non-Asean security (and economic) initiatives even more?\nThe rise of new minilaterals like AUKUS and JAPHUS essentially cast a shadow of rivalry on the region, instead of the cooperation envisioned by the Asean Outlook on the Indo-Pacific that Indonesia spearheaded. Now, the region faces the idea of a new security architecture that Putin proposed during his visit to Vietnam and after Russia signed a new defense pact with North Korea.\nThe grouping expects the Asean Political and Security Community Strategic Plan for Asean Community Vision 2045 to be ready by the end of 2024 and adopted in 2025. But it might want to take a step back and examine the potential implications of these recent geopolitical developments.

        "content": "I am autistic with co-occurring bipolar disorder. Every time I disclose to others that I have such an identity, there are mixed responses. But most of the time, people shy away from me, especially the fact that having such an identity is a disability. There was a point wherein my landlady kicked me out of the boarding house all because of my disability. The worst part was that not only did she force me to disclose my disability but she also infantilized me. Sounds ridiculous, right?\nWhether I like it or not, the fact remains that most people perceive disabled persons as a burden that should be ignored. Looking around, I could see how degrading life is as a disabled person. From the lack of ramps to defective elevators, how could disabled people survive under these conditions? And don\u2019t expect them to teleport just to gain accessibility for we don\u2019t have such technology at the moment.\nAs a self-identified disabled person myself, I also observed how the media regards us. Disabled persons are usually left out in the media like what happened during the COVID-19 pandemic. This is despite disabled persons being one of the most affected sectors since they had a hard time accessing basic services from the government. Whenever news outlets train the spotlight on disabled persons, they are infantilized, used for \u201cinspiration,\u201d or worse, ridiculed.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nI remember the time when the \u201cBoyet Challenge\u201d became viral on social media. It mockingly mimicked a character played by Ken Chan in the series \u201cMy Special Tatay.\u201d The character was not autistic but had some sort of mental retardation, yet it still affected the autistic community. Even the Autism Society of the Philippines denounced the challenge. Such ridiculing of disabled persons has been repeated several times on social media.\nFEATURED STORIES\nOPINION\nUrgent action needed vs online piracy as Congress session nears end\nOPINION\nLife has shortened\nOPINION\nThe gift of second chances\nI remember when news broke out that Brina Maxino, a Filipino with Down Syndrome, graduated from college with flying colors. She later became Unesco\u2019s Global Champion of Inclusive Education representing Asia-Pacific. While many praised her for her achievements, most used her as a commodity, leading to what the late Australian Stella Young called \u201cinspiration porn.\u201d From the term itself, it is about commodifying disabled persons as an inspiration to the audience.\nI remember the time when Congress proposed a bill that would ban alcoholic beverages for those who have a physical and mental disability. Critics such as Arpee Lazaro from PWD Philippines and myself responded to this by saying that it goes against what disabled persons are fighting for: A true sense of equality with those without disabilities. It also tends to infantilize disabled persons to the point of degrading the right of the disabled to make informed decisions.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nWith all these conditions, people are wondering whether having a disability is wrong. After all, we are dealing with being resilient by providing ourselves with our own assistive devices to \u201cmask\u201d our disability. This mindset has been ingrained in us because of how society has viewed and treated us for so long.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nLet me tell you: There is nothing wrong with disability.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThere is also nothing wrong with the word \u201cdisability.\u201d Rather, we need to respond to how most people perceive disability. After all, the reason why most perceive disability as a burden is due to the ableist restrictions we have from lack of accessibility, infantilization, inspiration porn, up to public ridiculing. Such is inherently connected to our economic system wherein we aspire to have an ideal and typical body to survive.\nThis needs a call for action to change the status quo. In light of the current situation of disabled people, we must remind ourselves that we deserve to be treated better. Just like able-bodied people, we have rights, and these rights are enshrined in laws such as the UN Declaration on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the Magna Carta for Persons with Disabilities. Let us push for greater justice for the disabled community so that we can feel the sense of dignity that breaks free from ableist restrictions.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nI am a disabled person and I am proud to be part of the community.\nRonald G. De Guzman Jr., 22, is a mathematics student at the University of the Philippines Baguio.

The government enacted and implemented key policy reforms and initiatives to create a more enabling policy and regulatory environment for investment and economic growth,\u201d Balisacan said.\nHe noted that critical to achieving the 5 percent to 6 percent annual target infrastructure spending to GDP is the continued evaluation, approval, and rollout of the 185 Infrastructure Flagship Projects under the \u201cBuild Better More\u201d program.\nThese big-ticket projects spanning various sectors are collectively valued at PHP9.54 trillion, or approximately USD163 billion.\nTo date, three projects are already completed \u2014 the Samar Pacific Coastal Road Project, Integrated Disaster Risk Reduction and Climate Change Adaptation Measures in the Low-Lying Areas of Pampanga Bay Project, and the Flood Risk Improvement and Management Project for Cagayan de Oro River.\nBalisacan said 63 other projects are underway, 31 more have been approved for implementation, six are awaiting government approval, and 82 are in the preparation stage.\nAside from infrastructure development, he also cited the need to boost investments and improve export performance.\nYour subscription could not be saved.

According to ADOR, last week\u2019s events had special meaning to the girl band as they became the fastest non-Japanese musicians to perform at the Tokyo Dome, achieving this milestone just one year and 11 months after their debut in 2022. He mentioned nothing publicly about it, either.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThis contrasts sharply with his participation in the 2024 Festa in Seoul on June 13, an annual fan meeting event celebrating BTS\u2019 anniversary, where he congratulated Jin on completing his military service. He even shared a photo with Jin on his Instagram account, right afterward.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nIn a brief teaser of the reality TV show \u201cPoint of Omniscient Interfere,\u201d aired by MBC on June 29, the chairman was seen meeting with the K-pop boy band Enhypen of Belift Lab, another music label under Hybe, and having a conversation with them in the waiting room after their performance at Weverse Con, HYBE\u2019s annual music festival held in Seoul on June 16.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nIn November last year, Bang even attended legendary K-pop star Uhm Jung-hwa\u2019s solo concert to show his support and promote it on his social media.\nBang has zero feed about NewJeans in his Instagram account until now.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nBang has previously stated in local interviews that he does not attend an artist\u2019s concert or event unless he is officially invited, as he does not want to put psychological pressure on the musicians, who might even perceive it as arrogant. The chairman also says he maintains a strict policy of not interfering with Hybe music labels\u2019 independent management.\nLE SSERAFIM member Hong Eun-chae speaks about Le Sserafim\u2019s visit to chairman Bang\u2019s luxury house in Los Angeles. Image: The Korea Herald\nNonetheless, it appears that Bang has less affection for NewJeans than other HYBE-affiliated artists.\nHong Eun-chae, a singer from LE SSERAFIM, another K-pop girl group managed by sub-label Source Music, mentioned on her YouTube channel \u201cEunchae\u2019s Star Diary\u201d in March that Bang had invited all the members to his luxury mansion in Los Angeles. There have been no reports of NewJeans having a private meeting with the chairman in the US, despite their bigger presence there than LE SSERAFIM.\nIn an earlier episode of Eunchae\u2019s Star Diary aired in February, two other LE SSERAFIM members Huh Yun-jin and Sakura Miyawaki, were given a mission by fans to text Bang and see who would receive a reply first. They all received a message back from Bang equally in 40 minutes, demonstrating their close relationship with the chairman.\nYour subscription could not be saved.

Agence France-Presse\nMANILA, Philippines \u2014 The Chinese Foreign Ministry lambasted on Monday President Ferdinand \u201cBongbong\u201d Marcos Jr.\u2019s remarks at the 21st Shangri-La Dialogue, calling it an attempt to \u201cdisregard history, designed to amplify the Philippines\u2019 wrongful position on the South China Sea\u201d row.\nThe unnamed foreign ministry spokesperson\u2019s statement was forwarded to the media on the afternoon of June 3 \u2013 days after Marcos delivered his speech explaining the legal basis for the Philippines\u2019 territory and maritime zones.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nIn his speech, Marcos insisted that Manila\u2019s claims in the South China Sea \u201care derived not from imagination, but from international law.\u201d\nFEATURED STORIES\nWWW\nLIVE UPDATES: Bar exam results 2024\nWWW\nTeodoro says petitions to cancel candidacy \u2018political maneuvering\u2019\nWWW\nLabor group seeks suspension of ballot printing for 2025 polls\nREAD:\nMarcos: PH won\u2019t yield West Philippine Sea; to defend it at all cost\nThis, however, did not sit well with China, who, in return, baselessly accused Manila of hyping up the maritime situation in the area.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\n\u201cFirst, China has indisputable sovereignty over South China Sea Islands (which it called Nanhai Zhudao), and sovereign rights and jurisdiction over relevant waters. China is the first to have discovered, named, and explored and utilized South China Sea Islands and relevant waters, and the first to have exercised sovereignty and jurisdiction over them continuously, peacefully and effectively,\u201d said the foreign ministry spokesperson.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThe unnamed spokesperson likewise argued that China\u2019s supposed territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests in the South China Sea are \u201cbased on solid historical and legal grounds.\u201d\n\u201cChina\u2019s normal patrol, law enforcement and productive activities in waters under its own jurisdiction are consistent with international law, including the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, and such activities are beyond reproach,\u201d the official added.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nAmong China\u2019s arguments include its claim that the 2016 arbitral award, which invalidated China\u2019s then-nine dash claim, is illegal, null, and void.\nREAD:\nPH wins arbitration case over South China Sea\n\u201cWithout the Chinese government\u2019s prior consent, the Philippines unilaterally initiated an international arbitration, which violated international law, including UNCLOS, and the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea. The arbitral tribunal in the South China Sea arbitration handled the case ultra vires and made an illegitimate ruling. The rendered award is illegal, null and void,\u201d said the Chinese official.\n\u201cChina neither accepts nor participates in that arbitration, neither accepts nor recognizes the award, and will never accept any claim or action arising from the award. China\u2019s territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests in the South China Sea will not be affected by the award in any way. What the Philippines has been doing to glorify this illegal, invalid arbitral award does not help resolve its maritime disputes with China, still less justify its illegal claims in any way,\u201d the official furthered.\nChina also blamed the Philippine government, accusing it of \u201cbreaching commitments and common understandings with China\u201d by acting in bad faith.\n\u201cThe Philippines frequently infringed on China\u2019s rights and made provocations at sea, brought in forces outside the region to form blocs and flex muscles in the South China Sea, and spread disinformation to vilify China and mislead the international perception on this matter. In particular, driven by selfish geopolitical calculations, the US has played an extremely ignoble role by supporting and assisting the Philippines in infringing on China\u2019s sovereignty, and by exploiting the South China Sea issue to drive a wedge between China and other regional countries,\u201d said the unnamed spokesperson.\nChina then proceeded to ask who exactly the Philippine foreign policy serves now.\n\u201cThe answer is pretty clear to anyone with sound judgment. Trying desperately to justify the unjustifiable will not help the Philippines build trust with the international community. Countries in the region need to stay vigilant and always make sure that they themselves are the ones sitting in the driver\u2019s seat when it comes to the peace and stability of the South China Sea,\u201d the unnamed spokesperson added.\nChina\u2019s sweeping claim over most of the South China Sea, including the West Philippine Sea, has long been dismissed by an arbitral tribunal.\nYour subscription could not be saved.

        "content": "ILLUSTRATION BY RUTH MACAPAGAL\nThe subtraction effect is a phenomenon where people perceive the removal of a feature or option as having a more significant impact than its addition. For example, consider fast-food chains that used to provide sauce. As a result, they had to backtrack and offer unlimited free sauce again, which they must replenish periodically on demand. On the other hand, Chooks-to-Go, a chicken brand, never offered free sauce from the beginning. Despite this, they successfully expanded, even using the promotional tagline masarap kahit walang sauce (delicious even without sauce) in the past. Customers found value in the simplicity of their offer. This demonstrates that customers are not averse to the subtraction effect if certain features were not offered from the beginning. The successful market penetration of over 2,000 rotisserie chicken chains, despite the subtraction of sauce, showcases elements of innovation (start doing versus stop doing), which contributed to Bounty and its CEO Ronald Mascari\u00f1as winning the 2nd Mansmith Innovation Awards in 2022.\nBounty, along with its cooked chicken brands Chooks-to-Go and Uling Roasters, implemented another subtraction effect by eliminating a particular practice from their operating model: the use of antibiotics. Antibiotic resistance is a growing public health concern worldwide, and there is increasing awareness of the overuse of antibiotics in livestock farming, which impacts human health. Bounty and its retail brands introduced the market to the first all-natural, zero-antibiotics chicken using nonantibiotic ever (NAE) chicken technology. This differentiation has made Bounty, Chooks-to-Go and Uling Roasters the preferred choice for families seeking healthier and safer food options.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\n\u201cLess is more\u201d is a popular saying that entrepreneurs need to internalize. In a mentoring session at the Day 8 Business Academy for SMEs, the social enterprise division of Mansmith and Fielders, I advised a restaurant owner who was on the brink of closure to drastically reduce their menu items to just five. This change aimed to streamline operations and better cater to their target customers. The restaurant, located beside a hospital, mainly served hospital companions who were not regular customers. Despite offering an extensive menu, they had more food items than seats, resulting in unused ingredients and longer order times. They were advised to categorize their menu into soups, main courses and desserts, rather than listing them all as main items without a transaction-building plan. This strategy proved successful; new customers did not perceive any subtraction effect, and instead of shutting down, the restaurant owners decided to expand to another branch after turning their business around.\nFEATURED STORIES\nBUSINESS\nMore foreign brands seen coming to PH shores in 2025\nBUSINESS\nGlobal Dominion: Simplifying financing to empower every Filipino\nBUSINESS\nInternational group kicks off infrastructure investment drive for PH\nStrategic trade-offs\nA strategic trade-off refers to the decision-making process in which a business or organization prioritizes one course of action over another, recognizing that each option comes with its own advantages and disadvantages. This involves weighing the benefits and drawbacks of different choices and making a conscious decision to prioritize one aspect over another. There are strategic trade-offs in deciding which opportunities to pursue. Some entrepreneurs simply follow the crowd without understanding the underlying reasons\u2014a phenomenon known as the Law of Foolish Fellowship.\nStrategic trade-offs offer several benefits:\nArticle continues after this advertisement\n1. Resource allocation: By identifying and stopping activities that do not create value for consumers and the company, firms can reallocate resources to areas they want to emphasize or prioritize.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\n2. Differentiation: Firms can create a unique selling proposition by being different in a different way, resulting in a more sustainable competitive advantage.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\n3. Cost management: Stopping existing practices can lower costs, enabling firms to improve profits, reduce prices, or reallocate resources to newer initiatives. 4. Streamlined operations: By discontinuing low-value activities, companies can optimize their processes to improve performance.\nSubtraction neglect\nSubtraction neglect, as a cognitive bias, refers to the tendency to underestimate the impact of subtracting elements from a situation.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nMany companies tend to continuously add new features without considering the consequences, eventually creating a \u201cmore for less\u201d value proposition. However, when asked to remove existing features, they struggle, often citing customer satisfaction as an excuse. This behavior stems from subtraction neglect, as they fail to manage customer expectations effectively.\nHowever, there are exceptions\u2014courageous innovators who challenge industry assumptions. Examples include Chooks-to-Go\u2019s no-sauce policy, Union Bank\u2019s decision to refrain from physical branch expansion and GCash\u2019s emphasis on digital transactions over traditional telecommunication revenue. Internationally, Apple\u2019s limited SKU strategy and Netflix\u2019s elimination of late fees for DVD rentals exemplify the subtraction effect.\nPerhaps it\u2019s human nature to accumulate rather than remove, as evidenced by our tendency to fill our wardrobes with clothes.\nJosiah Go is the chair and chief innovation strategist of Mansmith and Fielders Inc.

        "content": "Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker on Rush Hour 3. Photo from New Line Cinema\nMany admirers of the Rush Hour film series have pondered the same question for quite some time: if\nRush Hour 4\nwill ever happen? In the \u201cRush Hour\u201d movies, the unconventional dynamic between the quick-witted protagonist from the West (Chris Tucker) and the ultra-skilled martial artist (Jackie Chan) from the East transcends the typical buddy cop movie formula. The film, featuring actors\nChris Tucker and Jackie Chan\n, established a significant bond between the African American and Chinese communities in cinema.\nIndeed, very few people anticipated that they would successfully collaborate and develop a friendship in reality, given their vast differences. Jackie Chan, a highly acclaimed and legendary Asian martial artist and actor with global recognition, was partnered with Chris Tucker, a renowned comedian known for his comedy in the 1990s and his affiliation with Hip-Hop culture. Chris Tucker\u2019s prominence in the entertainment industry rapidly increased following a series of successful comedic projects alongside established actors such as Charlie Sheen and Bruce Willis. The pairing of Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker was considered either a highly successful combination of actors or potentially the least favorable.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nFortunately, the casting created a unique dynamic due to the contrasting qualities of the actors, which ultimately complemented each other effectively. And those who watched the initial installment of Rush Hour witnessed it. All moviegoers enjoyed themselves while being amused by their performance and realizing that there is something special here.\nFEATURED STORIES\nENTERTAINMENT\nJericho Rosales raves over Janine Gutierrez's calendar girl stint\nENTERTAINMENT\nRetired cop finds trove of unreleased Michael Jackson songs \u2013 report\nENTERTAINMENT\nHow being a \u2018soft boy\u2019 empowered Maki to stay true to himself\nI vividly recall watching the first installment of the Rush Hour film series at a time marked by the release of subpar, boring, and uninteresting cinematic works. While waiting in line at the ticket booth at the cinema and considering the choices of movies, I ultimately chose \u201cRush Hour\u201d because of its perceived appeal, casting choices, and intriguing nature. My knowledge of Jackie Chan was limited, but I had heard of him and received a VHS of one of his films from the early 1990s from a relative in the States. Unfortunately, I am unable to recall for sure the title of the VHS as it was stolen but I believe it was \u201cTwin Dragons\u201d if my hazy memory serves me correctly on that one. This reminds me to always exercise caution when selecting \u201cfriends\u201d to invite into your residence because some of them could be planning to steal your belongings. Nevertheless, my recognition of Chris Tucker\u2019s comedic talent is based on his performances in the films \u201cFriday\u201d and \u201cThe Fifth Element.\u201d Thus, I anticipated that he would be entertaining at the very least with Jackie Chan.\nUpon getting to watch what would be the initial installment of the Rush Hour film series, I was impressed by its innovative and distinctive qualities relative to the period in which it was produced. The movie was remarkable for its time. Truly, New Line Cinema hit a nerve with moviegoers worldwide as they effectively breathed new life into the buddy cop formula while also introducing something original that has the potential for sequels if needed, with Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker at the helm of the succeeding movies.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThe enduring popularity of the Rush Hour movies is remarkable, considering the extended intervals between the films, notably the gap between the sequel and Rush Hour 3, which was predominantly filmed in Paris, France. The thrill of watching a newly released Rush Hour film was consistently present. Indeed, they were aging as we all were. But it still felt fresh to watch! And, of course, there was already a tried and tested proven formula present, but it never detracted from the joy of watching Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker kick butt.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nWhat a combination\u2013Jackie Chan showcased his exemplary martial arts skills, which are a blend of various Chinese martial arts, on the other hand, Chris Tucker displayed his own unique and effective \u201cso-so\u201d martial arts techniques. Haha.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThe two iconic actors collaboratively contribute to the cinematic magic through their effectiveness in various memorable scenes, including comedic dialogues, seamless line delivery, and action sequences. The intangible and undeniable comedic chemistry present when Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker are in a movie makes the Rush Hour films highly anticipated.\nThis reminds me of any moviegoer still wondering if there will be another sequel to their favorite movie. That is always a sign that the movie was not only entertaining to watch but also holds sentimental value. It brings the moviegoer back to a special time and place when they first watched the movie. Honestly, the Rush Hour movies bring people together because humor is truly universal. Anyone with a funny bone would find the Rush Hour movies to have a heart and a generous dose of action. Upon reflection, one could argue that the Rush Hour movies have perfected the formula of action-comedy buddy-cop movies, featuring two of the greatest actors capable of doing so, as compared to Mel Gibson and Danny Glover from the Lethal Weapon movies.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nI anticipate that the commencement of pre-production for Rush Hour 4 will occur soon, as this long, long-awaited project has been in developmental hell. Although Chris Tucker has consistently mentioned the possibility of another sequel, the certainty of its production remains contingent on official confirmation from Jackie Chan. Time does not pause for anyone, and \u201cRush Hour 4\u201d is likely to serve as their final performance.\nI hope there will be one soon before they get too old to reprise their iconic onscreen roles.

PHOTO FROM PHILJEC\nMANILA, Philippines\u2014A ranking official of the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) has identified agriculture as the backbone of the Philippine economy.\nIn a presentation at the 40th joint meeting last March of the Philippine-Japan Economic Cooperation (Philjec) and Japan-Philippines Economic Cooperation Committee (JPECC), JICA Philippines Chief Representative Sakamoto Takema cited data showing the pivotal role that agriculture plays in the Philippine economy.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nHe said in 2022, almost a quarter of the Philippine labor force is in agriculture.

This has gone down to just 77 percent in 2022, he said.\nBut the average rice yield per hectare has been improving over the years. Philippine rice yield is now higher than the average for countries in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean), he said.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nSakamoto said while efforts still have to be exerted to improve food production, it was also important to reduce post-harvest losses.\nHe cited as example the post-harvest loss rate in rice, which was estimated to be 15 percent compared to only eight percent in Vietnam.\nSakamoto said data showed that Philippine agriculture most needed modernization and development to bring higher income to farmers and provide a stable and affordable supply of food to Filipinos.\nJICA has had a rich history of cooperation in the agriculture sector in the Philippines, dating back to the 1970s.\nOver the decades, JICA has been supporting Philippine agriculture through the development infrastructure, like irrigation facilities and farm-to-market roads.\nJICA also brought Japanese technology, experts and programs to develop the skills of Filipino agricultural professionals, according to Sakamato.\nJICA\u2019s cooperation continues to evolve with current trends and needs of the agriculture sector.\nIn recent years, JICA has also incorporated market-oriented approaches and public-private partnership (PPP) promotion in its programs.\nPossible cooperation in improving post-harvest process in rice is being explored by JICA.\nSakamoto said to bring affordable food to Filipino consumers, there was a need to streamline, improve and modernize every stage of the value chain from production, logistics to marketing.\nConcerted efforts to attract more employment in the agriculture sector, through higher incomes, will be essential for sustainable development not only in the countryside but nationwide.\nSakamoto said the private sector will also play an increasingly important role in modernizing Philippine agriculture to complement collaborative efforts by farmers, government agencies and development partners, like JICA.\nHe asked Philippine and Japan private sector representatives at the forum to invest proactively in agriculture and take advantage of the sector\u2019s tremendous commercial opportunity.\nYour subscription could not be saved.

        "content": "This ever-changing changing world calls for opportunities to learn throughout life, for personal accomplishments, social interconnection, and economic success. However, post-pandemic learning has been altered by digital technology, and while it is an opportunity for growth, it has also been confronted by several challenges, for educators and learners alike.&nbsp; The questions now are: what positive difference can we impart to our learners using outstanding pedagogy amidst digital technology?&nbsp; How will children with learning deficiencies feel confident in the capabilities of a teacher? If the context of resilient learning extends beyond the educational norm, how could we help them become resilient students who will not be afraid to look out for learning opportunities throughout their lives?&nbsp;\nTo answer these questions, the NISAI group\nand UNESCO IITE, in partnership with INQUIRER.net, once again gathered all education stakeholders to the third and final installment of the interactive webinar series, billed as \u201cFostering Resilient Learners to best utilize lifelong learning opportunities\u201d. Highlighted in this series are valuable\ninsights from education experts and thought leaders such as Elizaveta Kondrashova, UNESCO IITE Programme Assistant; Laura Brown, Nisai Professional Development Institute (NPDI) Manager, and Anne Subashini Sivanathan, CEO of The Inclusive Outdoor Classroom.&nbsp; These speakers expressed their perceptions and studies about redefining and setting the framework for truly inclusive education in Asia in the age of technology and shared solutions about reframing the environment and mindsets for education equity and inclusion.&nbsp;\nThe United Nations\u2019 Sustainable Development Goals 2030 agenda for sustainable development includes the advocacy to champion quality of education that is equitable and inclusive for all (\nhttps://www.unesco.org/en/education2030-sdg4\n).&nbsp; This big picture, when broken down, reveals several opportunities as well as obstacles but the concept always comes home to a greater truth which is the ultimate objective of championing the expansion of every child\u2019s right to education, and providing opportunities for everyone despite the challenges.&nbsp;\nResilience is the attitude and ability to bounce back from challenges and thrive in the face of adversity, with adaptability, perseverance, and positivity\u2014all of which are lifelong skills. Perhaps the most tangible illustration of this is teachers and learners who have just emerged from the global pandemic experience and, despite the frenzied effects of the global health scare on the educational system and the abrupt incursion of digital technology, have continued coping and adjusting to the circumstances.&nbsp; While it is undeniable that digital technology has been ensconced not only as a knowledge provider but also as a co-creator of information and opportunity, some teachers, learners, and learning environments lack the facility and access to digital technology, especially in remote places in the country.&nbsp; Thus, when placed in parallel with the UN Inclusive Education Agenda, the Philippines still has a long way to go.&nbsp;\nEquitable access to technology for lifelong learning\nAmerican writer, sociologist, and futurist, Alvin Toffler, author of\nThe Third Wave\nand\nFuture Shock\n, once said: \u201c\nThe illiterate of the 21st century will not be those who cannot read and write, but those who cannot learn, unlearn, and relearn\u201d\n.&nbsp;\nToffler\u2019s vision was that society wasn\u2019t just changing but was changing faster than it ever had before, highlighting\nthe importance of lifelong learning in our day and age.\n\u201cThe overarching goal is to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning for all by committing to guarantee it through several principles which include equitable access, flexible learning pathways, functional literacy and numeracy, adult learning opportunities, and also strengthening Science, Technology, and Innovation, and harnessing Information and Communication Technology or ICT,\u201d Kondrashova said.&nbsp; Technology plays a major role in achieving lifelong learning in an increasingly online world thus, to be able to harness ICT and ensure equitable access to learning, people should be able to acquire and update their digital skills needed to fully participate in a modern economy.&nbsp; As such, digital skills are crucial to achieving key policy goals, including maintaining employability and well-being, and everyone\u2019s starting point should be to address digital inequality and barriers.&nbsp;\nLifelong learning, according to the UNESCO Institute for Lifelong Learning is rooted in the integration of learning and living, and the term \u2018lifelong\u2019 would mean from-cradle-to-grave life-wide learning for people of all ages, delivered and undertaken through a variety of modalities and meeting a wide range of learning needs and demands. In education, digital technology can offer innovative ways to engage, support, and access learners and provide them with new opportunities for new adaptive, personalized, and responsive learning.&nbsp; \u201cThe influx of digital technology and Artificial Intelligence (AI) offer more and more potentially unlimited opportunities to contextualize learning and allow more responsive learning activities that answer learning demands.&nbsp; That is the real advantage of ICT, again, but only if we utilize and manage them properly,\u201d Kondrashova reminded. This is mainly because digitalization still offers a risk of not serving the interest of the learners.&nbsp; What\u2019s more significant, she pointed out, is learning within people\u2019s lives, communities, and social groups, and providing opportunities for personalized lifelong learning management systems and real-time responsive learning activities.&nbsp;\nICT can be empowering, promoting extra opportunities for lifelong learning and inclusive education, but can also create additional hindrances which could prevent social inclusion and create a digital divide. \u201cEducators should focus on education and lifelong opportunities, with emphasis on e-inclusive teaching and learning, social community integration, vocational education, and guidance, promoting ICT skills development among teachers,\u201d she emphasized.&nbsp;\nDeveloping educational opportunities for all\nWhile the current keyword is inclusion, exclusion should also be discussed as it could obviously cause further risk for the development of disadvantaged children. According to Laura Brown, students with Educational Needs and Disabilities (SEND) make up 17% of overall learners but given the 50% of exclusions within schools is proof enough that equality is not present.&nbsp; Given the special needs of children in this segment, exclusion will result in lower expectations of what they can achieve and outcomes due to missed opportunities. \u201cIf equality is not there, they don\u2019t have equal opportunities to start with, then we can\u2019t build further from that,\u201d she explained and further assured that the Nisai group is looking to improve this circumstance and ensure that systems are there for learners to be able to continue to engage.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\u201cSome students need structure and routine, and exclusion of any option will break the structure and could put them into further disadvantage because they have to overcome the emotional barriers before they could get back to that same level,\u201d Brown explained. \u201cThe academic and social impact is that they won\u2019t be learning all. They won\u2019t be able to develop communication skills, they will have poorer relationships with their peers, and eventually, will have limited opportunities in the workforce, something that education and teaching information must deal with,\u201d she added.&nbsp;\nShe also strongly recommends avoiding segregation as learners could see the different tasks assigned to them according to their capabilities (or lack thereof).&nbsp; Instead, educators should bring everybody together for a fully inclusive teaching opportunity, where everyone enjoys the same chances and achieves the same potential.&nbsp; \u201cWe need to see the long-term effect of segregation and how we break stereotypes to disrupt that cycle. The way that we consider bias toward students is important for teachers and all professionals engaged within education. Breaking that cycle and giving every learner a free start to try again and try their best could help them reach and unleash their maximum potential.\u201d she reiterated.&nbsp;\nSpeaking resilience is key to empowering both educators and learners\nWhile digital technology is crucial in achieving all educational objectives, teachers in general find ICT challenging thus, speaking about resilience with them first before one could even allow them to empower the students is key. Particularly, reality highlights that some Filipino families lack technology, have no access to Wi-Fi, or if they have it, they lack the proper devices. This would mean that some of our children have missed out on well-deserved opportunities. Apart from the limited or no access to ICT, lack of funding and personnel, plus some students\u2019 learning disabilities vis-a-vis the ever-changing ICT landscape, are supplementary issues that should be considered.&nbsp;\n\u201cThis is difficult for our teachers especially those with students under five years old, and with disabilities. The mission, however, is to ensure that both teachers and students are not left out. To supplement learning, online courses could connect us with those who have expertise on these issues and concerns\u201d, Anne Subashini Sivanathan expressed. To add to these concerns, educators must value the importance of looking at the child as a child\u2014even with their learning incapacities\u2014and not as a setback.&nbsp; Instead, educators should focus on strength identification and strength learning so they could encourage a growth mindset and teach their students (and themselves) about problem-solving skills that promote self-reflection and improvement.\nBrown also recommended online learning platforms that give equal opportunities for teachers and students who have been let down by mainstream education. Teachers, particularly, need to boost their ICT competence through online courses dedicated to inclusive education.&nbsp; There are open and distance learning solutions for teachers in dealing with students with disabilities and soon, a course on Gender equality in education and how to access ICT equality will soon be available at\nhttps://elibrary.iite.unesco.org/\n. \u201cThese online learning tools can be used to develop new skills, build coping strategies, and could allow both teachers and students to share their emotions as they recover from the traumatic 2020.&nbsp; This will provide better training for staff and offer a better quality of support and encourage improved outcomes.&nbsp; On their part, students will be confident that they won\u2019t be judged and they will be supported, despite their vulnerabilities,\u201d Brown clarified.\nResiliency and lifelong learning should be a concerted effort\nResilience is crucial as it helps learners overcome obstacles and encourages lifelong learning for continuous growth.&nbsp; The call to action now is to foster that kind of resilience and to get from here to that goal, inclusivity and equity are important steppingstones.&nbsp; However, the truth is equity recognizes that one size doesn\u2019t fit all and while mainstream education is great for most students, it is not beneficial to all of them, and we need to offer a suitable alternative which that will work for all.&nbsp; The first step is to make the teaching staff more resilient by building appropriate expectations, allowing for growth and plans.&nbsp;&nbsp;\nQuality education starts with the resilience of educators because what makes a good positive classroom is a safe, stable, and secure learning environment.&nbsp; Resilient learners are created by resilient teachers.&nbsp; We need to ensure that schools are equipped properly and that teachers can efficiently use ICT.&nbsp; Supporting teachers in their goal to be better equipped with ICT skills could encourage capacity building, boost their technology proficiency, and make them more confident to impart learning.&nbsp;\nApart from teachers, there must be a concerted effort to bring together dedicated teaching staff and school personnel, supportive families, and the community to make academic goals easier to achieve through collaborative teamwork.&nbsp; The families of these students should get involved, making sure that every child has a safe and stable household, and likewise their peers, the wider school network, including all professionals within and outside of the school, and the community in general.&nbsp; Parents who have children with SEND could connect with other parents who are in the same circumstances so they can learn from each other\u2019s experiences, sharing techniques about what works for them and what doesn\u2019t, and being able to bond together to be a louder voice to push for change.&nbsp;\nThere is also a need to work with policymakers, in the community at large, and build that social connection that is focused on the education and development of all children.&nbsp; This supportive relations and tight-knit community will give children a sense of belonging, opportunities for skill building, decision making and planning, and social and cultural integration. This is not all about the curriculum, it\u2019s all about how we approach the child and his education, in the wider social context.&nbsp;\nIndeed, as a popular African proverb states, \u201cit takes a village to raise a child\u201d, people\u2019s learning experience are framed by an everyday life perspective and learning always takes place in our lives, when we interact with our community or the society groups we belong.&nbsp; Inclusive education is integral to lifelong learning and requires the active participation of learners, families, communities, and the government. This will only be achieved through collaborative design, meeting diverse needs, and valuing inter-disciplinary, physical, cognitive, and emotional diversity and diversity of background (age, gender, disability, social status, among many others) and seeing it as a jump-off point rather than an obstacle.&nbsp;\nWhile we have triumphantly survived the pandemic, it has also opened our eyes that there may still be challenges ahead thus, our children should be armed with the resilience to bounce back from any crisis and develop the kind of grit to stand up, dust off the remnants of these challenges, and move forward, knowing that everything is going to be all right.&nbsp; This is why we all have an important central role to play and make a difference in the character-building and lifelong learning of our children.&nbsp; It is about time that we do the tasks expected of us as teachers, parents, family, professionals, and public servants, so that\u2014with our concerted effort and dedication\u2014we will slowly ignite the spark and move institutions and government to action for the betterment of education, learning, and the safe and stable future which all children rightfully deserve.&nbsp;\nADVT.\nREAD NEXT\n2 Chinese warships seen tailing PH, France, US fleet in WPS dr...\nMalabon City Administrator highlights housing strategies to he...\nEDITORS' PICK\nEnforce discount laws,&nbsp;commuters tell LTFRB\nSMNI duo ordered&nbsp;to pay TV journo&nbsp;P2M in damages\nHealing Manila, mayoral bet Isko Moreno\u2019s Ospital ng Maynila legacy\nBar exam result 2024: 3,962 passed \u2013 Supreme Court\nPH asserts rights over Bajo de Masinloc at UN General Assembly\nPVL: Deanna Wong moving closer to Choco Mucho return\nMOST READ\nComelec exempts 48 projects from election ban\nBar exam 2024: List of successful examinees\n3 schools have highest percentage of passers among first-time bar exam takers\nHouse panel: Ex-president Duterte center of grand criminal enterprise\nFollow\n@FMangosingINQ\non Twitter\n-->\nView comments",

Image: Instagram/@iamhearte\nWhen\nHeart Evangelista\nwas finding her footing in the entertainment industry, she was told she wouldn\u2019t be cast in a drama due to her Chinita features. This made her insecure about her looks before eventually learning to embrace her beauty.\nEvangelista started her showbiz career in 2000 when she took on the role of Missy Sandejas in \u201cG-mik.\u201d She also appeared on \u201cArriba, Arriba,\u201d \u201cTara Tena: Share A Home, Share A Heart,\u201d and other sitcoms before transitioning into drama. Years later, she was announced as the new face of a local makeup brand.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\n\u201cBefore, feeling ko isa ako sa unang Chinita n\u2019ung time na \u2018yun. In fact, I remember feeling so discriminated because may nagsabi sa\u2019kin na hindi ako pwede mag-telenovela kasi masyadong maliit ang mata ko, hindi ako makakapag-express. I felt so hurt,\u201d she recalled in a media conference moments before the GRWM Ball, where she was accompanied by entrepreneur and beauty maven Mae Layug.\nFEATURED STORIES\nENTERTAINMENT\nJericho Rosales raves over Janine Gutierrez's calendar girl stint\nENTERTAINMENT\nRetired cop finds trove of unreleased Michael Jackson songs \u2013 report\nENTERTAINMENT\nHow being a \u2018soft boy\u2019 empowered Maki to stay true to himself\n\u201cI felt that I needed to have bigger eyes, and I needed to change my look.

In fact, I remember feeling so discriminated against because I was told I couldn\u2019t star in telenovelas because my eyes were so small. I couldn\u2019t express my feelings well. I felt so hurt.

She also taught herself to change her mindset and embrace what makes her different.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\n\u201cSome people are different, which in a way, would make you click. So that\u2019s how I changed my mindset,\u201d she said. \u201cI was able to embrace my features and who I am, and when I became more confident, I saw a huge difference in just being yourself.\u201d\nOn defining beauty, staying in PH\nEvangelista is also a believer that beauty is more than skin deep. And instead of a person\u2019s \u201cface card,\u201d it\u2019s about the aura that makes one stand out.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\n\u201cIt\u2019s about your charm or should I say, your aura. We live in a world where everything is so fast-paced. We\u2019re all evolving. But haven\u2019t you noticed that some women, despite being in their 50s or 60s, they\u2019re still beautiful? Because it\u2019s their aura, charm, and personality,\u201d she said.\n\u201cThat\u2019s what a true face card is. It\u2019s not about how beautiful or how beautiful they think he is. It\u2019s not about what\u2019s seen but about what\u2019s felt,\u201d she further explained.\nHeart Evangelista during an intimate media conference in Para\u00f1aque.

        "content": "Setbacks are part of every athlete\u2019s journey. Filipino pole vaulter EJ Obiena, a Southeast Asian Games&nbsp; record holder, faced his own at the 2024 Paris Olympics. Though he narrowly missed the bronze, his&nbsp; determination remains an inspiration. While this could have been a defining moment in his career for&nbsp; many, Obiena saw it as a chance to show his indomitable spirit. His story of perseverance endeared him&nbsp; even more to his fellow Filipinos.&nbsp;\nObiena sets his sights for greater achievements. When asked about his plans leading up to the 2028&nbsp; Olympics in Los Angeles, he admits that it\u2019s difficult to provide a concrete answer. However, he eagerly&nbsp; anticipates the future, stating, \u201c\nI\u2019m planning for next year, I need to decide where I\u2019m going to be training.&nbsp; Where are the training camps? We have both indoor and outdoor world championship in Asia, which is in&nbsp; China and Japan. So therefore, I\u2019m looking around, but I know that I have a place here, Vermosa, and&nbsp; soon it\u2019s going to be perfect. There\u2019s a few more in the works, but as of now, it\u2019s already looking like this is&nbsp; where I want to be training at.\u201d\nObiena shared.&nbsp;\nEJ Obiena, brand ambassador for Vermosa, trains at the Ayala Vermosa Sports Hub (AVSH) when in the&nbsp; Philippines. As he looks towards the future, Obiena\u2019s vision reaches beyond personal success\u2014he\u2019s&nbsp; committed to growing and elevating the pole-vaulting sport for the nation. He is driven by a desire to&nbsp; inspire the next generation of athletes. And at the heart of this ambition lies Vermosa. This Ayala Land&nbsp; estate in Imus, Cavite, with its world-class facilities and commitment to sports development, facilitates an&nbsp; opportunity for the Philippines to establish itself as a force to be reckoned with in the world of pole&nbsp; vaulting and other sports. It also enables the potential for sports excellence of kids from the grassroots.&nbsp;&nbsp;\nBeyond the physical infrastructure, Vermosa also offers comprehensive sports development programs&nbsp; that focus on coaching, sports science, and athlete well-being. Obiena envisions these programs as the&nbsp; driving force behind the Philippines\u2019 rise in pole vaulting, providing aspiring athletes with the guidance,&nbsp; resources, and support they need to reach their full potential.&nbsp;&nbsp;\nObiena expressed his commitment to empowering the youth and imparting his knowledge of sports. The&nbsp; Philippines is currently experiencing a surge of interest in the Olympics, marking a golden age for sports.&nbsp;\n\u201cI think we should capitalize on that inspiration of kids, \u2018I want to try this sport. I want to try weightlifting,&nbsp; gymnastics, and pole vault.\u2019 And with that, Ayala Land and Vermosa definitely, definitely stepped up.&nbsp; Therefore, we\u2019re planning a few clinics to make sure that these kids hopefully are going to be the next&nbsp; champions. We have a facility; we have housing for them. It\u2019s a perfect ecosystem for high performance&nbsp; events and high-performance athletic prowess,\u201d\nhe said.&nbsp;\nObiena also recognizes the importance of raising the stature of pole vaulting in the Philippines. Through&nbsp; his own success on the international stage and the success of the athletes he helps nurture, he aims to&nbsp; inspire a newfound appreciation for the sport among the Filipino public. This, in turn, will drive greater&nbsp; investment, support, and participation in pole vaulting at all levels.&nbsp;\nVermosa\u2019s state-of-the-art training facilities provide athletes and sports enthusiasts with the tools they&nbsp; need to hone their skills and push the boundaries of their performance. Obiena also finds the&nbsp; convenience of having everything he needs within the estate helps him maintain focus,\n\u201cVermosa is a&nbsp; perfect camp, perfect place to actually grow and train and really focus. Athletes who want to focus and&nbsp; really dive deep into it can do training camps there. I wake up, I don\u2019t need to drive. I walk to the track.&nbsp;\nAfter I train, I have my food there, I have my place to rest. I have my physios, I have the gym, I have the&nbsp; pool. All of these things would lead you into obsessing and being able to fully utilize your time into your&nbsp; sport. And that\u2019s what Vermosa really provides. And more than just that, the high level of facility that they&nbsp; provide is a plus,\n\u201d Obiena said.&nbsp;\nWith Vermosa as the center of this plan, Obiena\u2019s dreams for the future of Philippine pole vaulting are well&nbsp; within reach. He envisions the development of dedicated training facilities and clinics in Vermosa that will&nbsp; cater specifically to pole vaulting, providing invaluable support and guidance to young athletes.&nbsp;&nbsp;\nObiena believes that Vermosa is the perfect destination for both athletes and individuals who love staying&nbsp; active.\n\u201cBecause of first the facility, it\u2019s a plus for us because we get to do all of it, but for everyone who\u2019s&nbsp; doing swimming, they have the pool there. It\u2019s a very good pool. You have the gym, it\u2019s high quality. And&nbsp; of course, the track. And with the track, I know how it was set up and how it was more or less planned. It\u2019s&nbsp; a perfect place for me.\u201d\nObiena shared.&nbsp;\nVermosa\u2019s commitment to creating a vibrant community of athletes, coaches, and enthusiasts is a key&nbsp; aspect of its sports development vision. By bringing together like-minded individuals who share a passion&nbsp; for sports, Vermosa aims to cultivate an environment that is both supportive and inspiring, further fueling&nbsp; the growth and development of the sport in the Philippines.&nbsp;&nbsp;\nADVT.\nThis article is brought to you by Ayala Land.\nREAD NEXT\nNBA: Officials made correct calls in Warriors-Rockets game\nJustine Baltazar opens his Converge stint with&nbsp;a&nbsp;loss\nEDITORS' PICK\nHouse panel: Duterte center of grand criminal enterprise\nP40 per kilo rice now available in more public markets\nSOCIAL CLIMATE: Life has shortened\nRetired cop finds trove of unreleased Michael Jackson songs \u2013 report\nFilipino film \u2018Haligi\u2019 considered for Golden Globes\n2 PH enterprises recognized as Asia's best innovators\nMOST READ\nComelec exempts 48 projects from election ban\n3 schools have highest percentage of passers among first-time bar exam takers\nBar exam 2024: List of successful examinees\nPhilHealth: P138M allocation for 2025 anniversary not Christmas party\nFollow\n@FMangosingINQ\non Twitter\n-->\nView comments",

France Castro claimed that a police officer fired a gun at a motorcycle rider near her vehicle when she was stuck in traffic in Bonifacio Global City (BGC), Taguig on Wednesday night.\nCastro, during her manifestation at the House of Representatives quad committee hearing on Thursday, said that two police officers went out of their patrol car, which was positioned in front of her vehicle, after a man aboard a motorbike moved near the cops.\nOne of the police officers supposedly fired his gun in an area crowded with civilians, which Castro deemed improper.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\n\u201cThis is both a personal and collective privilege because it concerns my safety.

(Senate Public Relations and Information Bureau)\nMANILA, Philippines \u2014 Sen. Ronald \u201cBato\u201d dela Rosa questioned the legality of the agreement between the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PhilHealth), Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP), and Tingog Party-list on the construction of hospitals and clinics nationwide.\nIn a privilege speech during the Senate\u2019s plenary session Wednesday, dela Rosa said the agreement is meant to pave the way for the Rural Financing Health Development Program.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nCiting a circulating unsigned copy of the memorandum of agreement (MOA) between PhilHealth, DBP, and Tingog, the senator said the program intends to address gaps in healthcare infrastructure in rural areas.\nFEATURED STORIES\nNEWSINFO\nBar exam 2024: List of successful examinees\nNEWSINFO\n3 schools have highest percentage of passers among first-time bar exam takers\nNEWSINFO\nHouse panel: Ex-president Duterte center of grand criminal enterprise\n\u201cIyan daw po ang tawag nila sa proyekto na kanilang gustong iimplementa sa bisa ng kanilang naging kasunduan. Mas maraming health facilities sa rural areas, realization ng Universal Health Care Act, at reduction ng mortality at morbidity rates sa pamamagitan ng pagtatayo ng primary health care facilities ang kanilang layunin,\u201d he said.\n(They say that\u2019s the program they want to implement according to their agreement. They want more health facilities in rural areas, realizing the Universal Health Care Act, and reducing mortality and morbidity rates by putting up primary&nbsp;health care facilities.)\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nHowever, dela Rosa smelled something fishy about the pact.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\n\u201cBakit kaya mas pinili ng DBP at PhilHealth na makasama sa kanilang MOA ang isang Partylist kaysa sa Department of Health (DOH)? Gusto ko rin pong malinawan,\u201d he said.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\n(Why did DBP and PhilHealth partner with a partylist instead of the DOH?)\nREAD:\nRomualdez, Tingog party-list to provide aid to Mindanao quake victims\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nAccording to the senator, the DOH has the mandate to provide technical assistance, consultation, and advisory services to stakeholders regarding the regulation of health facilities. He added that the DOH issues the \u201cCertificate of Need\u201d whenever a government or private entity desires to establish a new hospital.\n\u201cSa isang banda, nakakapagtaka rin po kung bakit hindi rin mas pinili ng DBP at PhilHealth ang Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG) na siyang may mandato to exercise general supervision over local government units?\u201d dela Rosa further asked.\n(On the one hand, it is also surprising why DBP and PhilHealth did not prefer the Department of Interior and Local Government, which has the mandate to exercise general supervision over local government units.)\nHe likewise expressed doubts whether Tingog Partylist can assist and coordinate with local government units in ensuring their participation in the program intended to rehabilitate, expand, or construct hospitals \u2013 more than the DOH and DILG can.\nREAD:\nRomualdez, Tingog party-list facilitate release of P117-M aid to typhoon-hit areas\n\u201cAng tanong ng lahat sa kasunduan na pinirmahan ng PhilHealth, DBP, at Tingog Partylist: Legal ba ito? Ethical ba ito? Hinaluan at hahaluan ba ng politika ang mga programang pangkalusugan? Masasabi ba natin na ito\u2019y purong etikal at legal, at walang halong adyendang pulitikal? Mayroon po bang nalalabag na batas kagaya ng mga paratang ng ibang mga nakapansin sa timing ng programang ito?\u201d asked dela Rosa.\n(The question is whether the agreement signed by PhilHealth, DBP, and Tingog Partylist is legal. Is it ethical? Does this conceal a political agenda hidden in the form of a health program? Can we say that this is purely ethical and legal without the trace of political agenda? Did this violate a law, similar to what was pointed out by those who first noticed this program?)\nDela Rosa then clarified that he is not opposing a program meant to help Filipinos, but that he only wants the process to be in accordance with the law.\n\u201cNakakalungkot po na tila inaasa sa pulitika ang kalusugan ng ating mga mamamayan.

PHOTO FROM HREP\nMANILA, Philippines \u2014 Former Bureau of Customs (BOC) intelligence officer Jimmy Guban has accused a so-called Davao group of being behind the smuggling of various items \u2014 including agricultural products \u2014 in its heyday during the past administration.\nDuring the thirteenth hearing of the House of Representatives\u2019 quad committee on Thursday, Guban was asked by Lanao del Sur 1st District Rep. Zia Alonto Adiong if former Customs broker Mark Taguba\u2019s remarks about the Davao group were true \u2014 that while it was not part of BOC, it had a strong influence in Customs deals.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nIn response, Guban said that a huge part of the tara \u2014 a grease money system that Taguba admitted to have existed \u2014 goes to the Davao group.\nFEATURED STORIES\nNEWSINFO\nBar exam 2024: List of successful examinees\nNEWSINFO\n3 schools have highest percentage of passers among first-time bar exam takers\nNEWSINFO\nHouse panel: Ex-president Duterte center of grand criminal enterprise\n\u201cThat is correct, your Honor, from the start of 2016.&nbsp; In fact, even \u2018yong positioning sa Bureau nanggagaling sa Davao group.&nbsp; Kaya si Mark ay nag-eenroll sa Davao group para mabilis ang facilitation ng kargamento nila.&nbsp; So \u2018yong P40,000 na sinasabi niyo, \u2018yon \u2018yong may resibo lang na pumapasok sa Customs.&nbsp; Maybe P10,000 or P15,000 sa shipping line.&nbsp; And the rest of that, do\u2019n na \u2018yon sa grupo ng Davao group,\u201d Guban said.\n(That is correct, your Honor, from the start of 2016.&nbsp; In fact, even the positioning in the Bureau came from Davao group.&nbsp; That\u2019s why Mark enrolled payments to the Davao group so that their cargo would be quickly facilitated.&nbsp; So the P40,000 that you are saying, that\u2019s that only transaction with receipts, that came into Customs.&nbsp; Maybe P10,000 or P15,000 to the shipping line.&nbsp; And the rest of that is for the Davao group.)\nArticle continues after this advertisement\n\u201cSo regardless na po \u2018yon kung anong klase ng kargamento ang papasok [we accept it] which is kaya nag-proliferate ang illegal drugs, pati na ho agricultural products ang dami po no\u2019n kasi hindi kontrolado ng Customs officials ang Bureau of Customs.&nbsp; It\u2019s the Davao group that was controlling during that time,\u201d he added.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\n(So regardless of what kind of cargo was coming in, we accepted it, which was why illegal drugs proliferated, and even agricultural products were smuggled because Customs officials did not control BOC.&nbsp; It was the Davao group controlling during that time.)\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nQuad committee lead presiding officer and Surigao del Norte 2nd District Rep. Robert Ace Barbers noticed that Customs Police official Maj. Camilo Cascolan Jr. agreed with what Guban was saying.\n\u201cI saw Major Cascolan nodding his head eh, does that mean that you are confirming what Jimmy Guban is saying?&nbsp; So you are aware about this kind of system?\u201d Barbers asked.\nArticle continues after this advertisement\n\u201cYes, your Honor, it has been the system, your Honor,\u201d Cascolan replied.\nLater on, La Union 1st District Rep. Paolo Ortega asked Guban and Taguba about the Davao group, to which the former BOC official said the organization was a hot commodity \u201cfrom the start of the oath-taking to Malaca\u00f1ang,\u201d referring to former President Rodrigo Duterte\u2019s term.\nTaguba meanwhile implicated Duterte\u2019s son, Davao City 1st District Rep. Paolo Duterte, as head of the Davao group.\n\u201cWho do you think is the head or leader of this Davao group?\u201d Ortega asked.\n\u201cWell, I think it\u2019s Paolo Duterte,\u201d Taguba said.\n\u201cIs that common knowledge in your workplace before?&nbsp; Was this talked about normally, like it\u2019s being passed around, it\u2019s not uncertain, and you cannot say that you are not sure?\u201d Ortega pressed.\n\u201cYes po, your Honor,\u201d Taguba replied.\nINQUIRER.net has contacted Rep. Duterte\u2019s office for his comment on the issue, but his staffer said that the lawmaker would not issue a statement since they do not know each other.\nThis is not the first time that Taguba and Guban implicated the younger Duterte as supposedly involved in smuggling.\nAt the first quad committee hearing in Pampanga last August 16,\nGuban said he was cautioned against naming Rep. Duterte\n, his brother-in-law and Vice President Sara Duterte\u2019s husband Manases Carpio, and businessman Michael Yang as involved in the \u201cshabu\u201d importation mess.\nRep. Duterte however questioned Guban\u2019s credibility, saying that\nhe does not know Guban\nand that he has never transacted with the former BOC official.&nbsp; The lawmaker also noted that the label \u201cstar witness\u201d is only reserved for individuals with credibility and not Guban, who had been cited for contempt by the Senate blue ribbon committee.\nTaguba meanwhile claimed during a previous quad committee hearing that\nhe never retracted his allegations that Rep. Duterte was involved\nin the P6.4-billion shabu shipment smuggled through the BOC in 2017.\nYour subscription could not be saved.

Grace Poe said: \u201cAt the heart of our economic recovery lies our unwavering dedication to creating jobs and stimulating growth. Investing in infrastructure is very important, that\u2019s why we have increased the funds of different agencies in relation to this.\u201d\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nPoe, who defended the national spending plan as chair of the Senate finance committee, noted that the budget of the defense sector has also been increased, stressing the importance of national security.\nREAD:\nOVP budget cut stays; big gains for DPWH, House\nArticle continues after this advertisement\nThe bicam panel gave a P271.9-billion budget to the Department of National Defense (DND), up from the P263 billion earlier approved by the House of Representatives.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve increased the funding of the DND to fund critical projects, including the Kalayaan Island sheltered port and the Pag-asa airport. These are strategic investments that underscore our commitment to asserting our territorial integrity,\u201d Poe explained.\nIn the reconciled version, the soldiers\u2019 subsistence allowance was likewise raised from P150 to P350 a day, or P10,500 a month.\nOther gainers\n\u201cWe honor our soldiers, the front-liners of our nation\u2019s defense, by ensuring that they have the resources they need to fulfill their duties,\u201d she added.\nThe budget of the Philippine Coast Guard was increased by P800 million to P33.2 billion \u201cto ensure that our coastlines are patrolled and secured, safeguarding not just our territory but also the livelihoods of our beloved fisherfolk.\u201d\nThe Department of Foreign Affairs also received a P500-million adjustment in its budget to P27.6 billion to \u201cstrengthen our diplomatic missions and ensure that our country\u2019s interests are upheld and our voice is heard in the international community,\u201d Poe said.\nShe added that they have funded the operations of the courts and the social lawyering fund to ensure fast and fair attainment of justice.\n\u201cWe also bolstered the fight against human trafficking and child sexual abuse as well as cybercrimes through increased funding for our justice sector,\u201d Poe said.\nThe budget for the Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT) was also jacked up by P4 billion to P12.4 billion \u201cto expand our digital literacy efforts so that more Filipinos can keep up with the ever-changing and evolving technology.\u201d\n\u201cWe did the same for the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) for better traffic management that will alleviate congestion and boost productivity in Metro Manila,\u201d Poe said.\nFocus on infrastructure\nThe MMDA will see an increase of P3 billion in its 2025 budget to P8.8 billion.\nIn a bid to support sustainable tourism programs that provide livelihood in various communities, lawmakers also approved an increase of P300 million in the budget of the Department of Tourism to P3.8 billion next year.\nPoe said the National Economic and Development Authority will also be given additional funds\u2014from the House-approved P12.29 billion to the bicam panel\u2019s P12.35 billion\u2014to ensure that government projects are according to a master plan that would provide jobs to millions of Filipinos.\n\u201cWe recognize the growing frequency and intensity of natural disasters. Our response is more robust funding for disaster preparedness and rehabilitation. For instance, increasing the funds of the Department of Agrarian Reform shows our desire to support our farmers, especially after disasters,\u201d Poe said.\nShe added that the Liwanag at Tubig Assistance Welfare, or Litaw Program, a groundbreaking initiative to restore electricity and water access for low-income households in times of calamities and natural disasters, has also been funded.\nThe senator said the 2025 budget also ensured continuous support for social protection programs, including the building of more rural health units, Department of Health, and local government hospitals, as well as new urgent care ambulatory services.\nSubstantial cuts\nOn the other hand, CHEd was allocated P33.3 billion for next year, or P3.4 billion lower than its 2024 budget of P36.7 billion, while the P122.2-billion allotment for SUCs in 2025 was P5.8 billion less than this year\u2019s P128 billion.\nOf the SUCs, the University of the Philippines system got the lion\u2019s share with P22.7 billion, which was still P2 billion lower than its P24.8-billion budget this year.\nActivists slammed the lack of transparency in the bicam conference committee report despite the public clamor to open it to the public.\n\u201cDespite the supposed public nature of the deliberation, the public was still kept in the dark on the particulars of the amendments adopted,\u201d said Bayan chair Teddy Casino. \u201cA genuine people\u2019s budget should prioritize the needs of ordinary Filipinos\u2014health, education and livelihood.\u201d\nMalaca\u00f1ang said on Thursday that the 2025 national budget would be enacted by President Marcos before Christmas Day.\nIn a statement, the Presidential Communications Office (PCO) said it was waiting for Congress to transmit the ratified version of the 2025 GAB.\n\u201cFollowing standard practice, the Congress-approved national budget bill will be transmitted to the Office of the President for review.
